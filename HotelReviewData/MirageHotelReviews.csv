30,Outrageous prices for food and drinks. Buffet restaurant suspiciously closed. Our room had a rusty bathtub. Housekeeping didn’t service room until we extra asked. The common areas including the casino smell terribly of air freshener which makes me wonder what they would smell like without. Have been here in the past with much better experiences. Disappointed this time around.
40,We visited over 10 years and not a great deal had changed so it is probably time for the upgrade. Although the rooms are ready for the update we were still pleased with what was on offer. Spacious and very clean rooms very comfortable beds and surprisingly very little corridor noise (the doors do slam though!) On arrival we decided to get an extra room and the reception staff were very helpful. With snow in Vegas we couldn’t really use the pool facilities but still had to pay the resort fee. Due to a flight issue we also had to spend a night in an off Strip Vegas hotel with no resort fee and the facilities were much better - in room fridge tea & coffee machine complimentary water sensible bar prices - why can’t this be part of the resort fee? All of the food venues charge…
10,"Extremally disappointing and over priced stay. We paid a ridiculous amount for ""resort"" fees. Yet there was not even an open pool worth going in. like they advertised. One of the other reasons we chose this hotel was the fact that there was a circ show and magic show. Well of course the magician was not there for the 6 nights we were there... which we did not know. And Love was awful. We had our 7 year old daughter who was so excited for this. as we all were. and it was horribly boring and just awful. she fell asleep. she was able to make it to 2-3 am every night. except the horribly over priced and boring Love. they also told me we get %20 off tickets when staying at the mirage. but again. Not true. California pizza was great. the only positive. yet there are other California…"
40,This hotel has not changed in many years but it is so well maintained  you'd never guess how old everything is. The room was beautiful. The only complaint I had was the walk to the elevators is unreal! My husband and I both have problems and we thought we'd never get to our room. Prepare yourself for this if you have issues. As everywhere in Vegas food and drinks are expensive. We ate at the mexican restaurant and it was excellent. problem was we had left overs and the room had a frig - a frig full of booze. no room for anything else. fortunately I brought a small cooler bag and used that.
50,Loved our stay! This hotel was clean comfortable and fun. The staff were really friendly and the amenities available are great. We watched the Super Bowl at the sports book in the hotel which was awesome and loved all the dining options available. Sooooo sad the mirage will be going!
50,The Mirage is a Wonderful Hotel with staff that treat you like royalty. The rooms are wonderful nice mattresses and pillows. Everything is kept so clean. You couldn't ask for a better place to stay
50,The Mirage is now taken over by the Hard Rock group and the service was INCREDIBLE! I had booked a standard room for arrival this week to enjoy my birthday but when I got there the desk clerk said that regretfully they had been overbooked and my standard room was not available. But they were assigning a better room for me to make up for it. When he said what it was I figured he was kidding...but he wasn't --- they put me in a PENTHOUSE SUITE! It was fantastic!
50,I love the Mirage and will certainly miss it the way it is. However I do look forward to see how Hard Rock establishes itself here in Vegas. Our recent visit this February was top notch! Staff everywhere was friendly and attentive. The casino was clean and well staffed with security for your safety. I truly appreciated that. The rooms are a bit tired but that will soon change under the new owners. Good Luck Hard Rock!!
30,Great location The location is right in the center which is great but the rooms are old and outdated. The bathroom is small with very low ceilings. Drainage was awful in the shower. Casino is nice and spacious. You have a lot of options of places to eat.
50,We have just returned from 4 wonderful nights at the clean and beautiful Mirage with our miniature Australian Shepherd. We planned on 2 nights but had so much fun and were so comfortable we stayed longer. Excellent room service food from The Pantry. Loved seeing the Beatles Cirque De Soleil. And yummy lobster tacos at the Still. Every worker was friendly. We will come back!
20,We stay 1 night in Sin City because of the flight schedule. The iconic hotel was not what I was expecting. The casino was nice plenty of restaurants lots of people. But the room that we were given was just BLAH. The bathroom while loaded with amenities was not very clean. The bathtub looked like it was not clean the room did not smell clean. Horizontal surfaces needed a good cleaning. The hotel is in a good location right in the heart of the strip.
40,The Mirage is a unique Las Vegas resort. The must see/do is “The Beatles: Love” show. I’ve seen 3 Cirque du Soleil shows and this one is the best!    “Hard Rock International” recently bought The Mirage. I really hope they keep it mostly the same. Please keep the Beatles show; as well as the beautiful indoor gardens and outdoor entrance.    The guest rooms especially the bathrooms need some upgrading. I hope the old tub/showers get replaced with a nice standing shower (for example).    Overall The Mirage is a great Vegas resort and I hope that Hard Rock maintains the Mirage’s charm.    If I find out that the charm is gone I will not stay there again. If the charm stays I will happily return.
10,Caution when paying the resort fee and deposit. They charged us as one giant resort fee instead of a free and deposit. First time we called they lied and said they sent it. Second attempt they admitted fault and refunded us an incorrect amount with a blank receipt emailed. I recommend MGM Grand as a better alternative.
30,Stayed here for the CES Conference. It was a good location to all the Venues and transfers to the convention center. Close to the Venetian Fashion Mall Caesars and lots of restaurants.    The rooms have no tea/coffee making facilities. There is no fridge for use. The fridge is locked and you need to ask the front desk to unlock but you can not remove anything as you will be charged.    The room was not clean. The carpets were extremely dusty in the corners with the same bits of crumbs on the floor the whole time we were there.    Housekeeping did not change the sheets for 3 days even though there was a major stain on them. After calling housekeeping they just remade the bed again. Told them to change it and then they finally did but came 3 hours later to do it just when we came back to sleep. Very disappointing.    There is no consistency in the procedures.    The bed was comfortable. The rest of the room was good.    Staff were ok but could be friendlier.
10,The Mirage used to be one of my favourite hotels. Since being purchased by Hard Rock it’s overall terrible. I was excited to see what Hard Rock would offer but I am extremely disappointed.    The Unity rewards program is an awful program so I wouldn’t recommend wasting your time or money at this hotel. The staff received so many complaints while we were there and they all just seemed deflated.    Mlife/MGM is overall a MUCH better program and hotel chain. They treat their customers right and appreciate your loyalty. If you are used to the MGM rewards program I highly recommend booking one of their other properties and passing on the Mirage.
50,I had a great stay at the Mirage hotel. The location is great! Right in the middle of all the action on the strip. The hotel is beautiful with lots of tropical foliage in the lobby and guest services area. We saw the Beatles love cirque de soleil show and it is was phenomenal! The pool is also large with a water fountain and there’s lots of seating around the pool area. It’s too bad that the Mirage will be be closing because I definitely would have returned to stay again!
30,My wife and I went to Las Vegas for 5 days over the Christmas holidays. We had not been since just before Covid (3 years). We stayed at the Mirage which had very nice rooms and decent restaurants. But the things that will keep us from going back are the number of people with dogs and kids. While we were on the casino floor gambling someone came through the casino with their mid sized dog. The dog squatted and defecated and urinated on the carpet. We also saw this at other casinos on the strip. And there are far too many kids all over the strip. In one casino a young boy had a screaming tantrum on the casino floor. We are not planning on ever going back to Vegas unless they ban dogs and discourage people from bringing their children. Really Disney is only another 5 hours West.
20,Stayed here 7 nights in an deluxe twin room.    Beds were comfortable. However pillows were of low quality given the price point and star rating of the hotel. (think HIX IBIS Hampton).    Pros:  - Good casino  - Good restaurants on site  - Gym was well equipped    Cons:  - Poor sound insulation from the hallway (nonexistent)  - Minibar is locked unless you call the guest services to come open it (not sure if this is standard in Vegas)  - Very crowded pool area no loungers available  - Limited opening hours for the fitness room. Closed quite early think it was already at 8 pm.  - Sauna and steam rooms were not warm enough.    The price was about 320 USD per night including taxes and resort fee. Would come back if half the price.
50,We stayed at the Mirage for 4 days in November 2022 celebrating our honeymoon.  It was my 2nd visit to Vegas and my husbands first time.    This trip was nothing short of amazing. The check in was a breeze and the lady at the front counter was so lovely and personable. She gave us an upgraded room with a lovely view on the 25th floor. It had a huge bathroom very comfy king bed and great closet/storage for clothes. The bell hop boys were kind and quick and the signature hotel scent was very nice. We didn’t get around to using the pools or gym but we did peek at they looked fabulous and open year round!    The location couldn’t get any better. Central to all and we loved exploring all the other hotels surrounding. We didn’t eat at the property but we did a bit of gambling and being non smokers found it quite tough to sit for along time due to the cigarette/cigar stench. To be expected when in Vegas!!    We loved the volcano show the short walk to señor frogs next door at TI and just the opportunity to stay here before it becomes a hard rock.    10/10!  Well worth the money
10,"The Mirage now owned by Hard Rock...They were great when under MGM management. Since Hard Rock took over on 12/19/22.....it is beyond terrible!! They give you no respect and or comps and tell you their system is down... repeatedly!!! It's awful. Stay with MGM don't bother wasting your time with them. Complete waste of your time until ""we get our system figured out"" Bottom line avoid at all costs. Just a disaster there."
30,My sister and I arrived Dec. 20 2022. Hard Rock had just taken over. Not much was working properly. Desk clerk was unable to find our reservation at first. We got checked in and went to the room. The room was very clean and comfortable. We went to the new rewards desk to receive our new players cards. They did match my tier credit with MGM (good for 60 days) and gave me $50 in free play but the system was not working and the free play never was credited to my account. During our first day our flight home was cancelled. I went to the front desk to inquire about extending my stay. They said their system was down and they were unable to extend my stay. I got on my Caesars app and had a room at Flamingo within 2 minutes. They did give me $50 in food voucher to cover the $50 resort credit from my original reservation though MGM. I have stayed exclusively at The Mirage for years but after checking Hard Rocks rates I will be moving back to Caesars properties. So long Mirage!
20,Terrible Hard Rock Management! This Casino and Hotel was acquired by Hard Rock Management from MGM. Negative Customer service and rude management! We don’t plan to return. I used to be a repeat Customer.  1. Booked through AMEX Platinum which usually gets us room upgrades and spending credits. We enjoyed this every time before.  2. This time around just after Hatd Rock Management took it over upon checkin they had a wrong rate so took a while to resolve that. Then they said they don’t upgrade with Amex Platinum. Then when I showed them written stuff they said none were available but I could upgrade if I paid extra.  2. So I asked for the Nanager who said he could not upgrade but would give a $200/- credit for each of the two rooms.  3. The morning of the checkout I went to check at front desk how much credit we had used and the front desk person (Jesus) told us that we did not have any credit. Then upon insisting he told us we had $100/- per room and not $200/per room so I asked for manager who promptly just repeated the same to us. So I asked to speak to the manager who checked us in. So then all of a sudden they found the notes in their computer about the $200/per room credit -:) so I asked his name to ensure I could refer to him if there were further problems at check out.  4. Sure enough at checkout same repeat story about no credits etc. and then they found it. Unfortunately he charged me $83/- extra on top of the resort fees which the only amount due at checkout. Fortunately my wife caught that when o went back so had to stand in line again to get that refunded but that took another 30 min of mind numbing discussion.  5. Then they tell us that the Room charge for the credit for breakfast has to occur before checkout time or else they will not give us the credit so I requested a delayed charge for breakfast after checking out on time at 11am. They said just no to everything and tried to make it as difficult as possible for us NOT to be able to avail the credit!  7. Most of the management staff at front desk were real rude and have no concept of Customer Service and are under pressure from the new Hard Rock Management.  8. Audrey from France was the only front desk person who was wonderful polite and genuine in his attitude! Go Audrey! He was the total opposite of the rude Jesus!    All in all a terrible experience so do not plan to return!
30,We were here with our family Dec. 25 to 30. The hotel is changing owners from MGM to Gard Rock. As a result lot of systems (TV checking out) were not working properly or at all. Also many of the restaurants never opened our whole time and the others had long waits. Not a bad place to stay but going through transition issues right now.
20,Got here at 3. Paid for a suite with two rooms. Door between two rooms locked. Sat on hold 35 minutes waiting for front desk to answer. Finally went down and was assured housekeeping would unlock it shortly. Seven hours later I wait on hold another 10 minutes and had to walk back down again to complain. Took a manager to finally handle it.    AC is terrible. TVs old and barely work. Have to hold remote up to like 4 feet from tv. Needs better management and update to interior.
20,We decided this year we bring our whole family here for Xmas and new year and birthday we thought we choose different hotel as we usually stay at Vdara hotel we love we thought we move a bit up because of kids but turn out to be the worst decision ever room got no simple equipment like kettle or coffee maker minibar locked every morning I have to spend 30 min on phone to make sure I get my room cleaned there was a day when I called 4 times and by midnight I gave up no room clean no clean towel and toilet tissue . My kids had to air dry after shower I have to wash glades my self as they don’t clean and put rubbish outside the room because it’s just piled up … we had upgraded room paid for 7 of us £17000 and this is what I get for it … shocking 😤 I have to strip bed my self
20,The Mirage Hotel has just been acquired by the Hard Rock Cafe chain. We have been visiting this hotel for over 25 years and we are very disappointed and disillusioned with the experience. No appreciation for customer loyalty.
50,My husband and I stayed at this hotel for the weekend. The room was spacious modern and clean. The hotel itself was very nice too and has many shops. We went to Shin Lim magic show and Cirque du Soleil there. Highly recommend!
20,"Within minutes of arrival my room was charged for items on the counter. No prices anywhere....don't believe the signage that states do not remove. We did not remove from tray but slid the items to the side within the tray looking for prices. We were also disrupted not once but twice by staff before the 11:00 check out time trying to say we had an ""expedited departure!"" With so many options to stay in Vegas choose elsewhere and walk to see the volcano."
20,Very poor service! You can’t use the fridge! It is packed with a bunch of food and you can’t take it out to us it. If you do you will be charged no question. I asked for another fridge to put my food and they were going to charge an additional $35 per night. I asked for extra ice buckets and I could not have more an 2. Very disappointed in this hotel.
40,A bit dated needs renovations but am sure MGM held off since Hard Rock acquiring and am sure will spend big $. My best friend is part of Seminole tribe they owe Jim Allen big kudos smart guy. Can’t beat the location of this hotel in the strip and the entertainment in the hotel is top notch.
30,As long as things didn’t go wrong or you didn’t need anything abnormal (like a fridge for medication) the stay was OK.    Very unfriendly to families. MGM rewards was more stress than help. The floors in the room were also disgusting.
50,Overall the hotel was clean staff exhibited courtesy prices were fair restaurants around were wonderful and parking garage was attached to the building making traversing back and forth easy. Will definitely stay again.
30,My room wasn’t close to the elevator. There was a party going on my floor and people were hanging out in the halls. My room was okay until  I opened the curtains and cracker crumbs were on the floor. The room was just ok.
30,Of all the places we went into on the strip this place was at the bottom of the list. The décor is too busy. The accommodations are average. I would rate it lower but the staff was very courteous and helpful. For instance our first room wasn't even cleaned (turned over) so we had to go back downstairs to get another. Staff was very helpful apologetic and waived our resort fees. If not for the staff this place is a 2 out of 5 for a rating.
40,Professional and friendly staff. Great amenities. However it would be nice to have a refrigerator and/microwave vs. a mini bar.    The holiday decor was amazing. It was disturbing that most of the hotel restaurants close at 10 pm. There were casual dining options available after 10 pm but was looking for a restaurant that was more upscale
40,The mirage was a great place to stay with easy access to our job site. Booked 4 rooms for the week with only a few hiccups. Great restaurant choices. Rooms were very nice and housekeeping was definitely on their game.
40,We stayed at the Mirage because we are MGM Loyalty members. We were attending an event at the Venetian and the Mirage was very convenient. We had a great dinner at the Heritage Steakhouse. The food dining room design and our wait staff were excellent. The first hostess at the stand was a bit rude but the other hostess was very accommodating. Upon check-in the front desk team recommended the two bedroom suite which was a great room for the family. It was very large and had a great living and dining area. The Starbucks in the hotel was very busy but was the most efficient Starbucks I’d ever been to. They were very professional and pleasant. I also played at the Blackjack table and the dealer was patient and kind even though I was a novice player. It was overall a great trip!
50,We were two couples celebrating our 40th anniversaries. We had an overall great time. The Mirage was a great choice for us. We had a memorable time. We took in a show spent time in the restaurants and bars. I wish we would have spent less at the gaming tables and slots.
50,Haven't been to Vegas in 10yrs so it was definitely a great experience. The volcano show was also nice to see at night with all the lights lit up. I highly recommend booking a room here if u do it in advance.
40,Would definelately stay there again. This was my 3rd stay at the Mirage. Some slots were really tight. Won most of our money on one machine. Don't mind loosing but you should get a little entertainment for your dollar. Lots of extra fees added to the advertised price.
40,Room was nice and clean. The bed was very hard and uncomfortable. The staff was also very nice. There was a small issue with checking in but they resolved it and gave me a $50 credit for food and drinks
50,Sigh - the Mirage becomes Hard Rock after this weekend;  Let’s hope they keep the Secret Garden with all of its Amenities - and the overall atmosphere. And the volcano. Not hopeful though.  If I stay at the Hard Rock (Mirage) in the future if I risk it I will follow up with another review.
50,We really enjoyed our time at the Mirage. Getting to and from the airport with an Uber was easy. The staff was great and our room was clean. We will definitely look at staying there again!  We had so much fun!
30,The good: this is a grand old property whose lobby and common areas have been kept up. Great location on the Strip. There are 6 elevators to serve just 7 floors. The front grounds are attractive. The rooms are large and the beds comfy. There is a bathroom fan.  The bad: our toilet leaked onto the floor. The AC vent rattled. The bathtub is chipped. The towels are cheap. Doorslams and conversation in the hallway are very audible. You cant make coffee or tea in your room. The room feels a bit dated and even for Vegas (which has generally gotten way overpriced) is quite expensive. We won't stay here again but there are things to like here.
20,Matt Miles and Danny from the front desk need a course in customer service. They have no idea how to talk to others in a respectful manner. They talk over you and cut you off before you have a chance to even ask a question. The worst service I have ever encountered at any hotel/resort/casino.
40,well connected to many other places on the Strip. We went to the Beatles Love show and it was inside the casino great easy access and great show. rooms were clean and organized. [Beware the mini fridge in the room is EXTREMELY expensive ($10 for a diet coke) and it cannot be emptied to store your own food or drinks] the casino was fun and there were also good bars and food options inside. check-in/out process was easy and the bell desk was nice to store our luggage on our departure day while we continued to explore the casino and Strip.
30,Hotel was a bit pricey and was so busy I think they had some cheerleading completion going on so many kids wondering around the casino restaurants so packed elevator time is so long the only positive was the quick and easy contactless check in make sure you take your pillow I couldn’t sleep neither my company
40,Decent hotel friendly staff Good food. Game play was good win some loose some. Hotel rooms were good. Just need to make a better curtain to black out the room. Strip view from the room was awesome. My only complaint was the sushi restaurant was a little over kill on trying to be fancy. The food was excellent tasting but left you Hungary. Let’s just say it was the most expensive snack I’ve ever purchased. I’m all about paying for quality food but when it all comes out snack size smaller then a McDonald’s kids meal with the appetizer and the entree combined. Let’s just say me and my wife left hungry for around $200. My wife dose not eat much. I’ll never go back there again. But the rest of the mirage was great.
20,Arrival was fine. Room kind of dirty. Lots of dust on the carpet. The bath tub drain was corroded. Both phones in a small room didn't work so I could call for room service or ask the front desk for help. My daughter loved a refreshment item where my cc had an immediate hold. I was told I wouldn't be charged. I was and have no item to show for it.
40,Very nice stay had a view of the strip just wish the room didn't have the water damage everything other than that was amazing hope to be back once the hard rock puts there new building up it looks really neat
50,The hotel beds guarantee you an excellent night’s sleep. Most comfortable ever. Staff is super friendly. We had a great time seeing shows as well. We enjoyed the food at OTORO Stack California Pizza and Heritage Steak House. The service was outstanding!
40,could dust room was nice but not happy that you couldn't visit guests you traveled with because on different floors and elevator average but not special i will not be back to this property unless a good deal
50,We always have had an excellent experience every time we have stayed at the Mirage. Housekeeping is always excellent and punctual. Dining options are great. We attended “LOVE” and really enjoyed the evening.
50,We visited for the NGWA convention. We had a great time seeing the shows eating fine dining at restaurants and gambling. It was also a good time meeting other ground water professionals at the convention.
30,No coffee pot no fridge no sofa. Beyond basic room. Expensive restaurants. $20 for a luggage rack because you can't load it yourself. I will say the staff was very friendly and accommodating. Room keys on phone didn't work.
10,"When I arrived the room was filthy. Not vacuumed. Middle table between beds not wiped and was sticky and crusty (sticky crystals spilled all around the night stand). Garbage under the dresser. Urine down the side of the toilet. Sauce splattered down the cabinets. (We arrived earlier than expected and they moved us to a room that was ""ready."") I called the front desk once we got in our room and asked if we could have our original room and that we did not mind waiting as we would prefer a higher floor and the room was filthy. She said not possible to change rooms but would send cleaning staff as soon as possible. No cleaner ever came so I went to the front desk with photos and of the dirty room. The man told me someone would be coming to clean. Again no one ever came and we spent the night thinking we were sleeping in someone else's filth. I was with my daughter for a cheer competition and I was mortified as I did not want to get kicked out on the streets of Vegas with my 12 year old for complaining again."
40,Complete screwup on my reservation of three rooms. Provided my confirmation number & pass code. Mirage said “we have no record of that reservation.” I’ve spent two hours (and counting) trying to fix this.  No refrigerator in the room for guest use.  I canceled a return trip slated for January 2023.  I’ll look elsewhere and not book through SWA for rooms again.  So very frustrating
30,The hotel is very large my biggest complaint is the casino servicing and the lack of cocktail waitresses compared to gamblers. also most of the pool was shut down and open odd hours that aren't very luxurious.
10,My 10 year old daughter found a used Dildo in the drawer of our room. The hotel in my opinion didn't do enough to correct the situation for our stay. We were required to stay there for our cheer comp held by Varsity..
40,Overall a great time at the Mirage. The one thing I regret is not asking to have a room close to the elevators. I am 69 years young and ha ve bad knees. I was put much to far away from the elevators. The food was great and lots of entertainment. Casino was good as well
20,No coffee pot or refrigerator in the room without an additional charge. The ceiling in the bathroom was gross and the carpet was dirty around the edges. The restaurants in the hotel are very over priced for the quality of food they provide.
40,Overall great location to everything. Parking was a little mad but we got parking when needed. All the workers were friendly and the front desk fixed a mistake that the app automatically charged early check-in
10,This hotel is definitely in need of revamping. Housekeeping was very nice but the room smelled of smoke and the shower fan did not eliminate any moisture from the shower leaving the room smelling moldy. The hotel restaurants could not handle the volume of guests and were extremely slow.
50,"I've been coming to Las Vegas since the early 90's and have stayed at quite a few over the past 30 years due to my employment booking many of those trips. However when given the opportunity I always requested the Mirage. A few things have changed since my last visit back in 2012 but overall the Mirage has maintained its standard of excellence. Food prices have skyrocketed and it put a nasty dent in my gambling funds & our stay was Sunday December 4th till Wednesday the 7th so Vegas was ""dark"" for our entire trip & the main reason for coming out was to catch Aerosmith live at MGM & we found out shortly arriving that the concert was canceled due to illness but thanks to our stay at the Mirage we thoroughly enjoyed our trip despite the initial disappointment. Truly hope Hard Rock doesn't adversely change my favorite hotel on the Strip the Mirage"
50,Our room was very clean. NO SMOKE SMELL AT ALL!!! Every staff member we dealt with was very knowledgeable and helpful. Starbucks accepts stars to redeem for coffee etc. Self parking is close to guest elevators.
30,Room was overall nice but bathtub was clogged chipped/worn bathtub someone’s old socks left in bathroom no outlets even remotely close to bed very limited family friendly services. No coffee makers. Had to wait 40 min in line for an $7 coffee. All restaurants are high end. $200+ to feed a family of 4. Lots of hidden fees. $150/night ended up almost $800 for 3 nights.
30,The bathrooms in the rooms are dirty. The bed was really hard in the stay well room. You hear doors slamming and people all night long. Go see the Beatles Love show was worth the money!! The whole family loved the show
50,One would think the level of service and attentiveness would be less than average given the upcoming transition to Hard Rock. Nothing could be further from that assumption! I would rank this as one of the best Casino/ Hotel experiences I have ever had. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive (from the front desk casino restaurants and support staff to the checkout and bell staff! Thank you Mirage/Hard Rock for a great
50,Visited for a work type event. Loved the hotel and the rooms. Restaurants bars and casino were great. Everyone was so courteous and helpful. The tub in the room was basic for what it was but everything else was lovely.
30,"The casino floor is attractive plenty of games but it can be hard to find a server. Our room for this business trip was quite expensive due to the rodeo being in town and then a cheer competition right after. Housekeeping definitely did not meet expectations but all other departments had friendly and helpful staff. I would recommend staying in the ""off"" season"
50,Came here for my daughter’s cheer competition and was blown away by how family orientated this place is. Normally you Dont bring kids to vegas but when you do id recommend this place. Great service and environment.
20,If you go here with your significant other know you both can’t be in the bathroom at the same time. Door hits you if on the toilet. Door hits you if you got Out of the shower and someone walks in.    You don’t have access to the fridge. It’s for the food and drinks they want you to purchase.    Place needs some upgrades and has seen its years of use.    The early departure fee was a joke when it was paid for the next night already. Get that extra money from you that you don’t spend in the casino.
20,Staff was very friendly but the make sure you ask if they will be doing construction above the spa before booking we had to listen to banging the entire massage. The bell hop took almost 4 hours to bring our bags to our room which was extremely frustrating because we had been traveling for over 12 hours.
50,Everything was perfect from check-in housekeeping meals at the Still and the Pantry and check-out. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The hotel was decorated beautifully. We didn't win any money but it was a wonderful stay. Sad that it is going away.
50,Friendly and informative staff. Helped with game play. Our Room was always clean and ready when we arrived. Overall the staff was great. Wish they had the buffet eating open again. That breakfast was the best.
50,Awesome time at the Mirage. We upgraded to a presidential suite for a fixed price. Was too good not to upgrade since we were staying there for a week. The suite was huge but you can see that it needed renovations. Very visible wear and tear. Electric curtains were mostly broken.    We usually stay at Delano but since this hotel was bought our by Hardrock we came to enjoy the pool volcano and the animals. Volcano show was great as ever. Kids loved it. Sad it would be gone. Pool was jam packed. People everywhere. It took me 30 min to get chairs and there was no more reservation for any cabana or chairs. The animals were so sad. Very lethargic due to the heat. They were just outside in the 105+ temperature. Glad they are getting rid of this and hoping the animals go to a better place.
10,Not sure if this going to help the next guest. Terrible Drink service 30 min wait. Food was way over priced. The pantry for breakfast for 4 $80 The still lunch for 2 no drinks $45 Rhumbar 6 people 2 buckets old beer wings tater tots one order of each $278.00    Now the real issue M Lige Comps we’re reduced down. GUEST BEWARE
20,Hotel is beautiful but they refuse to let you control the air conditioning in your room. It’s eco friendly! So when you are not moving in you room it shuts off according to front desk person. I will have to stay some other place next time.
50,Very fun place to stay. Friendly staff and super helpful. Would recommend to anyone. Always enjoy staying here. This is my 8th time staying there. Hope to stay again soon. Makes for a relaxing and happy trip
20,This property is worn since Steve Wynn created it. I hear that it has been bought out by Hard Rock. No maintenance or upgrades have been going on. The overall general attitude of the employees is indifference. They seem to be just warm bodies. Sad.
20,Black mold on the ceiling in our bathroom. Can't even use the fridge. Can't even make your own coffee all so they can charge outrageous prices for everything. Almost no floor service although the staff available was exceptionally helpful and friendly.
20,The bathroom part around the shower had noticeable dirty spots to think about. We never had the staff clean our room while we were there. The rooms at the NYNY are way better than these. I love the Delano and decided to stay at the Mirage which doesn't come close to Delano. I would compare the Mirage closer to the Excalibur hotel
50,Mirage is great and nice and clean. Recommend to theta. Will come back someday and enjoy all Vegas has to offer. But first I need to get finished with review. 200 characters is a lot to have to use up.
50,Great hotel and staff at the Mirage Hotel & Casino. I wish the hotel room had a mini refrigerator and possibly a microwave in it. I’d say take out the little mini bar and mini bar refrigerator items and let the guest use it for free.
20,No coffee maker they charge to use a fridge in your room and there was no blanket on the bed. All these are standard amenities in every room I have ever stayed in before. These guys are cheap and they charge enormous amount for sub standard accommodations.
50,The mirage staff all go the extra mile to make sure we have a great experience from the VIP treatment to the lounges restaurants table games etc.. I would highly recommend the mirage if your planning a trip to vegas!
40,It was a nice place clean friendly staff. The only thing that was disappointing is there wasn’t a coffee maker and the fridge is stocked full of Mirage products that if you touch lift up you have to pay for it. And there was no place for us to store out drinks to in the mini fridge
30,Woke up first morning with excruciating neck pain due to bad pillow provided by the resort and I was in excruciating pain the entire 5 days. I was not able to sleep for all four nights due to the pain on the neck. Please call me I will recommend the best pillow for your resorts
50,You can always count on a nice stay and have a great time. Mirage has everything you need to enjoy your trip in Las Vegas. Located on the main strip and offers a great location. You don’t need a rental car everything in walking distance
50,Great location very clean and well maintained knowledgeable and very help full staff in the casino The Pantry restaurant in the lobby became the breakfast to go place every morning everyone was very courteous overall a great experience.
10,"The first night we were there we had no A/C. Informed front desk and they said maintenance would take a look. Another night with no A/C but this time we woke up to and extremely wet floor and suitcase bottom (A/C Leaking). Again informed the front desk and they said lets switch your room but the room would not be ready for a while and they would call/text when it was available. I informed the front desk that we were fixing to start our day and could we come back later to switch rooms to which the replied ""absolutely"". Well we got the text that our room was ready and that we needed to switch rooms. We were told now that because the room was reported with a problem room service would assume the luggage was abandoned and take it to lost and found. So had to return to hotel to switch rooms. Upon leaving I informed desk clerk of our problems and said that he would issue a $100 credit toward the room. Really not even the price of one night and we sweated for two had soaking wet clothes and socks and had to cut short our day to switch rooms. I know this will not be an MGM hotel for musch longer but bad taste in my mouth for any MGM resort"
50,We love staying at the Mirage because it's home to Rodeo Vegas with KC Jones and his group. The addition of Teton Ridge made the trip even better. Love getting to hang out and reconnect with old rodeo friends from across the country at the watch party and concert every night.
50,Rooms are showing wear but the overall experience coupled with the great location makes this place a winner! Hard Rock has purchased so we will see what happens to it now. The Mirage was the starting mega hotel/resort in the late 80s that all others had to follow… sad to see it changing hands and ending its run on the Strip😎
30,The property itself changes from MGM Resorts to Hard Rock on December 19. You could sense that the hotel isn't up to the regular standards of a MGM property though the transition hasn't happened yet. This were a bit off (on a different night I saw LOVE so I saw the property twice). While the Rodeo events were going inside which gave it more of a vibe it needed more of a spark like it used to have. The staff was friendly but not on top of their game it felt like. Change is coming sadly the Volcano is a goner probably after New Year's and we will see the new direction of the property very soon. This was the first mega resort in Vegas that sparked the boom for everything else. I wish it had a better exit but maybe it will with HRH.
50,A couple minor issues while checking in but nothing significant. Great view of mountains and part of the strip. Of course very close to all the action as well as convenience stores shopping and other attractions.
30,"The window seals in #17071 are dried up and let the air and noise in. As a consequence the inside temperature fluctuates depending on the weather outside the comfort setting do not change that - the draft is stronger.  On of the elevator buttons on the 17 floor fell inside the pane first - it doesn't work second- it is not safe.  No outlet in a closes proximity to beds the only one is hidden behind quite heavy cabinet.  There is a fridge in the room but guests are not allowed to use it as it stores ""goods"".  No complimentary water which is quite strange your guests are arriving day and night - I believe the MGM Mirage can probably give 0.3 water bottle to guests at the registration desk.  After I checked out I realized that I forgot my charging cable but I wasn't able get it back the room service ""went for the lunch"". It is ok to eat I just never realized that my cable should accompany room service staff during the lunch.  That cable was something of importance and sentiment to me take it as my little fad but I really do not understand what kept room service from unload the forgotten items to the desk prior leaving the hotel."
10,No coffee maker and if you want a fridge you pay either a flat fee of $50 or $35 a day depending which way you go about getting one. There are no blankets in the room and no extra pillows like so many other places. You can get them if you ask but why should I have to ask for something like that. Why should I have to ask for anything above at the rates they charge for this place. I guess I should not have assumed that simple common amenities would be included.
50,Chad in VIP made us feel like rockstars after convincing us to switch from another property. We enjoyed gambling on property. We loved the craps tables. The Pantry breakfast place was excellent as well.
30,Rooms need updates and fixing  Changes to table chips amounts not friendly anymore  The prices for everything increasing including the minimum dollar for chips at the tables.  Waitress could never be found when needed
40,My husband and I stayed at this hotel from November 16-21. We found our stay to be quite enjoyable. We stayed in a king room with a volcano view. We found our room to be spacious and the beds were comfortable. There was no body wash provided so if you don’t want to wash with a bar of soap consider bringing your own body wash.  The location is great as it is central on the strip.  We found that all interactions with staff were positive and we found them to be helpful with any issues we had. Housekeeping had our room cleaned by late morning or early afternoon everyday.  Not a super fancy resort but a comfortable place to stay. We would certainly not hesitate to rebook here.
30,"Place is a bit dated. Maybe Hard Rock will update. Lots of noises in the room but the beds are comfortable. I did enjoy the volcano show but not from my room so don't bother paying extra for a ""viewing"" room it's just not worth it."
40,Great hotel to consider for your Las Vegas trip.  Great location walking distance to main attractions dining shopping closed to other venues like Venetian Bellagio Caesar Place  The room is clean quiet and spacious. Room service was fabulous…world-class service.  Friendly staff
50,Best location really near the re: Invent 2023 venue at the Venetian good spot on the Strip to visit everything big room with a desk perfect to work quiet quick elevator nice ambiance not too crowded.
40,As a technology driven society we have become accustomed to having usb ports in rooms my room had none.    Also as a business traveler I’m accustomed to having a coffee machine as well as a microwave in my room and mine didn’t have either.  The bathroom door has a 1/2” space to the toilet.. poorly designed and could benefit from a pocket door to allow a little extra space.  The mattresses need to be replaced they are sagging and uncomfortable.
50,Staff pleasant clean hotel through and through beautiful location. Only one minor problem was tiger garden had no accessibility during the trip but that did not take away from the wonderful experience and great amenities the hotel has to offer.
50,I have stayed at the Mirage at time or two before and I like that it is always consistent. The atmosphere of the casino the Pantry the 24 hour restaurant the pool still open in November and all the other shops. The location being so close to other casinos is great too.
30,I left my earrings (gold with red pearl) on the dresser & couldn't find it the next day & after. Did not report it because it's my words against theirs & for not locking them in the safe. I didn't lock because I had the do not disturb sign at the door for my entire six-night stay.
50,Mirage is an awesome resort! Professional staff and very clean. Love the location and it has the best smell.  Also has great restaurants we loved Stack.  Pool is nice !!!!  Husband loves the sports book as it’s one of the best in the strip.
30,We had a nice drive to the Hotel. Found the self-parking. Found the check in the Girl helping us was very calm and attentive! I asked fora room with a view. She looked around and spoke she had good news  A view of the Volcano. We didn't see! Later found out from a Bartender the Mirage was sold to the Hard Rock Cafe.
50,You have a casino host that was new to me. his name is Donald Presser. He did a fantastic job from beginning to end. you are lucky to have him in your employ. He is definitely an asset to your brand.    He was able to get us one of the suites and we were able to entertain our other friends from Florida and also have breakfast in the room overlooking the strip each day. Just a wonderful experience -all the way around and the hotel room was clean and we felt very welcome. the video poker machines were not as giving as in the past but we enjoyed ourselves non the less. thank you  mirage and Donald presser for a job well done.
50,Had a great stay. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Room was huge and great view. Our daughter loved the TV that came out of the bed ha ha. Great location on the strip and was awesome to stay at same property where we were going to Beatles Cirque de Soleil. Really enjoyed the show as well.
50,The room was clean and there were many good places to eat. We also enjoy the casino experience and the comedian. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary I’m very glad we chose the Mirage. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends who are planning a visit to Las Vegas!
40,This is a great hotel in a very convenient location at the strip. It doesn’t have its buffet open yet but it did had plenty of restaurants options (pricey though) Rooms are spacious and clean. It is a very comfortable hotel.
10,Will never stay here again. The room was dirty and dusty. Stains on the floor and furniture. I am surprised they have not figured out a way to charge you to shower and breathe while staying there. They charge for everything else.
50,It was my son's 9th birthday and we planned to visit Vegas to celebrate it. The front desk staff was excellent they help us to get great room with good view. All the staffs in hotel are very kind and respectful. I loved the pool and Hot water tub though it was little chilly in morning but the pool water was warm and to add on the Front desk staff gave us complimentary food voucher for my son on his birthday. Thank you Mirage for such great hospitality. Would definitely recommend this hotel.
40,I wasn’t informed about the 200.00 deposit for amenities I asked about it and was told it’s basically a deposit for if you drink or snack from the mini bar. I was told “don’t touch the minibar and you will be fine.” It’s been over a week and I still haven’t had it reimbursed to my account. I suggest to pay that fee in cash maybe so you get it at checkout if at all. (But I obviously only took enough cash for other things since ATM fees are 9 bucks!!!)
50,Our family went for Thanksgiving. The concierge Glenn was fabulous! He gave us recommendation on the shows and was very helpful! We got put in line for a room upgrade for a charge and it was the best decision ever. I still had to work so I needed room for my laptop and printer. With the upgrade there was room for the family to relax and watch TV. Best Relaxing vacation ever. Also the gelato by the elevators was a daily visit! :)
20,My room had a leak. I called the front desk and the lady was annoyed that I called and was very short with me. She said someone would come fix it and no one ever showed up. We didn’t get a different room or any follow up.
50,As I said overall experience was great and the only thing that would stop us from coming back are the small fees that add up. We got 2 rooms so we paid 2X the resort fees $200 deposit. They tried charging us $18 for parking because valet was $50. I called the parking phone from the garage and person on the phone was extremely rude. She kept cutting me off with a louder tone when I was asking a question. I even told her to stop being rude I was not familiar with this process. African American female would not give me her name.
50,This property was well kept and the room was great! Excellent staff and multiple restaurants with great access and short waits . Excellent location on the strip with shorter walks to other casinos. Loved it
50,The Mirage was a wonderful stay. I would recommend it for families due to the wonderful scent it had as you walk in. No smoke smell at all. Rooms were spacious. Great casino vibes. Overall good customer service. And of course the Volcano show!
50,Great all around property centrally located friendly staff lots of meal options at fair prices. Bathrooms always clean signage is good for getting around and everything nicely laid out. Beatles show a must see kids loved it.
40,The check-in and check-out process is great. The bathroom is a little small but room overall is big. Housekeeping very nice and attentive. The MGM rewards when booking a room are awesome! I would stay here again and recommend to a friend.
50,We love staying at the Mirage! Great experience and customer service every time! Great location - walking distance to many places and activities. Rooms are updated and clean. Delicious food options within the hotel.
50,The Mirage is the best value for your money on the strip. Clean rooms comfortable beds and great location to really anything. I hope the change to Hard Rock doesn’t change any of that… The Mirage is my go to hotel.
40,I stayed at this hotel twice with my family when we went to Vegas. I just went to Vegas a couple weeks ago again but stayed at the MGM hotel instead to be honest the Mirage puts it to shame. I definitely plan on staying at the Mirage during my next trip to Vegas. My dad always says he will only stay at this hotel whenever he goes back and to be honest I don’t blame him. The Margie may not be the biggest hotel on the strip but it is one of the best and has everything you need. The hotel has an amazing coconut smell that is out of this world but the best part about this hotel is the pool. And I would strongly recommend anyone reading this review who plans on going to Vegas to stay at the mirage because you definitely get the most bang for your buck at this place.
40,The front desk is way too far from the elevators and you have to roll your luggage through the carpeted casino to get to them. A tiled walkway would be so much nicer. Also time to phase out smoking in the casino like some other MGM properties. If you arrive on a Tuesday be prepared for most of the restaurants to close early or not be open at all. Our room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. Curious to what changes are coming when it turns into a Hard Rock.
50,It was a great stay for me and my family. Everything was clean and the Mirage family was kind helpful and courteous. It was a comfortable atmosphere and an overall great time for us. We learned some new games!
40,Our trip to Las Vegas was awesome. Staying at the Mirage is a great value and perfect location. Walking distance to restaurants and entertainment. Aces of comedy is a great value for an evening out. Room had a spectacular view of the strip and partial views of the desert. Beautiful grounds.
30,My vehicle was broken into and my property was stolen. The parking structure should be a secure place especially if you have to pay for parking. No one should have to deal with something like this when on vacation.
30,Unless you want to be blind sided by security because you weren’t being “obedient” to the mangers eyes then don’t go. Only reason why my family went was for the TVs they had for games otherwise the food and seating is average.
50,We had a great stay! Free strip view upgrade was especially appreciated! This is an awesome location on the strip. Very clean and helpful staff. I would highly recommend staying at the mirage. You can park for free if you rent a car with a pearl card at any mgm location. Helpful if you rent a car.
40,Beautiful room.we liked the convinces of the Cirque de sole Beatles’s Love. Being in the same hotel & the gift souvenir shop was great. We Liked having star bucks & California pizza kitchen in the hotel.
40,It was good very busy and the smoking was a major problem. Hard at times to get drinks while on the floor on the slots.  sports center was nice and the show out front was good.  that is all I can say at this time.
40,As an MGM Rewards member this was a good rate for a two queen room. The hotel room had ample space and basic appointments. The hotel had all the things you’d want in terms of restaurants entertainment and amenities. It’s next door to the Forum Shops and Caesars which was important since we were there for the weekend to see Adele. It’s only downfall like many Vegas hotels is the stench of smokiness. It’s significant in the casino area and even up into some of the floors of the rooms.
50,We had a blast at The Mirage. Our Tower Suite was HUGE. Large living room a dining room area and 2 bedrooms with very large bathrooms. The Beatles show was super cool and inexpensive.  Food was great. And the Betting room was so much fun. Lots of games on and all types of bets. The staff will explain betting to you.  Alot of nice things to do within walking distance. I will be going back for Christmas! See you there!!!!
10,Holes in sheets. Dirt on doors. Not enough shampoo and conditioner. TV didn’t work. Lumpy pillows. Requested room change. No assistance provided. Bad customer service. No thanks. Stay somewhere else’s
50,Wonderful Stay at The Mirage! The service the accommodations the hospitality was great! At check in the host allowed my grandson to join her behind the dest to get an up close and personal view of the huge fish and aquarium! It's the little things that make the difference.
50,My family finds the Mirage a great location with entertainment for all ages. Shin Lim is an amazing show. The hotel staff is top notch and the room and ambiance of the hotel is great. I recommend this place to anyone looking to enjoy the heart of the strip.
20,The first time we stay in the Mirage hotel and Casino but we are not satisfied as we think. We think this is a famous hotel in Las Vegas. Room is not clean and smell. The elevator is trouble in operating.
50,I booked to enjoy the Mirage before it's gone and the Volcano becomes a part of Las Vegas strip history. Heritage Steak and The Pantry are the highlights when staying or visiting the hotel and resort.
40,I've stayed at several MGM Resorts this was my 1st time at the Mirage quite surprised Hotel Restaurants Casino and hotel staff in all departments were very Professional and Pleasant. Had a great time I would highly recommend this Resort.
50,Amazing friendly staff. Quick check-in. Helpful housekeeping. Tower room is clean and nice view for volcano. Food is amazing at Tom restaurant. Staff nice at Pantry.  Only minus is after 2022 no more mgm point for Mirage No more volcano. No more jungle
50,This is a great place to stay once you get over the confusion of getting into the parkade and check in process. The rooms are clean comfortable and well maintained. Friendly staff check in was a little slow with only 2 agents and a long queue. The designated elevators for different floors works very well and much appreciated. Our room was quiet and spacious but towards the end of the hall a long walk to the elevator. It was a very comfortable stay. Would definitely recommend this hotel.
40,The hotel was amazing. Nice view perfect location on the strip and overall a beautiful hotel. I will say there was hair on towels in the shower & around the toilet when we first checked into our room which obviously weren’t ours but other than that no complaints. There is also a fee of $300 they take when you check in & only give back a little more than half due to resort fees & taxes which sucks but I my family & I enjoyed ourselves the hotel and the locations that this hotel was close to.
50,We stayed at the Mirage because the deal on Vegas.com was the best value. We also planned to see Love so it made it convenient. We spent most of our gaming time/$ there as well. The dealers were friendly and helpful. Overall - good trip!
50,The Mirage is one of the best hotels/casinos I have stayed/played in. The property is clean neat and feels safe. The staff I came in contact with were were friendly courteous and knowledgeable. The food was very good. All in all this was a very enjoyable 3 days.
30,This Hotel a few year ago probably would have been one of the best on the strip. The impression we got was that the hotel was trying to Nickel and Dime us at everything - there are no deals here. Guess they are trying to get as much as they can before the big sale to Hard Rock. Avoid pool drinks - crazy expensive. Mattress very firm. False advertising on Hotel TV about ticket discounts. No buffet. Friendly staff and very clean. Volcano display out front is not to be missed.
50,Lovely rooms and efficient professional staff made for a great vacay here. There is a good selection of restaurants as well. We enjoyed the desserts at the gelato counter. Gambling was good as anywhere.
50,Still a solid resort with experienced and friendly staff. Many entertainment options to choose from including table games slots and Beatles Love show. Rooms were exceptionally clean and cleaning staff very friendly.
20,I have been staying at the Mirage for over 20 years this year was the worst I have ever stayed. It is obvious that since the hotel is changing ownership some of the employees are just going thru the motions. From the time I checked in to eating at the Pantry I encountered some problems that I would never have had before. I guess I am going to have to find a new casino/hotel for the future.
10,Crap had $15 minimum. Room was clean and everywhere smelled good. Sportsbook was clean. I had no issues getting food charged to the room. I checked in at 2:30am with no issue . Check was easy. MGM rewards is well worth it
50,Great hotel choice of restaurants and cuisine ease of check in Love Cirque du Soleil was a fantastic show. Hotel staff was very accommodating when we asked for a late check out. We ate at Tom Colichio’s Heritage Steak And our meal was superb. Great overall wait staff.
30,The hotel itself is in a really good location on the strip. The rooms are average nothing that special and honestly I don’t think the “volcano” rooms are anything special. Disappointed that the hotel doesn’t have continental breakfast especially because they don’t allow you to use the fridge for personal use in your own room. I’d be curious to know how the other hotels in the area compare I do think the fees should be prorated especially during an off season when the pool/outdoor areas can rarely be used.
50,"There are a lot of wonderful places to stay while in Las Vegas. The Mirage is one of those places. Yes it can be a little pricey but you get a wonder experiance something that you can look back on and say to yourself ""I had a great time."""
50,I was impressed with the hotel it was better than I thought it would be and at a decent price. Staff was awesome and extra nice. I'd definitely stay again. I loves the location because you could walk to so much.
40,The room was clean spacious comfortable and lots of available elevators.  The facility is also super clean and does not look rundown. Easy access to the other hotels and Walgreens.  I just wished that the checkout has separate line or the TV checkout is user friendly.  Over all I would stay at The Mirage again.
50,The Mirage is always clean and the location and amenities can’t be beat. All the restaurants on property are excellent. The front desk staff always go above and beyond to help you. The casino area is always clean and well maintained. Fabulous property!!
40,The room was very nice and clean. The bed was comfortable the bathroom was very roomy for 2 and the desk with a charging station was great.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating and the housekeeping did a great job.  There are 2 items to be aware of:  There is only a mini bar in the room not a refrigerator so there is no room for water or leftovers.  Some of the restaurants close 2-3 days a week or are not open in the evening. The 24 hour room service hours have also changed to 7am - 8pm which we found out at 8:05pm when we got a received message announcing the change in hours.
50,The Mirage is everytime you would hope it would be and more! Sleep Well Rooms had the most comforting beds I have ever slept in. All restaurants have excellent food! BEATLES LOVE IS EVERYTHING! All staff from Bell Services Front Desk Concierge Taxi Line Housekeeping were phenomenal! The Mirage is beautiful inside and out! Volcano Show was fun from street view and from out our window. The Mirage is centrally located on the Vegas Strip so it makes getting anywhere easier.
50,The lobby was so beautifully decorated for Christmas! The front desk staff made me feel like a valued customer and was personable. Everyone was so nice. We felt safe at the hotel because lot's of security.
50,Thoroughly impressed with our stay and it would honestly be my go to but I hear it’s changing over to HardRock. My only small recommendation would be that I wish MGM had personal fridges like most Ceasars properties. Very clean and it smells delicious when you walk in!
40,The Mirage is a beautiful hotel located on the strip. It’s really close to great shopping and restaurants. The lobby/entrance offers many picture taking opportunities. I think the decor could use so updating. The Mirage has several different food options Starbucks California Pizza Kitchen and the Pantry just to name a few. The rooms are comfortable but the doors close loudly.
50,Had a nice FRIENDs vacation! Front desk accommodated us with adjoining rooms.  Gaming was FUN...  Ate at the Pantry for breakfast and Diablo for their pozole which is a must try there.  Everyone was friendly from the time we checked in til we checked out.
50,Nothing can beat the location center on Strip walking distance to major hotels restaurants and casinos. Easy check in and easier checkout. Dolphins exhibit is closed but nice heated pool and hot tub open.
50,Family gathering. Nice Christmas decor. The music in the casino was great. The housekeeping staff was very friendly. Enjoyed watching the volcano show at night. Disappointed that it will be taken down. Overall we would stay at the Mirage again.
40,The Mirage has a great location and great staff. Rooms were very nice and well-kept by the service staff. There is on-site car rental and a business center operated by FedEx. It was incredibly convenient wit great service. Just straight up Las Vegas hospitality at its finest. Sorry to see her be replaced by a Hard Rock but that's the way it is in Vegas.
50,After half a dozen stays in Vegas we finally booked Mirage and it was great! Essentials store located right by guest elevators was great! Study have to navigate thru casino traffic like most hotels. Staff is friendly and helpful!
50,Everything was impeccable. The only thing I didn't care for were the beds. I would rate them an Extra Extra Firm!! Not my choice for beds. Maybe the other rooms have different mattresses. Everything else about the room was great.
30,Downgrading my room instead of upgrading it due to the lack of maintenance done to your rooms at your hotel is a big negative.  You should always accommodate your customers and upgrade their stay when they are not at fault.
30,If you miss the hotels of the last century here's your chance to reconnect! No power outlets by the bed. Tired outdated decor rooms whose walls are so thin you can hear every word (and headboard banging pelvic thrust!) from next door. No coffee machines in the room. Seriously. Who does that? Nut allergy? All the toiletries have nuts in them. When they're not leaving you sleep or coffee deprived they're trying to kill you.
50,Stayed in a top floor suite. Price very acceptable for what I received. The rooms are nice and housekeeping is exceptional.I've stayed there many times and always return. I plan to go back in Jan. Not sure what changes the Hardrock will make.
40,There was decently proced rooms and they allowed us to stay on the same floor together. Good casino set up alot of table games and there were a large selection of restaurants to go to. Perfect for the strip. A little caught of guard with the 400 deposit charge but other than that it was a good place to go with friends.
50,We loved our stay at The Mirage. The staff was friendly and the hotel was easy to navigate. The hotel is well-cared for and has a beautiful exterior and interior plants/landscapes. Our room was spacious and quiet. We had a nice view of the Strip. Would definitely stay here again!
20,The room is very dated and the bathroom is very small. The mini refrigerator had dust buildup on the side and the shower head was so built up it looked like it was never wiped since installed. Also the room doors don't really block out any hallway sounds. We could hear everyones conversations all night while they walked down the hallway and all the doors seem to close loudly for some reason
50,Always great accommodations and service. Perfect location. We have always stayed at The Mirage and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Rewards program and promo offers have always been great! We’ll miss The Mirage!!!
40,Great location very clean. I don’t like how they stock the fridge and if anything moves in the fridge they want to try and charge you. Also paid to check in early and couldn’t check in . Would most likely stay there again due to the location
30,The Mirage feels a bit dated. But there was nothing wrong with it. Service and cleanliness were perfect. The ceiling height of the rooms is a little low for my taste. And there were no easily accessible power outlets near the bed. A bottle of coke at the convenience store of the hotel is $5.70. A water bottle from the mini bar is $18. You may not want to arrive there thirsty when you're traveling on a budget. And you wouldn't have chosen this hotel if you weren't traveling on a budget I guess.
40,From check in to check out it was an easy process and was not burdened with long wait times. Room was avail early and digital check in worked smoothly. The casino floor is not as large as other hotels so it is faster to get to your room. Clean and comfy room. Enjoyed my stay!
50,You can walk just about anywhere on the Strip from this location the Cirque show Love is wonderful see it while you can. Nice room. Very nice pool area although we didn't use it in November. Nice gaming facilities as well.
30,Booked a room but wasn’t available at 3pm and offered a lower grade room or wait until 5 pm. No other compensation was given . Bath tub didn’t drain well . There was homeless person right outside the lobby
20,Very misleading with the resort fees . Beds very hard . No fridge  coffee maker or microwave in room. Ac was very subpar as well. Customer service was just average nothing special at all . Food was okay . Very short pool hours .
20,Fly was in my food. Wait staff simply said o good lord and walked off. My coworker walked into her room after a long flight in the night to men partying in her room. Security removed them and she was expected to say in that room. They had food everywhere and had been in the bed. Issue was latter resolved. However she should have not ever been expected to stay in a room like that.
40,Nice room little out dated however nice view and comfortable bed. Variety of places to get a quick snack There a gelato shop down stairs that serve cakes and other tasty treats. There’s a Starbucks however some of the restaurants were very expensive.
10,Today while getting a massage at the MGM Mirage hotel in Las Vegas someone broke into two of our family members lockers and removed over $1400 (in large bills) from wallets. Upon discovery we immediately notified the spa attendant who contacted hotel security. Statements were provided now we will see how MGM responds.
50,Great location with easy access to dining and lots of entertainment close by. The pool is open year round which is rare for a resort on the strip.All the staff were friendly and accommodating. The hotel layout is also very nice.
20,I did not like my stay at this hotel. Rooms are outdated and dusty bathroom are not up to date. I got the view of a parking lot though I paid for strip view. I requested to change room in which that was denied. Don’t waste your money
40,Customer service treated us with the utmost respect. The Pantry restaurant was the best and worth the money. Stay Well rooms are clean and worth the cost. Tigers were not available to see. Lobby was clean.
20,"Our suite was ""not available"" upon arrival. We stayed at the Mirage 11/11/22 - 11/13/22. After being told that our suite was simply not available the front desk told us that they found a hospitality suite and it ended up being a 1 bedroom suite with a connecting room. So we went down again and this time they really found a hospitality suite for us but by God this room should not be available to guests. Check room 02046. The wallpaper still smells like smoke it's as if the room is from 20-30+ years ago without any upgrades or major cleanings. Everything was old and dirty. All of the managers were too busy to speak to us as there was a ""corporate call"" or something. All we want is to book a room and have it be available when we get there. It was 6pm by the time the room was available for us. In return Mirage offered us $450 in f&b credit and waived resort fees. Although a nice gesture when you're paying >$1k a night on rooms at a hotel there is a higher expectation of customer service. The Mirage should have one had a manager leave their corporate call to address this issue with us two have been upfront with us and explain why our room was not available maybe given to another guest. After a simple apology they should off comped us two nights in a suite for our next time out in Vegas to make it right. Why that because we effectively paid $1900 for 2 nights after f&b credit for a room that should be $1000 total at most. Will not stay at the Mirage again.    UPDATE (11/17/22): Received a call from the hotel manager who was very nice and apologized for the inconvenience. He comp'd us 1 nights stay plus the overage ~$150 that we spent on food and beverage."
30,This really does not matter as it soon will be Hard Rock Hotel. This is the one that started it all. Vegas mega resorts. Great service from everyone. Room nothing special. It falls short with food choices. You cannot get any kind of meal here for 2 people without breaking the bank. I spent less on lunch at Aria.
50,Great location and easy check in/ check out service. Hotel overall was clean and staff were very friendly. For how old it is the hotel is maintained immaculately. Plenty of restaurants and bars in the hotel compete with outside ones making it easy to grab a bite or a drink all in the comfort and convenience of the hotel. Definitely recommend.
40,The hotel staff was very nice in all areas. The room bathrooms are a bit dated but the rooms were large. This hotel is at a great location on the strip and provides a good value. Easy walk to a lot of other locations.
50,Great stay at this Hotel with family. Couldn’t fault anything all the staff were very pleasant and accommodating for any needs we had . The rooms were perfect and we were all put on the same floor which was much appreciated. I would like to mention Adrienne Plumber who went above and beyond in re-uniting me with my lost property overall a great stay and will definitely return to the Mirage.
20,Heard loud and roudy people coming back all night long in the hallways got zero sleep. No soundproofing in rooms whatsoever. Rooms are overall outdated lovely view of the roof/equipment. Traveled for business in Nov of 22.
50,Mirage has an easy access to the stripthe rooms were clean 👍elevators were easy to find and figure out food was close by and breakfast was available right out of the elevator which makes it easy being so tired after walking around in vegas!
40,Room and amenities were nice but showed a bit of wear and tear. Good location. Price was reasonable so a good value. Disappointed in the fitness center. Should open before 6am (many east coasters are up a lot earlier) and way too small for a hotel that size. It was ridiculously crowded.
50,Stayed here for the HLTH 2022 conference. Great value clean and exceeded my expectations. Great location on the strip. The Pantry is a good restaurant with many options for dining. The service was a little slow but the food was good and the prices reasonable for Vegas.
30,Rooms were Ok but small bathroom with a shower in the bath tub which is uncomfortable for any person of reasonable height. We thought the pantry had excellent selections and was quite tasty. Essentials were conveniently located within the hotel
10,I get Vegas hotels see a lot of traffic and can be gross. I was here for business travel and ended up staying in the “Stay Well” floor. It was definitely gimmicky overall but the biggest issue I have is seeing cockroaches every single day. Going to do a check of my clothes and bags before I go and when I get home. Just absolutely nasty.
50,Mirage is such a classic casino with friendly staff at all tables numerous choices for restaurants awesome Sportsbook bars and one of the best pools. They also have a super-expedited check in which allows you to do it on your phone and just skip the line. So sad that this property is being sold to Hard Rock. Not sure what the future holds in 2023.
40,Lovely room with not too far of a walk from elevator and elevators aren't too far from lobby. Maybe 8 minutes to walk from registration to room.  We arrived around midnight and only had to wait in line for about ten minutes before a very quick check in process.  When we arrived in our room the thermostat was not functioning. A guy from maintenance came up did what he could then called up two electricians. The three of them had it running within 20 minutes. They were so friendly that we didn't even mind the delay in getting to sleep.  Our room was very clean and cleaner every day. Excellent housekeeping. Bed was very comfortable but no outlets near the bed so we had to charge phones across the room.  The pool and its bar are fantastic  we spent the bulk of our three days in Vegas lounging at the pool. Even though it was November it was warm enough to enjoy. There is an outdoor hot tub for guests. It does not mention it on the Mirage website. If we'd known we would have brought swimsuits.  Check out was very easy as was luggage storage. Excellent and friendly staff.
40,Hotel staff are friendly and helpful.  Hotel location on the strip is perfect - walk or take the trams.  Variety of restaurants - luv California Pizza and the new sandwich place - gotta try their Philly Cheese Steak sandwich!  Ample room at the pools and hot tubs but get there early.  Variety of casino games. We like the slot machines - some are busier than others'.  Rooms are clean beds are super comfy but beginning to show their age and wear - stretched carpet.  Overall good value and amenities.
50,We visited the Mirage over twenty years ago and it is still as beautiful today as it was then. The property will change hands to the Hard Rock end of December. We wanted to stay one more time before all the rock paraphernalia took over. It’s continued charm and wariness makes us glad that we did.
50,My daughter and I went to Las Vegas for her to tour Unlv. We have stayed at several hotels on the strip in the past but she had not stayed at the mirage yet. Our room was nice and big. Easy parking. Good food choices and conveniently located towards middle of the strip.
20,Room had a lot of outside noise as others have mentioned here. Guest services were very unhelpful in general. As it’s changing from Mirage to Hard Rock some time soon i dont think this hotel is getting any love any more from management and is starting to fall apart.
50,Amazing experience in this unreal place. We loved every minute of it. Impressed and overwhelmed. Staff members are so nice. Hope we'll be back soon.    We want to give a special s/o to Shahidul Islam from retail at the 24/7 Essentials shop with whom we shared a great time at 3 o'clock in the morning. Great hardworking man with a lot of kindness and generosity made our stay really special with an unforgettable memory.
50,Friendly Staff clean rooms variety of great restaurants. The Still has the best wings!!!! Drinks are great and server are Friendly. Close to several restaurants hotels and shopping mall across the street. Great location and experience 👍
20,Upon entering the room we were initially assigned my girlfriend and I were met with the smell of stale vomit. It was the clear the hotel realized this was an issue as they had left the vent fan and window open to air it out. They did promptly put us in a new room but even the replacement had problems with humidity the shower not draining properly the window not opening properly and condensation forming on the window sill. Staff was great and friendly location is great but frankly the room just isn't worth the price point.
50,We lived our stay at the Mirage. The staff is friendly the rooms are clean and the Casino is fun! We will definitely be returning. Very centrally located which was very convenient. We will recommend the Mirage to everyone!
40,the hotel was clean the staff was friendly and helpful and the restaurants food was delicious. Our room was right over where the volcano is so was able to see it go off each night was great to see. Loved the hotel.
50,I’m a regular customer long ago good to be back. Good service and friendliness help me enjoy my trip  it why people go vacation  over all the whole casino see you with a smile when question create a peaceful joy
10,The hotel has seriously gone down. So many upgrades/renovations need to be made. Even the ground is not level inside of the hotel. Mirage was once my favorite hotel now it’s at the bottom of my list along with circus circus and luxor
10,Front desk likes to add on fees after being told you won’t be charged. They charged my credit card anyway. Also not very accommodating place. When asked for upgrade they said was sold out but yet another couple asked for upgrade and was given the upgrade. Not very truthful.
50,Rooms were very spacious clean  and very comfortable. Loved the quick mobile check in and check out which made it very convenient. The location of the hotel was great and close to all the places we wanted to go which was a big plus for me.
30,Outdated bathroom the paint was chipping and the shower was dirty. No microwaves or refrigerator in the room when I have two toddlers who require cold milk and snacks. Also I did not have a ice bucket whoch I needed due to the lack of a refrigerator.
10,Stay just about anywhere else on the strip or stay off the strip. This place is way too expensive for what you get - no fridge or microwave access in rooms parking is offensively expensive ($18/day) and the smells throughout the casino are rank. And I’m not just talking about the cigarettes although I do feel like my lungs aged by a year just by virtue of staying there. It becomes clear very quickly when staying here that they want to nickel and dime you for everything - from drinks to snacks to food you name it. The Starbucks on site alone has a $2 premium on all their beverages. The walk through the casino to the guest elevators from parking takes around 10 minutes and you’re met with crowds of people as you try to get bags through. The advertised speaker system in the room only works with an AUX cord and I have no idea who would be carrying an AUX cord on vacation. I assumed it would be Bluetooth. At the end of the stay I thought we were being overcharged and our discount for the room block hadn’t applied so I waited in line to talk to someone only to find it was a $44/day resort fee added to the bill that was the culprit. The fee was not up front when booking the room and I wasted time in line to talk to someone about it. I would recommend staying off strip at the Staybridge and I wish I would have cancelled my reservation after the first day and moved because that was all around the worst hotel I’ve ever stayed in. And that’s not even mentioning the rusty bathtub drain or 9 am housekeeping calls.
50,My wife and I took our first trip to Vegas ever and had an amazing time. The Mirage was an awesome place to stay. Great mix of older and younger crowd which provided a great experience. Rooms were nice and the hotel was kept very clean. Staff was extremely nice and helpful all the way down to the security guards. Would definitely recommend.
20,The Mirage is a terrible place to stay. The stained bathtub 24/7 sound of heavy equipment in the rooms and lack of any sense of care for either guests or the facility make it one of the least pleasant hotels I’ve stayed at in the recent past. Stepping off the dirty elevator to the guest floors you will be greeting with low ceilings and weird smells. Unfortunately the rooms will be downhill from there. The downstairs casino area here is quite nice so I don’t know why the guest rooms and associated service are so incredibly bad.
50,The room was gorgeous i booked a volcano view room and it was so nice. We were able to watch the volcano show from our room and didn't have much noise late at night. It was spacious and has some good eats in the downstairs area. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to have a comfortable stay on a budget. Only cons are no coffee pot and no fridge. What's in the fridge charges you if you move it so it was pretty useless. Otherwise had an amazing stay.
30,Bathroom was particularly unclean. The shower area was not great. The18th floor just seems a bit older but decent place to stay but not great. The mobile app check in was very easy to use and great way to skip lines.
50,This was by far the best trip. Everything went perfectly from the flights to the hotel stay. The hotel has everything you need to do in one spot if you don’t even want to leave. Staff were great free drinks while you play AMAZING!
40,Room was ok. No water or coffee provided as complimentary. Every hotel I stayed in always had coffee and water. Only in Vegas it was not. Casino was clean but smoky. Valet service was excellent. The car was available instantly upon arrival.
50,This was our 2nd trip back to the Mirage after 16 years later & still loved it! The rooms are well taken care of clean & comfortable! The property itself is clean & well kept lots of great choices of restaurants & fun things to do without even leaving. Even the parking garage is well kept - it’s clean well lit & plenty of spots.
40,Great overall experience. Perfect location and lots of restaurants nearby. Check In and Check Out process went smoothly. Rooms were nice and clean! Perfect place for all ages. Will consider this hotel and revisit again.
40,Overall my party was satisfied. I did have an issue with check in and my room not being available upon arrival or even after the agreed check in time. Other than that the stay and the hotel were great.
50,If you want to be pampered and be center strip .. The Mirage is the place to be . It will be changing soon but if they keep things simple and only change what the hard rock wants ..it will still be a great choice . So convenient and safe.
40,Still love the Mirage but the rooms could use a refresh. Beds are rather old and not that comfortable and the collection of pillows are awful. Good value for money though but I may chose to stay elsewhere next time.
50,Although it had been a few years since our last visit to the Mirage I instantly remembered the reasons for my fondness for the property upon entry. The hotel and grounds were beautiful the staff was warm and friendly our room was immaculate I felt like Nick Papagiorgio from Yuma. Super great experience all around!
20,Went for a fun Pbr weekend and we were so sad with the room. First the ac never gets the room cold it just keeps it kinda warm even at 62 degrees. The bathroom is so small I don’t understand why they made it that way. Never again
50,Our room was beautiful! We stayed on the 25th floor and had a view of the volcano every night! Housekeeping did a great job of cleaning our room every day while we were out. The hotel was very clean in general as well and the staff was so friendly. They were starting to decorate for Christmas as we were leaving and that was beautiful!
40,We chose the mirage as “middle of the group” for pricing. The hallways could use some updating. The window in our room wouldn’t stay open which would have been nice not a huge deal. The staff member at check in was very friendly and helpful. I wasn’t offered a single drink while gambling as I only saw 2 waitresses.
50,Just had a five night stay and all staff was extremely friendly. Food was good at all restaurants and lots of morning coffee places. The rooms casino and public restrooms were clean. I do miss the old 3-2 blackjack though.
50,Would encourage anyone to stay here. Beautiful welcoming staff and lobby. Rooms were great and very clean. So many good restaurants and all your needs easily taken care of. Awesome location on the strip.
30,Like I said it’s irritating that you have to hunt down coffee. Not having a coffee maker available is minor league. Not having access to a refrigerator is also a detriment. Cutting the little things hoping people don’t notice… I noticed and was inconvenienced.
50,Awesome location great service friendly staff. Always stay here and never had a bad experience. Central location is amazing. Love the pool and restaurants. Casino is top notch! I’ll definitely be back!
10,We were checked into a filthy room. There was food bottle caps and plastic wrappers covering the floor. Surfaces were not wiped down. We were given a new room and $150 compensation that could be used for food and drink at the Mirage restaurants. We paid for a room with a view of the Strip and got a new room without one. The staff had told us that we would immediately get access to our new room and the new floor with out old keys but they did not work. It also took us 2 hours to get checked in since we had to return to the front desk for new key cards. We also got charged for one of our dinners because they did not apply the credit to one of our meals. We almost paid an additional $85 and the only reason we weren't was because we caught it at check out. I genuinely do not think that the Mirage cares for its customers. If you decide to stay here please check your fees at check out and make sure that everything is correct.
50,This facility was clean well maintained and the staff provided great customer service. Not one thing was noted that was negative. If attending my conference next year at the Venetian I would most definitely stay at this resort again.
40,Book king size room Saturday to Tuesday Late arrival no problems with booking nor room clean room and friendly staff. close to everything on the strip. good last minute price as well . I would recommend in the future .
50,We thoroughly enjoyed our 4-day stay at the Mirage! Great places to eat & so many fun slots to play! The general location on the strip was convenient for us also. The greatest highlight was hitting a $840 bonus on a machine minutes before we had to head to the airport!!!
50,The resort in general is quite nice. Great casino nice selection of shops and restaurants and the staff is 10/10.    My only complaint and I'm not sure if this is standard across all Vegas hotels is that there was no coffee maker in the room single serve or otherwise. The closest coffee shop (that's open at 6am) is clear across the casino floor from the guest elevators.    I get the decision. I'm sure at some point a study was conducted that found guests are likely to throw a few bucks in a machine on their way to get their morning coffee particularly after a night of hard drinking when their faculties haven't returned. Just seems like a cheap move.
40,Conveniently centrally located on the Strip - The Mirage is a great place to stay. The Sportsbook and Casino are both clean well-managed with an excellent staff. Very good restaurants are on the premises. The rooms are clean and comfortable - but need to be updated
20,Room was tired. Nothing fancy. The attention to details were not great. There were only 2 electrical outlets in the room the shower drain didn’t drain so my bathroom floor was always wet. $300 a night for nothing special.
30,The room was decent but the shower wasn’t great. The tub filled up with water while showering and the knob to turn on and off the water felt like it was going to break off. Other than that the stay was good!
50,With MGM Rewards we enjoyed VIP experience without paying VIP cost. Great room hotel and service. I highly recommended becoming members and enjoying the amenities they have to offer. Play dine and earn complimentary stays.
40,This hotel is definitely a step up from the inexpensive ones not luxurious but perfectly nice would recommend. The location was great loved being close to the Forum Shops we had a view of the volcano from the room which was cool. The room was a nice size and in good condition beds were firm (I prefer softer) bathroom was nice but nothing special with not much in the way of amenities staff were friendly and helpful the gym had decent equipment. The pool is beautiful but was disappointed that they closed so early at 5pm while it was still light out. I have 2 negatives:  1. The pillows were incredibly uncomfortable. Most resorts have a combination of soft and firm pillows to choose from they only had all firm pillows with what felt like synthetic stuffing.  2. They say they have a refrigerator in the room but it's completely stocked with their own items for sale with no room to put in your own items.
10,They obviously are transitioning to the HardRock hotel remodel rebuild whatever it’s called. Employees aren’t sure if they have a job or not. Moral seems pretty low. Rates were cheap now I know why. Dirty the smell of smoking in the room so bad I couldn’t stay there. I left and went to Bellagio
30,Older property with a great location on the strip.    Rooms are outdated in general compared to newer properties. Room rates are excessive for what would be comparable to a national chain like Marriott.    Amenities are over priced Restaurants have average food quality at premium prices. Drink prices excessive. $20 + for an average drink.
40,Mirage is a very nice property with a great location. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Only issues is the bed was a bit to soft but that just may be me. The other though is it would be nice if they had a food court or more reasonably priced food options. But not the end of the world as there is a food court on the other side of the street from the hotel.
50,My second time staying here - and it was just as nice in 2022 as it was in 2019. Easy to get around the hotel nice dining options early check in (for a fee). Staff everywhere was efficient and friendly. I don’t know what will happen when Hard Rock takes over but I’m afraid it won’t be the same.
50,The hotel was great. The room nice and the atmosphere great. Will be coming back soon. Thanks MGM. Food is also good. Waitresses are a bit understaffed but I see them working as hard as they can to bring out drinks.
30,My husband and I stayed at the Mirage the last weekend in October 2022 for my birthday. We had a fantastic stay! The hotel rooms restaurant choices bars and casino options were phenomenal! The food was a 10+! Meanwhile I have concerns about there not being a refrigerator or microwave in the hotel rooms. This makes the experience very expensive and unpleasant because you have to throw away so much food. Most people who eat out take to go boxes back to their rooms only to find out there is no microwave or refrigerator. In addition to this I have SERIOUS concerns about the wheelchair accessible rooms. I went to the front desk to report our concerns and they agreed to change our room but the hotel was completely sold out. I also shared our concerns with the housekeeping manager. They tried to assist but could not remedy this problem. Lastly after returning home we called express this to guest experience or the team who handles customer concerns and requested a supervisor call us back. We have not heard a word. Although we enjoyed our stay I don't take being ignored lightly.
50,Already planning a trip back next year! Everyone was so nice and welcoming. Very convenient for everything we had planned and when we didn’t feel like leaving the hotel there was still plenty of stuff to do
10,Hotel is rundown. The room and bathroom were awful. The shower soaps towels etc. sub-standard especially for what they charge. The gym equipment is outdated. The entire place needs a remodel. It clearly is ready to be torndown.
50,We've been going to the Mirage a few times per year since it opened in 1989 and will miss it when the sale takes place at the end of the year. We're hoping the Hard Rock can live up to the same standards as the Mirage.
40,"Enjoyable stay. Would've been excellent if the mattress was better. Great staff. Very attentive. Slot machines need work as many didn't except player's card. ""Stacks"" Restaurant and staff 5-Star rating."
20,Rumor has it that this tired old property has a date with the wrecking ball in the coming months. You can see it's future in the nasty unmaintained elevators and carpeting. While the staff are great the infrastructure is crumbling all around them.
50,First time at Vegas  Very good experience I recommend it  Hotel the mirage excellent service at all  Good location nice view of city parking  Access to freeways good prices  Definitely we plan come back soon
50,Guest rooms do not have coffee makers. I realize that would reduce business to room service and the in-casino Starbucks but even if they charge for coffee like the minibar would be better than not having the option at all.
40,Enjoyed this hotel - stayed here many times. It’s a convenient location clean and not too difficult to get around. Looking forward to the update after the sale if this hotel to the Hard Rick Cafe. Great pool tool!
10,Reserved a room for two queen beds received two full size. Door didn’t close and seal correctly could hear everything in the hallway. Bathtub didn’t drain and was severely clogged taking a shower was gross.
50,My stay was great and the food options were great. We had Italian and Japanese food and both options were awesome. The MGM veteran member rewards have great perks and it’s great to know they are thankful for military personnel service.
10,Their service and attitude suck! Don’t recommend staying after change because they are keeping the same staff! 200 characters to explain that your company sucks…. I hope you’re not investing in anymore businesses. Not the same as last time I stayed there!
50,Super clean super friendly super helpful!! The staff was the most accommodating I’ve ever experienced!!  Location was perfect for our work schedule as well as our leisure schedule!! Highly recommend to anyone traveling to Las Vegas for any reason at all!!
50,Our stay at the Mirage was excellent. Check-in was fairly easy the room was exceptionally clean and the ride share area was easy to access. I only wish that we could have stayed longer to enjoy all amenities before they close it down.
20,The few times the staff spoke to us was considerably rude and unprofessional. The room it self had a couple of issues that we were not fans of. First was the AC doesn’t run unless you’re in the room. This makes the room very hot and muggy when you come back at night. Also where our room was situated there was lights from the roof below that would shine into the room even with the blackout curtains and shades over the windows.
10,I disliked having to pay a $39resort fee $5.22 resort fee tax and $18 parking fee too. It's not worth it for me to pay extra fees like this per day for a casino. I won't be staying here again. I'll stay at a hotel instead.
50,We stay at The Mirage every time we go to Vegas. We are sorry to see that it won't be a MGM property for much longer but we are looking forward to seeing the changes that will be made. This hotel is fabulous from the staff the restaurants the rewards and the ambience! So convenient to a lot of things on the strip too!
50,Check in was great we were able to get double beds even thought we booked a single. The pantry had great breakfast and snacks also had great food! The room was big and clean. We relaxed by the pool one afternoon and it was right in the sun path. The staff at both Starbucks were really friendly. Great overall stay!
30,The Mirage overall isn’t a bad hotel…the room was nice and generally very clean as was the casino floor. The problem came with drink service in the casino. I’m not sure if they were short staffed or simply don’t know how to properly staff but I spent 10-12 hours gambling and got offered a drink once. Even the pit bosses couldn’t find anyone for drink service. This happened multiple times during peak periods during the evening hours. If I’m going to throw away thousands of dollars gambling I feel like I should at least get some drinks to enjoy it with right? I ended up leaving the Mirage and gambling at Treasure Island and Harrah’s instead. Much better drink service!
50,Great location customer service clean rooms and proactive security patrol. Every thing at the Mirage made our stay perfect.    Well staff customer service rooms clean staff were friendly and curtious.
10,Rooms had no fridge or microwave the soap they give you for showers doesnt clean you Beds are not comfy The games at the casino is very predictable. Over $1000 for 3 nights place is a complete rip off
50,The Mirage has always been our favorite place to stay in Las Vegas. The hotel is centrally located easy to get around and the staff are very friendly and kind. I will miss this place when they close to rebuild the hotel.
30,Having been to the Mirage for 10+ years I’ve remained loyal and dedicated to staying at the property for all my trips. This trip however left a lot to be desired. Outside of Nilo (Bartender at the Center Bar) my other dining/drinking experiences left me  Aggregated and disgusted. This has been the worst experience (outside of Nilo) that I’ve ever had and it seemed like the Management didn’t care because the property announced they are selling out to Hard Rock at the end of the year.
50,Quick trip but had a wonderful experience at The Mirage! All staff encountered were friendly and professional. The digital key feature in their app is so efficient! No standing in lines to check-in! You’re notified when the room is ready and you go straight to it — use your digital key and you’re in! Check-out just as easy! Clean room comfy bed nice view! The restaurants were plentiful and made it hard to choose. We landed at Diablo’s Cantina — delicious meal and cocktails! Service was quick!! Would definitely stay again!

50,Beautiful hotel with a great location. The kids really enjoyed the volcano and the pet stay option was a priority of ours. Our room was very clean and comfortable as was the entire facility. Parking was great with easy access to the lobby/casino. Staff was knowledgeable and very friendly..... even gave out Halloween candy and gifts to our kids. Can't say enough great things about our stay. Oh and the price was very reasonable as well.
20,Have been staying at the Mirage for a number of years. Spent 4 nights at the Mirage. First of all the staff at the Mirage are super. Anything you needed they were there. However the rooms are dated and not spotless. But the worst thing about the trip this year and previous years was the casino. Table games were changed to make it harder for customers to win anything at all. Minimum bets were high. No one was winning it was like throwing money away. Usually you used to be able to make enough money on the slots to keep playing but the slot are so tight you can’t even do that! As a matter of fact I went to the other casinos around the Mirage to gamble. It’s sad because I probably won’t go back to the Mirage anymore.
20,I suppose on the weekends the staff doesn't care because they can get away with it. This had been on my wishlist of stays for a while. Very disappointed. Staff rude food selection and taste suboar. Then I was charged more for spa services than advertised. Never again
50,I simply love this place. The restaurant choices are great. The property is so well maintained and everyone that works there is so friendly. Fantastic location on the strip too. You can't go wrong here.
10,"The first 2 days of my stay I had to change my room 3 times. The first time was because they hadn't cleaned the room after the previous guests' stay so the beds were a mess there was trash on the floor etc. The 2nd room they gave me seemed fine until at 5:40am I was woken up by the freeway noise. When I called to complain they agreed to put me in another room on the other side of the hallway (odd number rooms you're welcome). So I packed my bags and moved AGAIN. All seemed fine and dandy (except by the way the ""digital keys"" they offer on their App don't work the elevators so you need a normal plastic key card anyhow) until 1:00am that next night when a terrifying fire alarm sounded throwing me out of bed in a state of delirium: is there a fire a bomb a terrorist attack? What the hell is going on? Should I evacuate in my underwear? When it finally stopped 5 mins later I called the front desk and they told me that it was because someone was smoking in their room. YOU SOUND AN ALARM ACROSS THE ENTIRE HOTEL AT 1:00AM BECAUSE SOMEONE WAS SMOKING??? F/U!    So yeah don't stay at this hotel."
10,Guest elevator way too far. No buffet. No complimentary breakfast. No refrigerator for personal use. No microwave. Reserved rooms on different floors no elevator access. Volcano shows wait too late for children long intervals.
30,Rooms are outdated and smelled like mold and mildew. Next visit I’m definitely staying at another hotel. Also save your money and don’t eat at the restaurant by the pool the food seems like it’s microwaved.
10,The heater no work and staff no care and I got charge full and when I want to cancel the 2nd night to go to other hotel staff so rude and said you cannot cancel your reservation.I recommend donot go there
40,Room was very roomy and wheelchair friendly. The ceiling track lift was a lifesaver. Staff was friendly helpful and accommodating. Start to finish. Our room was a little dated but still really accessible.
50,I came to town for a work-related stay and chose this location because of the value and I haven't been here in a while. I enjoyed all the shops here and was sad to hear the dolphins was closed. I hope it will re-open and I will visit again before the guitar stand over the volcano.
40,The Mirage has a good location but expect everything to be expensive. They now charge for everything plus you will pay $40 USD per day just to use the pool and $18 USD per day to park your car. Coffee will be $6+ Water 6+ etc. Drinks $20+
50,The staff was super helpful whether it was at the front desk the luggage/bell desk the pool and/ or the casino. The hotel itself was beautiful and didn’t have a strong smell of cigarettes. The location is right on the strip and next to the mall which was convenient!
20,Our room smelled like cigarettes and the tub was clogged. I asked to be switched to another room the AC didn't work in the new room. The Pantry restaurant got my order wrong when I picked it up. I called them to let them know and they wanted me to bring the order back down for them to see it and then they would correct it. Very poor customer service. Was quite the hassle to get them to give me a credit on the meal.
40,We took advantage of a free room that was offered through MGM rewards. Although the room was free we still had to pay about $35 for the resort fee and $18 for parking. It wasn't their fault I chose to gamble as well and had no luck but that's Vegas! No such thing as a free lunch. Room was nice and dinner at their sports bar The Still was excellent.
50,We've stayed at many hotels along the Strip and I'd have to say I'll definitely be staying here again. I liked the rooms better than the Aria and the Bellagio even. Very nice hotel. Easy check in. No complaints.
40,We were there on a combo work/vacation. Most of the staff we met were great. Room was nice bed comfy.  The safe didn't work but since we didn't have a lot of valuables we just lived with it.  I really wish they had coffee makers in the room. It is a pain having to go down and buy a $5 cup.  And I wish there had been robes in the room.
30,The outside of the hotel looks nice but the rooms are old and run down inside and not maintained. It is outrageous to me that the pool closes at 6PM. After a hard day at work you can't even go swimming.
10,The hotel offered less amenities than most low budget hotels for way more money. There was not even a fridge or microwave in the room for guest use (only a weighted mini bar). There was a hole in the ceiling in the bathroom and the mirror had damage to it. The staff running the conference were rude on several occasions that I saw to various guests / conference attendees. And finally they still allow smoking in the casino (which is a problem for people like me who are pregnant and need to walk through the casino to get to the lobby). I am overall unsatisfied with my stay.
50,Ruining the Mirage and making it a stupid guitar would be the biggest downgrade in the history of downgrades. Las Vegas is for dreams too good to be true bring that guitar hotel sh*t to Nashville. I will always be thankful I got to stay in a beautiful hotel before it gets absolutely trashed by new management.
10,Our room was like a sauna… it even had a window and with both the AC on and window open it still felt like a hot day in the tropics. Most channels on the TV had no audio. We were on the 11th floor. Parking had a cost even though we stayed for three days. And to top it all off the Mirage is no longer with MGM after this year… so you aren’t able to redeem any myVEGAS rewards while staying here… I had several that I wanted to redeem but all Mirage rewards have been taken off the myVEGAS app. I didn’t know this until I got to the hotel so it was already too late or I would have stayed at one of their other properties. Additionally the Mirage should have more breakfast options for early raisers and also should consider opening the buffet back up… no one is masking anyway.
50,My wife and were married at the Mirage in October 2022. Our rooms and rooms of our wedding party were all clean and in good order. The staff were all friendly responsive and kind. And that volcano made for some killer wedding pics! Would stay again!
20,I stayed here because the conference I attended was held here. Everything was rundown. Not the luxury I was expecting. Scratchy sheets lumpy sad pillows. Volcano was super loud. Room temperature was easy to regulate so that's a plus.
50,the food was great in the cafe the rooms were clean fast elevators good service from the staff and the casino is well covered in gaming opportunities. the sports book is great also.  check in and check out were efficient.
40,Room was nice - but view of a roof was less than nice - hotel pool is very nice and relaxing. Breakfast in cafe was good but expensive. Check-in on line was quick and easy. Casino was not too crowded and lot of choices.
50,Hotel & Casino were clean and rooms were nice. Clean and no issues. The staff was very helpful and polite. We requested a strip view and received one. Checking in and out was very easy and the way to go. All mobile and no waiting in line. I recommend this Hotel & Casino.
10,We arrived there at 2:30pm and waited over 5hrs for our room only to find out our initial room was given away to other guests. I think this hotel prioritize their guess over 3rd party company booking. Paid almost 700$ for a room that was dirty and old looking especially the bathroom the shower curtain the tubs on top of the over 5hrs wait to receive our room.
40,Hotel staff were very accommodating. I appreciate a smile and a “have a good day” wish thrown to me. And everyone was awesome. Not full 5 star due to the smoke smell in the casino itself. Don’t get me wrong I hang with smokers and smoked myself for 15 years. It was just a little overwhelming. The rooms were great clean and was in the north tower with some strip views.
50,The Mirage is awesome and always has been! The staff is top notch and always friendly polite and incredibly helpful. The rooms were very clean and housekeeping came every day. The whole place is just cozy and relaxing. I love the Mirage!
20,For the price I’d rather stay somewhere else. The room was dirty and outdated nothing special and does not reflect the beauty of the entrance or the pool. The rest of the hotel is beautiful and the pool is really cool and relaxing.
20,I was in town for a conference and had the worst Vegas experience ever. Terrible service mixed facilities impressions MLife inconsistencies employee dismisiveness and dishonest. I am so disappointed. What should have been wonderful was awful.
50,I was attending a conference that was being held at The Mirage. My experience was wonderful. The hotel staff was very professional proficient and attentive. The hotel itself is very clean and beautiful.
50,I'm sad to hear they are taking down this giant Icon and replacing it with a guitar. Ever since I was a child we would come and visit Vegas and would always stand Infront of the volcano for pics. I believe this will be the final picture. Your rooms are awesome the food was great. I won money at the machines. I bought Beatles stuff and was reminded of the time we used to go see all the animals.
40,Mgm rewards great comp rooms offers on a regular basis - great incitative to take advantage of it and return to LV and enjoy these beautiful resorts Bellagio The Mirage etc and casinos and all tha menities they have to offer : fine restaurants rooms and great services from the all the personnel in general
50,My first time in Vegas and I found our hotel to be perfect for a mid-cost resort. Right in the middle with accessibility to malls Cesar’s Venetian and Bellagio. Very clean and friendly staff. Plenty of places to eat without even leaving. Will be back!
30,Lovely view and great location (volcano view room). My room was clean but lacked a coffee maker. Coffee shop lines were very long! In addition the refrigerator is set up fully for in room sales and you have to request one to use for your own items. I would've also appreciated a smart tv as my viewing options were very limited. Sadly there was also a rat sighting at the volcano.
40,The Mirage was a pretty good place to stay for the conference I went to. The only thing I didn't love was that the bathtub in my room had flaking enamel and looked kind of gross. I wore flip flops in the shower. Everything else was great though.
40,I stayed at the Mirage for a work conference so my employer paid for the trip. The service from all who work at the hotel was exceptional (front desk bartender cleaning). The location is convenient and the room and amenities are nice. The app doesn't work very well so I got a card for the elevators and my room. I wouldn't stay here on my own dime.
30,I stayed for business and primarily remained between the pool area the conference area the elevator and my room. The cigarette smell from all of the smokers made the casino intolerable even with a mask on. Saved me money because I wasn't out gambling. They do have a non-smoking slot machine area pushed off into the corner which is nice but you have to walk through the cigarettes to get to it. The food options were good. The location on the strip is good if you want to go out and about to explore. Room service was quick and easy and they have a good variety of selections. I would have liked a coffee maker in my room instead of having to buy a $16 box of hot water to make tea. Otherwise it was quite pleasant.
40,Great location a little older hotel but fine. They were not interested in The World Series and we had a real hard time finding a good spot to watch with our group in the hotel. We finally ended up watching w no sound! Sportsbook was good - ask for Seth! Rhumbar bar manager was VERY RUDE and would not put WS on - crazy!!! Diablos was good food and friendly staff especially the bartenders.
50,We had a very relaxing weekend at the Mirage. Staff provided exceptional customer service at the front desk and the restaurants. The hotel was clean quiet and just an overall great weekend in sunny Las Vegas!
50,I had a great time on my trip and I would definitely stay here again. My room was great I enjoyed my dinner at the Costa Italian Restaurant and the property is well kept. I was traveling with my family and they also enjoyed themselves.
50,Great staff and beautiful hotel/casino. All the restaurants have great food and staff. Best location on the strip and easy access to rooms. Check in with cellphone made things very easy. We will be staying at the mirage the next time we come.
50,Liked the casino. No good bars though. Diablo was awful. Enchiladas were terrible and overpriced. Snacks Restaurant gave large portions and was reasonably priced. Open all hours. Starbucks always packed and very slow. Room was ok. Nothing special. Dumb view of a roof.
50,All the years that we’ve gone to Vegas we’ve always stayed at Maroge Very sad to see it go mirage is a great place to stay and the volcano was Awesome to watch The staff was great the front desk was very helpful The cleaning staff was impeccable
50,The property is clean and fairly modern. It is a very large hotel and conference center so it did not feel too cramped even with our 3500 attendees. The staff is excellent and helpful! The rooms can be updated a bit but seemed very clean.
30,As stated front end was rude and flat out lied to.me. got an unexpected $100 credit but that did not wipe out the hosts rudness after I forgave the transgression. Food in stack.was poor (think Dennys quality) for Michelin prices.
50,While I preface this review by saying that I only travel to Vegas for conferences I did enjoy my stay at The Mirage. It’s well-situated on the strip and close to lots of other sites and amenities. My only recommendation is for improved signage to get folks to the convention area.
50,Very well situated on the strip  excellent fitness center & swimming pool  multiple bars  nice decent size rooms  clean  friendly staff  and fantastic shows.. Everything was satisfactory or above except for the selection of choices to eat after 10 pm at night ... very very limited
10,A fully stocked refrigerator that can’t be utilized for fear of being charged $18 for a bottle  Of  Water is all you need to know. Everything was ridiculous overpriced. I didn’t have a meal for less than $200 every night. Homeless people everywhere.
20,The rooms are so outdated and have damage to them that has never been repaired. The AC units in the room suck. The digital keys using your phone work half the time. The casino is basic. The toiletries provided smell disgusting. Like I understand this is an older hotel on the Strip but at $200+ per night you expect more than a budget experience.
10,Over value for the hotel conditions. Carpet and furniture need to be replaced Shows wear and tear. Rooms extremely dirty rust and bathtub drain.  No coffee maker or water is supply . Very poor customer service
10,"The only thing that deserves any stars is the staff they're beautiful people.    My deposit was just as much as the room seriously nearly $600. Walking down the hall there are random painted over doors with exposed metal just ready to slice your leg open if you're not paying attention. The windows open? Yeah that's a super safe feature to have in a sky rise. The carpet is straight from the 70's and has not been clean since then. Im pretty sure the ""grey"" circles on the carpet are supposed to be white. Also there is a GIANT run bump in the carpet. I found it by tripping over it. The bathroom in the ""suite"" is so small I can'l hardly turn around. There is no bell service at the ride share drop off no luggage carts at all. There isn't room to open more than one suitcase at a time. So if you're one person traveling by yourself with the sole purpose of getting hammered in the room the size of my bedroom closet this might be for you. As for me I'm leaving.    To add insult to the entire situation there is a penalty fee to leave before the completion of your stay. No offer to make anything right no offer to comp any part of the stay no offer for free drinks or even an acknowledgment from the manager that we were upset. There was no attempt to sway us to stay at this “resort”."
20,What an experience and not in a good way. Staff were unhelpful regarding the check in check out and taxi line experience. The room was straight out of a Stephen King novel - no outlets you don’t know what switch does what the bathroom is tiny and cramped.
10,Room was disgusting. Sheets were stained and ripped. Hair was everywhere in the bathroom and room. We found a fake eyelash stuck to the closet in the room and the carpet was full of debris. Had to shower in own home to feel right again.
50,The Mirage always takes care of you. The staff go above and beyond. The rooms are clean and beautiful. The food choices are excellent and the app gives you great deals on room prices. What more can you ask for?
50,All of the staff members we interacted with were very friendly and helpful with a special shoutout to Andres Justin and Fatima at the front desk--they went above and beyond to make it a great stay for us. I hope to see them on my next trip. Other positives were the great location and the very comfortable bed.
10,Honestly for how expensive it is you’re better off spending the extra money and staying elsewhere. The beds and pillows were so firm I hardly could sleep and the deposit and resort fees on top of the nightly average being over 300 seemed so extra. The check in staff was rude. If you’re going to spend 1500 for a weekend you might as well go somewhere nicer because it’s not worth the money
50,The staff is so friendly been going since 96 and never had a bad experience. Also clean hotel smells so good. Sorry it’s changing hands! Had a great time with the slots was really good to us! Check in and out was GREAT!
50,Lots to do there and close walk to promenade. I would recommend visiting the sugar martini bar on the promenade. We also enjoyed the dinner at Stacks within the Mirage. It was some of the best food we have had in Vegas.
50,My trip and hotel stay at the mirage was excellent. The food location of hotel staff my entire stay was top notch. I would recommend this hotel to all my family and friends to stay when visiting. Thanks again
50,Absolutely TOP NOTCH in every way. Room food staff entertainment... Everything and Everyone!! No matter what we did or where we went throughout the Hotel we truly were amazed at the decor the cleanliness and more importantly the friendly and caring staff that waited on us and took wonderful care of us. Thank you so much
30,Convenient location but dated room and amenities. Great staff but minimal food options in comparison to neighboring hotels. Unfortunately the dolphin preserve was closed and pool was not enjoyable due to the weather. Still a good hotel but needs upgrading.
40,Beautiful resort friendly staff. Be prepared for a lot of walking. And the extra surcharges. The room does not have a microwave. And there is a charge to use/put your own items in the refrigerator in your room.
50,The property has aged very well. It’s super clean good food choices and friendly staff. We stayed on property quite a bit and found a nice variety of machines and tables. The pool area was also very well maintained. Overall a great experience.
50,Very clean hotel and casino. Offering a non smoking slot section was wonderful. Great staff and excellent layout of casino. My wife and I had a wonderful time there and would definitely stay at the Mirage again if we were in Vegas
50,Great clean hotel with very friendly staff. Only gambled a little bit the casino seemed nice. The location was about center Strip so we loved the location. We really enjoyed eating at the pantry especially because you can have breakfast all day. The pool was beautiful with several waterfalls.
10,Not friendly staff air quality in the rooms terrible very stuffy most of us felt sick after a day here  Don’t eat at “Snacks” absolutely terrible  Casino is good pool area is great  But overall we won’t be back 3 hotel rooms used between our group. And all but one felt sick from the air quality in the room
30,The staff was friendly and courteous but the hotel is old and outdated . The location is ok and restaurants adequate. The overall value is not good for what we paid . The check in process was smooth but we should have been warned about putting outside drinks in the refrigerator
50,I recently stayed at the mirage hotel and give it a 10/10. I visit Vegas frequently and will make sure to always stay at the mirage. Special shout out to Andres Justin and Fatima for making my stay extra special. See you soon! RB
10,Unfortunately The Mirage has gone way down hill….even in the off-season the pool staff acted too busy….rewards aren’t great….comparable to the Luxor….save some money and use your points towards a different property….I think I’m not alone when I say people are super excited about the property turning into The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino
40,Stayed at the Mirage for 3 nights in October. The room was clean and bed was comfortable. Online check in was great and the location is fantastic. Very few waitresses in the casino to take drink orders. Food at the restaurants was good.
40,"The stay was very nice and the staff were great. The bedding was terrible and uncomfortable. Recommend at a minimum an extra blanket in the room. All the amenities were convenient and I got to meet the ""GOAT"" of Track/Field."
40,Great location great service everything was clean and everyone was very friendly and helpful.  BUT the room we stayed in had some of the trim held together with tape and the furniture was a bit worn. Definitely not a deal breaker but maybe its starting to show its age.
50,Check in was quick and easy. The room was very clean and spacious. The restaurants and shops in the hotel were exactly what we needed and liked. We saw the magic show and it was greatly entertaining and overall we loved our getaway weekend in Las Vegas.
40,We have been to the property a number of times and have had a wonderful experience. This time the hotel is starting to show its age however the staff was wondeful and the location is still great. We are looking forward to seeing the updates under the new management.
30,With all the choices on the strip I would probably not choose to stay here again. The room was very dirty upon arrival: stains on the floor urine in the toilet dirty glassware and didn't smell fresh or clean. It is very expensive especially adding additional resort fees on check-in. I would not recommend the rooms with a view because it doesn't add any value.    Good things: The restaurants were very good and the restaurant staff were nice. Book late checkout in advance if you need the time until 3pm - that was a nice offer. It's way more expensive day of.
40,Stayed at the Mirage due to the proximity to the festival. Never stayed here before but would love to continue as long as I can until Hard Rock takes over. We stayed in the Penthouse and it was very spacious with a beautiful view of the strip and Volcano.
50,Easiest reservation desk. Easy check-in. Clean rooms and nice staff every where. Sleep Well room was great! Everyone there was very helpful. Food was excellent waitresses were everywhere offering beverages. Central location.
50,Love the Mirage! Attended the Love Beatles show and Shim Lin's magic show and loved them. Staff are always friendly and helpful. This property is always my Vegas destination will be very sad to see it go.
20,"The rooms are quite tired. My desk chair had peeling upholstery coming off and there are lots of scuffs. My tub did not drain properly either. And despite paying a ""resort fee"" there weren't even basic amenities like coffee in the room."
10,The hotel is old and it really shows. The lack of water friendly in the restrooms is a concern while lake mead is draining. The 4 restaurants at the hotel taste like US foods the checkin and check out process is long. The MGM app is buggy and very hard to navigate.
50,First time in Vegas and I am happy that the Mirage was a part of that experience. The staff was fantastic the dealers were patient with all my questions the rooms were spacious and clean.  Would definitely stay here again.
20,We spent over $2100 for 3 nights. We expected our room to reflect that. The room had so many issues- and we planned almost a year an advance and we didn’t receive what we requested. From fridge not working carpets dirty counter tops with alcohol residue from previous stay outlets didn’t work in the master room.
50,Fun safe location with great service and casino. Restaurants are adequate and have a variety of options. Sports book is awesome and the experience is amazing.  I will definitely be back again and found my new second home .
50,Love this hotel but Hard Rock will take its place! Hope they keep the lovely palm trees! Location is perfect- so easy to get to the other hotels. The casino are has plenty of table games with decent minimums.  Would love to come back but it was sold!
50,We always stay at the mirage. The service is excellent. The rooms are clean and spacious. The only issue I have is that there should be a fan in each room. Too quiet. The overall resort is beautiful. We love it there!
30,We chose the Mirage because of it's great location on the strip and room appearance/quality. The staff was very friendly and helpful but we did have a decent issue during our stay with mold/mildew in our room. Staff did correct as best as they could but my friend and I did get sick from being in the room 1 night before being moved. Still enjoyed our stay and the hotel.
50,Stayed at The Mirage for the first time and was very happy with the experience! I attended for a conference but was also able to enjoy amenities like the pool. Every staff member was friendly and everything felt very clean and well-maintained. The location also made it easy to access nearby casinos and attractions.
50,Overall and so far one of the best stays we’ve had. Bed was comfortable room was basic but nice our floor was quite good amount of places to eat and very close to the place we needed to be very nice say.
40,The staff at the Mirage were terrific. A couple of things I’d like to see are in-room coffee. Instead of having to walk a fair distance and wait 30 min in line. Also the single ply toilet paper could use an upgrade. Lastly the charging station is across the room - having a couple of ports bedside would be nice.
20,Used the mobile app to pre check in - room to be ready by 3 would have digital key and could go directly to my room. None of that happened to had to stand in a long line to check in - no real apology from the staff as they just check people in - they don't seem to care if you use the app or not.
40,Our stay was nice the staff was very friendly. Check in was simple and fast. Mirage offered nice restaurants and shopping on location and is centrally located on the strip. There was a few noisy guests coming in throughout the night but hey it’s Vegas
40,We went with a group of couples to celebrate. Great food at the Italian restaurant. Unfortunately our pool day was canceled by high winds. Great service in the casino with some inexperienced players. Spa was fantastic.
50,The Mirage is a great place to stay in the middle of everything and has everything that you need and much more. The staff here is very attentive and makes sure that you have everything that you need for the best stay. Great overall experience every time I have been here
20,Exhibits closed. Pool closes at 5pm never got to use it. Rooms smelt bad carpets stained. Restaurants and bars pricy so we went to other ones. Staff had no personality. Great location and great access to cabs and Ubers.
10,"Never coming back. This was an exceedingly overpriced predatory second-hand smoke extravaganza. Poor cleanliness lead me to slip and fall in the lobby. $45 for two drinks. Room lacked fridge & microwave. Most of the so-called ""resort"" restaurants only open 5-10 some days of the week usually booked full. Staff unhelpful when trying to find how to purchase additional services like upgraded internet. Plus hotel WIFI completely unsecured -- do you have any idea how risky that is???"
40,Stayed here many years ago when it was new. I was attending an event at the Venetian and wanted something close by but not Venetian prices.    The hotel is still overall clean and the staff was wonderful. Everyone I talked to was helpful and friendly. It seemed lines at some of the restaurants were longer than you’d expect I suspect a possible staff shortage.    The room was nice if not a little dated. The AC didn’t seem to cool as much as I’d have liked some grout cracked in the bathroom and the shower drained VERY slowly. The room was large (tower king) and the bed was very comfortable. I was impressed with how quiet the room was.    I hate that this will soon be a Hard Rock hotel it seems all the hotels with Vegas history seem to go away. I would definitely stay here again and will miss the Mirage when it’s gone.
10,I stayed at the Mirage for a weeklong conference. I did not choose the conference hotel but I was excited to stay on property for convenience and the pool seemed awesome based on photos.    Upon check-in I found the room to still have signs of prior guest. Bring your own bath soap or body wash because it is not provided. On multiple days I stayed at the hotel the gym opened at 9 am which is later than the 6 am posted open time. Groups of hotel attendees would gather outside the doors but hotel staff indicated the spa was operated by a separate entity and could not open the doors.    Beware when big conferences or events are happening at the hotel the pool closes early some sections as early as 3:30 pm. Getting breakfast or lunch on property was a Herculean task; many options were not open. The only open options had wait times near an hour during peak times; Starbucks had lines though the lobby/casino area.    I brought up the issues to the front desk who shared the hotel was facing staffing issues. Many of the staff members were unhelpful when issues arouse (my colleague got stuck in an elevator and my keycards randomly stopped working) and they often seemed stressed.    There are many options when staying in Vegas. I would not come back.
50,I was greeted by friendly staff at the front desk and they were very accommodating. Every time I stay here I have great experiences which is why I return. I love the location and great restaurants nearby as well. I highly recommend stay at the Mirage. Great value and fair prices.
10,make sure you check your account when you leave they to always try to do an extra charge second in a row i had to call and get my account fixed and money refunded  this has been the second time this has happened at this hotel ! watch your accounts
40,It is good but Very less food choices and need few more and also the service could be better. The location is convenient as it is in the middle of strip. There is no value for MGM rewards and it could be better
50,The location on the strip is great. The spa and the gym facilities are clean well maintained and easily accessible. The staff is very helpful and friendly. We are returning in March with our grown children!
40,The plants was so awesome and the fish aquarium was out of this world.  Now I would of prefer to see a person vcleaning the machines especially with covid monkey pox going on and the cigarette smell I could not get pass and people coughing should of w wear .a mask they cough in hand then touch the machines unbelievable &
30,My room was dirty upon arrival. There was hair and glitter all over the floor in near the bed hair on the bathroom floor and sticky food stuck to the tile when I entered the room.    The faucet in my bathtub was broken and I was unable to turn the water on. When I contacted the front desk about this they could not provide an ETA to fix it on the date of arrival. They scheduled maintenance to repair it the following morning but maintence did not show up on time. When I contacted the front desk about this they seemed irritated but sent someone up to repair it.
10,No microwave no fridge no coffee in rooms. Lights shining into the room all night from the roof below are not blocked out because the curtains don’t really even close and have rips in them. Furniture is beat up and drawers are near impossible to close. Safe didn’t work.
40,The location is perfect the staffing is VERY nice she friendly but the room service is weak. There are not many options abs it was hard to get ahold of them. It was challenging to make reservations at the hotel restaurants as well.
50,Been in LV 25 yrs - had a great relaxing staycation! Forgot what a little hidden gem the Mirage is! Under-rated with all the glitz and glamour of the strip - But definitely an oldie but goodie! And don't forget to check out LOVE - what an amazing show!
10,Rooms are VERY old and nearly nothing worked correctly. Tub was gross and didn’t even drain most of the time. Do yourself a favor and for the same price stay somewhere far newer. Many of the casino staff were rude as well.
50,The atmosphere at the Mirage was truly amazing... An awesome oasis in the desert... The staff was super friendly and helpful the hotel and casino were squeaky clean... All of restaurants are top quality and the pool was incredible...
50,Really nice hotel great views from my room and the staff was very friendly and great restaurants to eat. The volcano show at night was really great to watch. The casino floor was really well spread out.
50,Amazing room with beautiful view over the volcano. I loved the fist tank at reception and that the hotel wasn’t trying to be anything extra. It is a Casino and it is impeccably clean. Great choice and variety of restaurants. We watched both of the shows they had on. The staff were attentive and helpful. Never made you wait long. Always wanting you to have your positive holiday and experience.    Toilet roll was a bit thin but same with all hotels these days. Toiletries were lovely. Facilities were well set out and I would highly recommend staying here over and above other hotels on the strip.
20,"The Mirage is at least a 40-year-old hotel that will be remodeled into the new Hard Rock Casino. That was supposed to start last February I believe and it couldn't happen quickly enough. We liked the hotel/casino because it was relatively compact and not an ""attraction"" like the Venetian or Paris but the rooms were very worn and had that old hotel smell and the bathrooms were sorely lacking (our tub drain didn't really work).    I'm sure that will all be fixed with the remodel but that will not change the price gouging that goes on not only here but all over Vegas. $18.00 for a bottle of water and $15.00 for a packet of cookies in your room. $20 for a basic cocktail $10 for a bottle of beer and not to mention food bills will run you hundreds of dollars. The food in Vegas is amazing but like everything else is very expensive.    The room did not have a refrigerator only a bar fridge with no extra room so bring a soft cooler to pack in your luggage go to Walgreens across the street and fill it up with everything you may need and keep it on ice."
40,Good Overall stay. Room was clean. Decent food in the lobby with a few different choices. I did not visit the pool or lounge this time around. We ate at the Japanese place in the lobby which was decent. Also at the Pantry for breakfast. It was a quick walk over to the Caesar shops as well.
50,I would definitely recommend staying at The Mirage before they tear it down in order to build the new Hard Rock Hotel. It is a great place to stay alone or with the entire family! Plus you can't forget about the volcano.
40,Thousands of reviews here on this soon to be closed property so I'll be brief. Best feature is location about half way up the Strip. The Beatles Cirque du Soleil show was amazing and worth every cent. The hotel's conciege cheerfully arranged for tickets. The pool is heated but could have been turned up about 10 degrees more. Thus hardly anyone in the water. The property is well run and very organized. Housekeeping was really good. The staff in general was very friendly. Plenty of choices for eating and drinking but can also be done on the cheap with easy walking distance options. Enjoy this place before it closes for good in December.
50,This Hotel was a perfect location for my stay. Had a business conference and it was located very close to the Venetian Expo Center and the accessibility to everything I needed was great. The staff were very friendly and they were able to get me a room earlier than expected at no additional charge. I would highly recommend this for business travel!
40,Great location service wasn’t as good this trip nobody seemed to have much customer service skills but I don’t use the hotel down stairs that much as I like to explore from this location. Overall I enjoyed the trip and would visit again.
50,One one the best stays I had. Beautiful hotel and casino. Rooms were very nice and clean. And the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable! Everything was great! Definitely will be coming back to stay!
50,We had a wonderful experience and cannot wait to go back. The front desk was extremely helpful with all requests and every staff member greeted us with a smile. The pool was perfect and the food was great!
30,Used to love the Mirage but it doesn't have the same wow factor it used to. The plus side for me was all the friendly staff all very sweet plus for the most part my room was very quiet. And the djs at the pool were awesome--great mashups! But my room itself was disappointing for the money feel I got taken a bit. It was a nice size room but very dated with odd furniture plus the bed wasn't comfy with very thin bedcovers no microwave no fridge and especially awful for me no coffee maker. Had no way to keep bottles of water cold or heat up coffee bought first thing every morning at the Coffee Bean downstairs BTW their breakfast burritos are the bomb. So yummy. Just got the feeling greed has taken over in place of offering guests standard amenities that would normally come with a hotel pricetag like this. For my first post pandemic trip I'm so disappointed the Mirage is no longer how I remembered. The whole Vegas experience was sort of an extension of this room for me won't be back.
10,This use to be the perfect hotel for me tropical and clean. But this last stay Darren made it horrible. His attitude and lack of professionalism. Maybe properly train him on the policies of the hotel instead of him trying to cite them after only being there for 4 months.
50,Great location on the strip. Clean rooms and helpful staff. A good choice of restaurants. The casino is well ventilated so the smoking wasn’t too bad. The conference area was large and the meals were good.
10,I will never stay at the Mirage again. It very much was a motel experience. The air conditioning unit was broken and no one assisted. The mini bar was also broken and when it was reported to the hotel they sent a bulky mini refrigerator and left it in the middle on the floor. I’ll never book the Mirage again! I ALSO DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!!
10,Other than electricity running water and close to the event I have nothing positive to say. The room was from 1980. Housekeeping left dirty towels and bobby pins in room another guests. The ceiling had brown streaks on it. There are 0 electric outlets near the bed to plug in your phone/electronic. The bathroom was a joke. There is no standing/walk in shower as it was tub/shower. The tub looked like I was going to contract a disease. The hot water lasted for at most 5 minutes. The blower dryer was broken. I got all of this for the cheap price of what $300/night? What a steal!
50,Friendly staff and well maintained grounds. Casino/hotel had everything we needed. DJ at the pool played great music for all ages. Good food and drinks. Had a great view of the volcano from the room. A classic.
20,First day Found knife near sink  Second day Found long hair in tub and reported it to security. It was frightening.... felt really weird... who would go into my hotel room nd leave me a knife?  Nobody from staff reached out.
30,Overall experience was ok besides the tv didn’t work and bathtub drains water very slow. By the time finish showering tub is about 1/3 full. Staff was very friendly beside the person at the front desk on the day of check out was very rude and seems like does not want to help.
20,This property is in severe need to upgrade all their room door hinges so that the room doors do not SLAM shut and vibrate the room door you are staying in. Seems the doors don't fit snuggly ( 1/12-2 inches at the bottom of the door to the floor gap) 1/2 inch on the side of the door where it closes.    It's too bad as everyone at the property from front Desk Housekeeping Slot floor and Bellman were all great and deserve two thumbs up for customer service however listening to slamming doors every night at all hours of the night is less than desirable.
10,We booked a 2 Queen room and got a king bed so they changed at check in to a handicap accessible room and it had old carpet on the wall for decor  a view of parking lot in the 2 queen bed room and a fridge you can’t use and old screw fell off bathroom door and cut hand
20,Nothing surprising here everything is just about getting your money. Every time you turn around more charges. And nothing is priced reasonably fair at all. But this is the experience you get with MGM resorts on the strip
40,I travel 50% for work; this was a personal trip for reunion with friends. The Mirage is well maintained overall with solid amenities (great pool!) but slightly dated. We had comfortable rooms but again not the most updated decor (not really important…just being honest!) The staff was exceptional. From A to Z we found everyone welcoming friendly and very accommodating. Location on the Strip is perfect if that’s what you’re looking for; great attractions easily within walking distance. Solid Vegas value! No complaints.
50,Stayed here several times this is a great resort and was the first to be built on the strip back in 1992 so it has history and charm. The serrvers at the Stack restaurant were exceptional we were there for 2 meals and they were very knowledgeable and professional.
50,Easy to check in with the app. Used our phones as room key. No lines to wait in was a huge bonus. We checked in before we got there and then downloaded the key while we were on the way. You can get an actual room key if you want one as well.  Very clean hotel. Comfortable beds. We had windows to the back but it was fine because it’s still open and doesn’t feel closed in. You can still see out far away even though you’re overlooking partial roof. Pool area was nice perhaps a little too busy for my taste but we didn’t spend much time there. They had a dj playing dance music so that was fun. The dolphin show is not running right now but the secret garden was open. We did not visit The Secret Garden.  Location is excellent. It’s close to Caesar’s The Linqs and Treasure Island.  Very nice. I would book again.
40,The hotel itself is ok but feels very dated. The rooms are large which is important but feel tired. I understand it is about to be updated and converted to a Hard Rock Cafe. This is good. The staff on the whole were very good. Check in and check out were easy
10,The room was dirty. Run down. Hair in bathroom upon check in. Shower disguising and stopped up. Toilet stopped up. Towels did not seem clean. Smelled like mildew. Had to request new towels. Room needy dated. Air was not working properly. Very hot in the room
50,I love staying at The Mirage the staff is very friendly and helpful. Making the stay and gaming experience a great time! The hotel is clean and safe and offers a variety of food options. The pool area and grounds are beautiful and relaxing.
50,This was a very beautiful hotel well designed. The aquarium especially was a highlight. The lobby was very busy but despite that the hotel personnel all remained friendly. Great location to explore from.
50,Have not stayed here before. Was a little worried after reading some reviews. But…  Everyone that we encountered was EXTREMELY helpful and friendly- cleaning staff lobby staff bell staff. Pool beautiful. Tons of chairs at pool. Ate at Stack- delicious (but pricey.). Rooms spacious and very clean. Great location near: linq Caesars Harrahs TI Bellagio . Would stay here again without hesitation!!!!
50,"After all these years the place that started it all is still king. Mirage was the spark for the ""new"" Vegas back in the 90's and the place is still as good now as it was then. From the aquarium behind the check-in desk to the iconic Volcano it epitomizes Vegas."
40,First time I've stayed at the Mirage in years. This is where I always stayed when I was a frequent Vegas visitor in the 90's and 00's. I was pleasantly surprised to see it has maintained its charm the quality of its services was quite nice and everything was clean unlike a couple of other casinos I visited over my stay. I forgot how much fun Vegas can be and I look forward to visiting again soon and plan to stay again at the Mirage.
40,Great stay at the Mirage. In town for a conference at another hotel. Opted to stay at the Mirage based on the reviews of both hotels. Relatively easy check-in. Room was at the quiet end of a long hallway on the 20th floor facing west. Good views of the mountains and no strip noise. Clean and spacious room. Good water pressure in the shower. Opted for no housekeeping for my 3 day stay but the HK staff were very nice. Ordered room service for breakfast each day. Fast service and love that everything came in disposable containers. No nasty dishes and trays to deal with. Friendly delivery staff - Doo remembered that I was traveling with a friend in an adjoining room. Impressive given the number of guests in the hotel. Hotel services were good - stores restaurants pool. Check-out was fine. Mentioned an erroneous mini-bar charge on my bill expecting a discussion. No questions asked the charges were removed. This was my 5th trip to Vegas in 18 years. Each time I expect it to be my last. Have stayed off and on strip most recently at a fancier place just down the strip. This stay was the best. If I return will definitely consider the Mirage.
50,Just got back from a 4 night stay at the Mirage and even though it is scheduled to change hands they are not skimping on the service for the visitor's and they are keeping it very clean. Nice location on the strip also...
40,The Mirage is a fantastic resort near the center of the strip that I feel often gets overlooked for some of the glitzier properties. Sitting across from both Harrah's and the Venetian and adjacent to Caesars there is plenty to do within a short walk.    The Resort and Casino itself is very relaxing with that indoor outdoor tropical charm from the palm trees and waterfalls. The casino has a nice energy and flow to it with several nice dining options lining the floor. The pool is large and relaxing as well for some fun in the sun.    As for the rooms they are large and comfortable with the only down side being smaller bathrooms where only one person can really get ready in them at a time.    Overall a perfect spot center strip that won't break the bank and not to mention the place smells really good.
40,I did not have any issues checking in early. The staff was accomodating when I asked questions. I did not like the fact I smelled smoke in my room and all throughout the hotel casino and shops. But I guess all of the hotels are that way.
10,There is nothing special about this place. It is dated dirty smells and has an insane policy where you can’t use the fridge in your room. Many better resorts. Maybe some are MGM but I intend to avoid all the MGM resorts
40,The location of the hotel is very convenient and the staff we encountered were very friendly and upbeat. The room was comfortable and I had more than enough space (double queen). The bathroom was a little dirty and some areas behind the beds showed some visible trash from a previous stay. But I can imagine that staffing shortages and a rebound in travel has made it difficult to keep up.    Overall solid stay and would consider coming back to this hotel.
40,I was at the Mirage for a conference. The conference facilities were great and the meals there were really good. My room was OK but was starting to show its age. That being said I did have a very nice trip and would return again.
40,We stayed here to be close to everything on the strip. It was a perfect location. Love the pool! We rented pool chairs for $75 each(so expensive) and they were great. front row to the pool with an umbrella and side table. The server was wonderful super friendly and attentive.
10,Hotel was sold so they are not taking care of it. Current condition is horrible. Stay somewhere else. Bathroom shower floor was dirty stained. Shower head leaked. Door did not close all the way. Towels were threadbare. Room carpet was dirty. Made mistake of not wearing socks and my feet were black
20,I rarely write review. I stayed at mirage over the holiday week 10/7-10/9.  Their in-room dining is only from 1 restaurant while there are multiple restaurants in the hotel. So I had no choice but to offer it .  First night was fine. Second night steak was well done when ordered medium rare fruits are mostly bad.    Bathroom and pillows aren't that clean.    Bell Desk. I checked in a bag pack and they put the word fragile on it . However things were damaged. Unacceptable. Its a metal bottle and they manage to dent it.. not sure how .
30,The property? 9/10 - pools casino staff - all great & capture old-school Vegas vibes.    The rooms? 4/10. Ripped carpet seams down every hallway. Clogged shower AND sink. Very tired rooms need updated.
20,This hotel is in need of updating. The tub had rust around the drain. You could see the grout on the floor around the toilet was yellow and brown pretty gross (you can get stained grout clean but you have to clean it and not just wipe it) The hard surfaces where cracked in places and that is what we get as an MGM rewards member? Sad. We also were supposed to get a room upgrade and this is it? The hostess: Ana Sanchez in the Pantry Restaurant had an attitude when I asked her why they were cleaning all the other tables first before cleaning the one we were waiting for and the only party waiting for a table? The Snacks restaurant had luke warm coffee for 3 mornings and didn’t seem to care when we told them about it. Most of the restaurants were closed Monday & Tuesday during our stay so we will probably not stay here again. It use to be nice here years ago but not anymore. Only reason for 2 stars was the location and checking into our room through the app even though it wouldn’t let my husband use his phone half the time…they need to address that among many other things this place needs to address!
10,My husband and I decided to extend our Wedding Anniversary celebration trip in Vegas and choose the Mirage based on the beautiful waterfall inside the hotel and the volanco show. Unfortunately our awe and the beauty of the hotel stopped there. We were woken up around 7:00am  by a LOUD clashing sound on our window. When he opened the blinds we saw two ropes that CONTINUALLY clashed against the window causing us to be unable to return to sleep. It sounded like someone was trying to break into our window. When I contacted the front desk they confirmed it was the window washer and only offered to remove the resort fee. My question is why would any guest be placed in a room where they'd be woken up to LOUD banging on their window early in the morning? For this reason I would never recommend the Mirage hotel and am deeply disappointed overall our experience.
40,My husband and I had a very pleasant stay at the Mirage. Every staff member we encountered was very friendly. I wish the bed was a bit softer but the rooms were well equipped and very clean. There was a great choice of restaurants as well.
30,Front counter service was good at check in but hottest checkout. The overall quality is not great and given that it is a casino/hotel means that the noise levels are very high. This is not the best venue for conferences.
50,We loved this property. We wanted to stay here since we both have never stayed here and heard they were sold to the Hard Rock .    We received an amazing room upgrade which seemed like a once in lifetime room upgrade for us. Staff was amazing from the bell desk to the casino floor. Casino did real well at keeping the smoke smell down too which is great for us since we both are not smokers.
30,When we arrive there was food in the frig from the previous guest (the frig is the kind where if you take something out or move something you get charged)  carpet had a red spill of some sort that would rub off with paper towel but needed to be cleaned. They gave us a little credit ($100 credit toward room purchases) and offered to sent up housekeeping so we agreed. We went and gambled and returned to room but it had not been cleaned in that time frame (several hours) so we deferred cleaning until checkout. There is NO COFFEE NO MICROWAVE NO REGULAR FRIG in the rooms. Coffee is $4-$5 a cup. Brought our own coffee maker (Walgreen's) and coffee (cheaper and more convenient than going down to get coffee several times a day) Wish room had been cleaned BEFORE we checked in. Staff was friendly. Beatle show was terrific food at the restaurants' was delicious. Good time!
50,I went to the Mirage to celebrate my 50th birthday along with my girlfriend and my best friend from childhood and his wife. Everything during my stay at the Mirage made the trip amazing. The Mirage is an amazing place with a very friendly and helpful staff. Everyone I encountered from the staff greeted me and made me feel very welcomed there.
50,Purchased basic two Queen room on Expedia along with Spirit Air flights. Check in easy our room was adequate.  Asked for & received medical fridge which barely kept anything cold. Slept two nights in this room. In the second night noticed there was a drip from the light on the bathtub. The next morning we let them know and they insisted we move due to this being a possible electrocution hazard. They upgraded us to a Penthouse Suite and waived our resort fees (although I was charged one night of resort fees). That suite was WOW for sure. 1250+ square feet with everything you could want and more including a nice fridge we could actually use living room dining room bedroom and the largest bath area I’ve ever seen. Thank you Millie for taking care of us! It was amazing!
40,One of the only hotels I have ever been able to get a good nights sleep. Very comfortable beds. I could get the room dark and there was very little noise from adjoining rooms. The app check in and check out worked perfect and the room key kiosk were fast and easy.
50,We had to make two reservations since the king room we wanted was only available two of the three nights we were staying. We were told (when we originally made the reservations) we were going to have to change rooms on the last day. Well the gentleman who checked us in was able to combine our reservations and made it so we would not need to switch rooms at all. All of the staff in general was very friendly and helpful. The room was nice and very clean. The only thing I had hoped for was a mini fridge in the room that we could actually use to store food or drinks (the one in the room is part of the mini bar so it really can’t be touched unless you want to pay).
20,We reserved 3 identical rooms a month in advance when we arrived late in the afternoon it took one of the rooms an extra 3 hours to be ready and they still didn’t give us the room we had reserved. Contacted front desk about it and was told that the resort fee would be removed to make up for the inconvenience that never happened and instead additional charges that could not be explained appeared on my credit card still no resolution.
40,I had a very nice experience at the Mirage Hotel & Casino. I visited the Mirage to attend a Conference. My experience was excellent. The service was great the meals provided at the Conference were very good - much better than other conference meals I have experienced!
50,I stayed here the last leg of my trip and it was the best of the three places I stayed in Vegas!! The room was fantastic with a great view of the strip and the pool was the best way to kill some time in the afternoon with great staffing! The one complaint I have is that the pool closed way too early at 5p.m.
50,Had a great time at the Mirage. Great location we were able to walk to everything no need for a car. I expected the rooms to be more modern but overall we were comfortable. Pool and surrounding areas and landscaping is beautiful. Great trip would go again.
50,Great 2 night stay at the Mirage. Love was excellent and the staff was exceptional. We were upgraded to a suite with no additional charge.The location is perfect and we enjoyed the volcano eruption. Highly recommended.
50,We have stayed at the Mirage many times now over the years and remain totally satisfied with the combination of location value and customer service. Even with the pending management transition it will always be the great Staff that will bring us back.
30,"The location is great. There's a lot of variety nearby it's easy to find something that matches your interests and mood.    In terms of the amenities you're paying an above average rate for rooms that are only decent. Rooms are dated and not well maintained. Bathroom door was painted over in ""landlord special"" style. Bathroom fan was builder-grade trash that you couldn't have a conversation over. Beds are comfy room was tidy and pretty spacious. There are no bedside outlets to charge a device; all we had were 2 USB-A ports in the clock radio. There were two outlets at the desk but they were very close together and nestled in the counter's fascia; you'd be SOL if you had a big bricky charger.    We had a big group 16 people across 5 rooms on 3 floors and every room eventually had trouble with the keycards either getting into their room or getting on elevators.    The staff were awesome. They were helpful and kind even when they were deep in the weeds due to understaffing they went the extra mile.    The dining options were good. Still and Otoro are tasty and convenient. Pantry was also good but seemed to have a big line even when tables were open.    The casino was among the best in the immediate area. Good variety of games lots of tables open and reasonable table minimums. Once or twice we found ourselves a little frustrated that they kept dealers at completely empty tables while there were people idling at other games waiting for a seat.    The pools were good. Lots of chairs lots of space and a good vibe. Poolside drinks were pretty good though a few people in our group found their margaritas unpalatable I was happy with mine.    They were far more stingy about sending drinks to gamblers than most other casinos and they'd sometimes just shout from a few tables away to see if anyone wanted a drink rather than come by and ask personally. I felt like I must have done something to upset them but other people at different tables with different servers reported the same thing.    The shops were good. A lot of it is the same stuff you could get anywhere but the fashionistas in our group all found some unique things they liked.  I was a little put off that everything from the boutiques to the convenience stores on site had no prices. I know when it comes to high end retail this is common; you're selling the good not the price. But it's just tacky when it comes to sunscreen and Diet Coke."
50,Great location clean friendly staff. Lots of restaurant options room service could have had more options to choose from. Pool was great no issue getting lounge chairs. Check in and check out we’re easy.
50,Having stayed at almost every hotel in Vegas I wanted to stay here before it becomes Hard Rock. Although the hotel is dated a bit the room was spotless and it was better than i expected. Will be interesting to see the change from Mirage to HardRock
50,Casino & hotel rooms are clean staff is very friendly bar service while playing in casino came by often. VIP church in was very quick with no problems casino host was helpful with pickup to and from airport.
40,Nice resort. Strip view room is dated and small but it was clean. Daily house keeping was provided. Excellect customer service on check in. Nice pool area.  Plenty of foid choices unfortunately no buffet. I do recommend the Mirage.  In a couple of years it will become a Hard Rock resort and the volcano will no longer exsist.
40,Great location nice pool great food. Quality entertainment line ups. The casino is mall enough to be able to navigate but large enough for good variety. The pool has a good set up and staff are engaging.
50,Arturo in the Sports Bar was so great we had to stop by there every day of our stay. Hotel staff was friendly and willing to accomodate our every need. Highly recommend the staywell suite if you can work it into your budget.
50,Absolutely gorgeous hotel the grounds and pool especially are spectacular! Really hoping the new management doesn't change too much - the hotel is iconic and FABULOUS as-is!  Thoroughly enjoyed the restaurants STACK and Otoro as well as the breakfast at Paradise Cafe. Gelato from Cocolini was also a highlight. Great fitness room spa was immaculate and quiet and the room was massive - super comfy beds the bathroom was a bit dated but honestly i can't complain.. everything was amazing i would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat.
20,At the end of the strip. Room was hot. Was told that the room air is controlled when you deadbolt door so when you are out of the room and return. The room Is hot and never seems to get cool or cold. When you pay for a late checkout- they deactivate your key for elevator floor access and room access.
50,Awesome get a way for my birthday  Enjoyed food roomservicegolf at Bali hai and gambling. Wish we could get a air discount to come back more. Maybe another trip for us in the near future Thanks for everything
30,Be forewarned large parts of the pool area may be closed for private events. Our room had multiple stains on the furniture and carpet - some permanent. Not sure we would stay at another MGM property.
10,Booked a room and showed up and they told me it wasn’t available. You put me in a room where we had some of our family sleeping on roller beds. The credit you gave us wasn’t what you said it would be so when I called at checkout was told by some obnoxiously rude agent that what I was promised wasn’t possible. I asked for a supervisor and she left me on hold for 30 min and then hung up. Total joke. Will never stay ever again at any MGM resort.
20,Mirage is showing its age with rooms having some broken bathroom fixtures and overall lacking service. We paid for late checkout but were locked out after the normal checkout time. We had to raise with two different front desk folks to resolve. We were promised a refund of the fee but it wasn’t credited when we checked out. While a classic hotel name the property is no longer worth staying at compared to other better quality resorts.
40,Great room at a decent price. The staff is still very friendly but the overall condition of the property was disappointing. Just because you sold/are selling the property you should still have some pride in keeping it looking sharp and neat.
40,Nice Hotel Restaurant prices were extremely high. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Need better access to the rooms from garage parking and front desk. Rooms need refrigerators and micro waves for customers.
50,We stay here every year for a week at a time. We love everything about this place and are sad to see it go. I would suggest to anyone to get in one last trip before it is switched over to the Hard Rock.
50,The staff at the mirage is the friendliest and I don't think I could get such good service anywhere else Everyone was so helpful front the belldesk to the service people who cleaned the rooms I can't say a bad word about anyone
50,Outstanding stay clean hotel rooms and parking is at hand. Near the Caesar’s Bellagio and cosmo very centralized. Wasn’t able to try the food because of other priorities but for sure will do next time.    Need to have more people walking around to offer free drinks.
10,We've stayed at this hotel before we were told it was fully booked and nothing could be done. Lumpy bed flat pillows no coffee not vacuumed very dusty. Hair all over the bathroom and handprints on all the mirrors. Prison has better towels.
30,Hair on the ceiling of the bathroom leaky shower head unknown splatter of some sort on the wall and ceiling behind the nightstand lamp. Carpet dirty thick dust on the trim above the bed. I will say it was quiet on our floor at night which was nice.
50,Stayed 5 nights for both pleasure/business. Our front desk experience was quick/friendly and efficient. We booked a cabana and our server Heather was great! Well worth the money for a cabana rental. Property is clean and well maintained. Really going to miss staying here as the pool and tropical theme cannot be matched anywhere else.
40,Glad we were there to see the Volcano before it’s torn out and changed to the Hard Rock .  This place is beautiful inside and out ..still my favorite place to stay and favorite casino as well. The location makes it an easy walk to everything on the strip . It also smells amazing inside of here  like coconut pineapple and mango all the time
50,Good clean resort room was clean and all staff that we interacted with was very kind. Any issues were promptly taking care of excellent location on the strip. Room was clean and housekeeping was friendly.
50,This was a great experience at the mirage friendly staff and quick service from check in to check out will definitely be back they were very understanding for I had to check out 1 day early because family came in to town and I went to stay 1 night with them. So they are very understanding
50,We arrived early and were greeted by Milly at the registration desk. She asked if we were celebrating anything special during our stay and we told her that our 37th anniversary was in a few days and that we were also celebrating my upcoming birthday. She was so sweet and friendly wishing us happiness for both occasions. Our room was not ready yet but Milly said she would text us just as soon as she had something available. We had the bell desk hold our luggage and went to eat brunch. By the time we finished eating our room was ready. And what a room! Milly had arranged for us to stay in a beautiful suite with a huge living and dining area with powder room. The bedroom had a bathroom with double sinks a soaking tub and separate shower. Thank you Milly!  We had also reserved chairs at the Oasis pool for the next day. Upon checking in we were escorted to our chairs where our towels were spread out for us and our umbrella adjusted. Throughout the day we were treated very well with quick and friendly drink service. The entire pool area is lovely with its tropical vibe and waterfalls but the Oasis pool is a true haven.  Overall our stay was just perfect and we are sad that the Mirage’s days are numbered.
20,Check in service was inept. Manager was rude and too concerned with his hair than being of service. Had to make two trips to front desk even asking if the room was the same as we had reserved. Very sad. Find a different place
40,The Mirage was the host hotel for the conference that I attended which made it a breeze to go to and from the conference. Aside from that the room and bed were very comfortable and you were walking distance from everything on the strip.
50,The staff here are so helpful and friendly. The rooms are clean and well maintained with modern furnishings. There are many excellent restaurants the outdoor areas are beautiful the pool and waterfall are huge and Beatles Love is a must see! A great mid-priced property for families or those looking for a more laid back stay in Vegas.
50,5 days of relaxation in beautifully designed and well maintained surroundings! I will definitely return to this place when I am planning my next trip to Las Vegas! The gaming tables were also favorable $$
50,Although we had a problem with our room initially the front desk was very accommodating in switching our room even though it was late at night. The location of the hotel is very convenient and I enjoyed the slots.
10,The rhumbar for years has been the place to gather catch up with friends have a good time with a cocktail and a cigar. Now it’s so loud and so uncomfortable and so disappointing. One of the reason our company stays at the Mirage is because of the rhumbar being outside with a comfortable atmosphere. If you’re looking for a place with very loud rap/dj driven music this is your place.
40,good hotel overall small issues like ac wasn't working the best and found pool area tight for space. pool opened too late in the morning (9am) was a huge lineup every day. 4 0ut 5 star i give. Was just small stuff
30,Room wasn't up to standard and they wouldn't change us. Too close to the volcano so it was loud and it was dirty. We literally had to hear the volcano going off all night until midnight I think. The floor was really dirty as well - I don't think the carpets were vacuumed at all.
50,We had a great time in Vegas at the Mirage. All of the staff were friendly and kind. Our room was amazing with a great view of the city. I would recommend Mirage to anyone that is going on a business trip or vacation.
40,Smaller than it looks but plenty of Big Value.  Make sure you realize the AC are eco-friendly and turn off if your deadbolt is not on. The pool was great the casino is small but have everything you need. Make sure you see Shin Lim while you’re there.
50,Mini Vacation mainly to see cirque Love. Came away very favorable of the hotel and it's staff. Food was a little pricey but what in Vegas isn't? Great location easy to get in and out. Gambling table minimums to high for this Midwesterner but otherwise everything was great.
50,The mirage was very clean great customer service i love the pool area! Very family fun friendly. I definitely recommend. I will be coming back soon. The food was delicious and the ice cream shop had great ice cream
50,Mirage staff was great and location was very good. Restaurants were clean and food was excellent. The room was very clean and had everything that was needed for a pleasant and relaxing stay. Would defiantly stay there again
50,The Mirage is still a beautiful property after all these years. One of the best pools in Vegas immaculate grounds and very friendly service. Though the buffet is unfortunately gone there is still a good mix of restaurants. Overall a very nice stay.
50,Good service location food and housekeeping. We especially liked the food at the Pantry. The conference center was just large enough without being too spread out. We were able to walk to most other venues we wanted to see. Easy taxi service for farther venues.
30,No happy shouting or laughing while people are in this casino. Extremely hard to win here if you win anything at all. What a contrast to some of the other older or smaller casinos right near by! And this casino and throughout the hotel is freezing blowing cold. Wear a sweater or long sleeves if you expect to gamble or stand in line somewhere. This casino is a drag.    We stayed 3 nights. Comfortable room but no coffee machine! How rude. Instead you are expected to run down to the lobby in the morning and stand in a long line for Starbucks. NOT what I want to do first thing in the am.  Line ups for the main restaurants and some specialties. That is for breakfast lunch and supper service. Ridiculous. Want you to scan a code to get on the wait list so you won't have to stand over an hour! Ridiculous. Walk across the street and find food and drink immediately at the LINQ Promenade of restaurants. This lining up for food at the Mirage was incredibly annoying and a waste of our short holiday time!    If you want a chair at the pool LINE UP! Get there by 9 am to get in that line too. Line snakes back around through convention center. Otherwise you'll be sitting on the concrete near the pool. No shade for anyone except those who pay more. That means sitting in the direct sun for as long as you are there. Nice little restaurant there with no line up except at lunch. Perhaps that is because they provide chair side service too. Very friendly staff. Try the French toast!    There is a snack or light meal type place across from the Mexican restaurant. Good by greasy sandwiches. Desserts look good but are dull and seem very mass produced. Mexican restaurant was friendly but our food was cold.    Food and beverage prices? Higher than I had expected. Ate at a more reasonable price with variety and hot fresh food at various places on the Strip.    No entertainment in the lobby. If you wander down one hallway you'll find the RHUMBA Lounge indoor/outdoor lounge with a singer. No mention of this anywhere in the casino or lobby to draw you there.    No matter where you go in the Mirage it is noisy noisy noisy. Thank God the rooms are soundproofed. Soon as you hit the elevators and lobby the sound of people crescendos. As does the smoke.
40,The Mirage is looking a little worn perhaps with the sale of the hotel they are not bothering to invest in the property. The pool is beautiful surrounded by palm trees and foliage which provide for nice shade during the scorching daytime temps. Staying in the west wing leaves you with an unsightly view of the back hotel guess you need to splurge for a front view of the strip.
10,Over all room looked clean upon arrival and we dropped our stuff and left to walk the strip. Came back at about 11pm and was getting ready to relax for the night. As we pulled the covers off the bed to get comfy there was a panty liner with hair on the sheet! On a bed that should’ve been cleaned and disinfected. So disgusted never again. I’ll stick to my hiltons and pay for a Uber. I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt of what people would say about the hotels on the strip and give it a opportunity but wow
50,The resort feeling hits you as you pull up and then continues as you walk thru the atrium. Music is great the casino is fun! Don't miss it! Had absolute fantastic meals both steak houses Heritage and the Stack and a wonderful meal at Otoro.
50,Did a 5 night stay one of the best hotel/pool layouts on the Strip for convenience and ease of access. Pool area cannot be beat. The Pantry breakfasts outstanding pool food delivered to chair great hot and great tasting. Housekeeping was excellent all days and timely on cleaning of rooms. Have gone to Mirage many years and will continue to come back.
30,Better than most but not exceptional. Reasonable value for money. On site dining options were middle to low end. Higher end options exist at competing establishments nearby. Volcano exhibit was a real let down not worth waiting in the crowd surrounded by undesirable elements.
40,I really enjoy the smell of the Mirage when you walk in other Casinos smell dirty or musty or smoky but the Mirage smells tropical and like coconut. It’s refreshing after a plane ride or long walk on the strip.
50,We rented a two-queen room for three girls for 4-days then three separate king rooms for three nights consecutively. Everything was organized and very clean! Paying for a fridge seems ridiculous!! The oool is amazing!! Staff was very friendly. The location of the hotel is awesome!!! Eat at Denny’s for breakfast as the Pantry is way overpriced!! Our girlfriend’s 50th birthday was the best because of the ease of stay at this hotel!!!
10,I would like a full refund the entire stay. I am not happy with the service provided by anyone. You think good voucher will fix the nasty tub I had to use and the dirty carpet I had to step on. As well as the dirty towels and bedsheets.
40,Stayed at the end of September for a week. Loved the hotel. Excellent location and close to Caesars Palace where the conference was. Check in very quick and room very comfortable and clean. Air conditioning not do great. Swimming pool excellent alongside the rum bar and of course the stills craft bars and eats. All staff very friendly. Glad I stayed before the change.
40,Really enjoyed this girls' trip with my niece. Nice sized room with two queens. Next time I will request volcano view. Housekeeping does a beautiful job. Mila (sp? Pronounced Mee-luh) Massage therapist at the spa is fantastic. Check-in and MGM Rewards staff were very nice. Get there before the Hard Rock takes over. Secret Garden was closed during our stay. If you plan to visit the garden check status before reserving a room.
50,From check in we felt very welcomed. The food and casino game selections are great. Staff all over are very nice and helpful. Very accessible location with nearby restaurants and bars. Would definitely recommend this hotel again.
40,Great pool area with multiple bars. Tables had good minimums and the location is good on the strip. Plenty of restaurants to choose from quick and easy to something a little more upscale. Hotel also had shops and extras
40,Outdoor space was great. Indoor is a bit dated and everything is expensive. Same cost for dinner at the Bellagio not same quality. No in room amenities like coffee or bottled water. Not even a refrigerator. If you store anything in the mini bar fridge they charge you. If you touch anything in the mini bar…they charge you.
40,Nice location staff were really helpful and went up and beyond at times to make our stay a memorable one. Rooms are a little old looking need a fresh lick of paint. Bathrooms are small if you don’t like soap make sure you bring your own shower gel.
50,Mirage is still a friendly well kept and maintained property with great food entertainment and gaming options.  We have come here several times and never been disappointed.  Great friendly people at the check in and check out areas - if you don’t choose the electronic version.
20,Nice pool. That's about all I can say. Dealers and tables were sub par. The dealer had 3 miss deals. Also one didnt know how to check me in at the table for my membership. The next dealer had no problem. Room had issues and slight smell. Staff was not helpful. Overall was a let down for our group.
10,Overall we were disappointed with the cleanliness and customer service at the Mirage. For the price point you can expect clean rooms and friendly staff. You also expect to be able to check in at the time that is stated.
50,The hotel was very clean and well kept. The hotel is centrally located on the strip and it is good to be in walking distance of other places. The hotel has an amazing dolphin adoption area. The grand ball was like nothing I had ever seen it was breath taking. I would recommend you try it out!
10,Disappointed is an understatement. The rooms were extremely small. They were also dirty and dingy. The outlets were inconveniently located in the room. My room was not cleaned on one of the days. I was completely skipped over without any explanation. The amenities are subpar to say the least. The only plus is the location to other nice casinos within walking distance. Will not return!
40,Overall this hotel offers lots of options for entertainment dining drinks and shops. What didn't make this a 10 is the room- needs upgrades. Bathroom is small dated falling a bit apart. Needs remodel. But the bed is super comfortable and overall was quite clean so I could get over the need for remodel.
40,Went to Las Vegas for a conference. Stayed at The Mirage because the conference was there as well. Overall a nice place to stay. The room was on the 15th floor with a nice view. The room was very quiet I was actually surprised at how quiet the room was. The conference facilities were very nice and comfortable overall. The staff was nice and courteous. My only complaint is that smoking is allowed on the casino floor. You have to walk through the casino to get to most places (from the front to the rooms and from the room to the shops and restaurants. That would be the only thing I could say I did not like.  Overall a great stay!
40,The Mirage is a lovely hotel with good restaurants (pricey; but then again it is Las Vegas) and convenient to other attractions. Love the Beatles show...could watch it several times over and still go back for more!
10,The staff at the Mirage were rude or seemed to not want to work. I know everyone has bad days I work in customer service for over 10 years but are you telling me that every employee at the Mirage was having a bad day over the whole weekend?    The rooms were not properly cleaned from the previous guest.    Just overall a bad first stay at the Mirage and as a Golf MGM rewards member who vacations in Las Vegas very often it will be my last.
40,Overall good experience during our stay at the Mirage. Some deep cleaning needs to occur behind the night stand. The display of snacks could be an issue with children. Guest should have the option of removing the weighted tray.
50,The Mirage continues to be a fun and comfortable place to stay in Las Vegas. Clean great staff good restaurant choices and lots to do on the property. Enjoyed our three night stay and always love staying at the Mirage.
40,Attended a nursing education conference in Sept. conference area was pleasant and clean. There are many restaurants and a convenient coffee shop.  Rooms a average but clean with good views. It would be nice to have a place by the bed to plug in your phone.
30,I was there for a conference and I’m not the target audience for this sort of experience. The resort smelled like an ashtray inside and out and it was constant loud music. I’m pretty sure that’s what some people are going for.
40,The staff made my stay excellent. Every department had staff that were wonderful to have assisting me during my stay. The rooms need to be updated in several ways. The food at the restaurants (that were open) was excellent.
10,Check in was smooth when we got into our room we found a bug crawling in the bed by the pillow. We immediately guest services with no apologies nor resolution. We ended up changing our room however the new room was also very dusty. Cleanliness of this hotel is absolutely disgusting. We went down to front desk to see if we could have our service fee waived for the inconvenience agent was talking to MOD Fatima who refused to give us any resolution as they had to wait for the investigation of possible bed bug. Still no apologies we had to follow up again on our check out date.
10,Unless you intend to stay at the pool your entire stay then don't stay here.this hotel needs to be gutted and rebuilt but just buy some new carpet if you arent willing to do that! Perhaps it was a great place in the 1970s.
50,Great service smiling faces and polite staff is all I experienced at the Mirage. Great atmosphere and an awesome sportsbook to lounge and bet at. The Heritage steak house was amazing too. Its a must try dining experience when you stay here. Lines were always short so I know they were well staffed. Pool was great!
10,The hotel room has drinks and snacks in the refrigerator for sale. I never touched either of them and was still charged $80 for drinks and snacks i never drank or ate. I would rather stay at treasure island and not have to even worry about this.
50,Stayed here for a conference and had a great experience. Great accommodations great food options...never had to leave the resort. Everything is pricy but that is the same at all the resorts...so no fault there.
10,I would choose different hotel if i ever come back to las vegas and stay within mgm hotels.  I like the location but not the hotel however i do like the panty restaurant for breakfast because it was convenient for us to stay at the hotel and the food was good even they are pricey but hey it s convenient!
20,"My husbands wallet was stolen right out of our hotel room. There was no money in it and no real reason to steal it. When I called the security department I was answered with no emotion and was told ""we will ask the housekeeper on duty that day if she took it"". Really?!"
20,I actually stayed 4 days at Planet Hollywood and 4 days at Mirage. When comparing the two the PH room was twice the size and nicer (I got both rooms comped so money wasn't a factor but I think the pricing is similar). The pool at Mirage is much better. Also the sportsbook at Mirage is much better (I actually watched football at Mirage even though I was staying in PH over the weekend). I also received way better comps for my gambling at PH. Finally for two of the four days at Mirage my room wasn't cleaned even though were were out of the room most of the day.
50,I had a short business trip to Las Vegas. The conference was at the mirage and easy to navigate. I am not the going out type so it was nice to have 24 access to multiple food options and well as shows at the facility.  The staff were all very nice. Not huge on the smoking in the casino but it is what it is. I think it would be nice to have an area where business persons that need to check out but still have conferences could go to work between sessions.
50,Enjoyable but quite pricey stay. Enjoyed Beatle show with excellent seating.  It was quite difficult to get around on scooters.  Excellent cocktails but they were quite expensive.  Gift shop items prices were reasonable.
50,Wanted to stay one last time before the big change over. Wasn’t dissatisfied with anything! The staff is friendly and helpful! Rooms were clean and check in was easy on the app. The adult only pool cabana is a must if you can!
30,The staff was friendly. However the facilities are terribly dated and the bathrooms were dated small with definite plumbing issues.The air conditioning in my room was underperforming and they don’t have fans available for the rooms. Also there were very few amenities.
40,The hotel is looking tired for sure. We had a water mark on the ceiling of our room and saw broken floor tiles.  The restaurants have great food and staff is amazing. Loved the oasis pool although the prices didn’t match what was online.  I’m sure the hotel has good bones just needs a makeover.
10,Room charges for use of refrigerator.  Ice maker did not work on our floor.  Restaurant manager did not honor coupon that another staff member gave me and my friends. Manager stated that the staff member was supposed to write on the coupon how many the coupon was good for… the coupon stated “up to 4 people”…!!!
40,Our room was spacious and afforded us a good night's rest. The location is top notch. Common areas are clean and classy. And I love Siegfried & Roy's Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat. Such a sweet space or respite in the center of Vegas. Service was also very good.
30,Attended a conference in this hotel. I was disappointed by the room and the number of drunks stumbling on and off the elevators. The location is central for the strip (I think) the staff was very nice and if you are in a nugget I think this might be your place. If f you like coffee service in your room more personal amenities and a more luxurious surrounding overall try the Wynn.
50,The combination of class comfort cost and location at The Mirage is unrivaled on the Strip. There is a reason we've stayed there twelve times in a row despite exploring and pricing other hotels almost every time we've traveled to Vegas.
40,Always enjoy being at The Mirage whether staying overnight or just visiting. Cannot help but think of the Vegas Vacation movie when there. I've seen just about every show on the strip (at least once) and can say without hesitation The Beatles LOVE by Cirque du Solei is my most favorite. The casino is extremely smoky and I never have much luck there but that's the name of the game. Looking forward to seeing how things move forward with the purchase by the Seminole Tribe and oversight by The Hard Rock. If the services and ambiance is anything close to The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Hollywood FL - I'm all in!
40,The location is great it is in the middle of the strip. Right across a McDonald’s if you want a cheaper meal. Walking distance to the other hotels. Our room is in the lower level and our view is the highway Trump hotel and Treasure Island. During check in we were asked if we are celebrating anything and we told them we are celebrating our 20th Wedding Anniversary we thought we will get an upgrade or at least a room with a nice view. The room is clean and beds are comfortable at least. There is a smell everytime we get in the room almost like stagnant chlorine water smell. No fridge in the room and if you want one you have to pay extra. The pool closes at 6pm which I think too early since the weather was still in the 90s.
10,I did not get the type of room I paid for. The first room I checked was unhabitable due to the overwhelming excessive smell of cleaning applications. Could not breathe. They moved me to a smaller room on a lower floor that was dirty and smelled like fried foods. I checked out and never stayed the night nor will I ever go back again.
20,It was a poor experience from the beginning. When we made our reservation on the MGM website the booking special was for a free upgrade to our room. When we got to our room we called the front desk and were told we were booked in a resort king room. We went back to the front desk to ask about our free upgrade they said they could see the it on the booking and they would move us to another room. Why did the first front desk person we spoke to not see the upgrade? When we made it back up to the second upgraded room it was filled with cigarette smoke and the TV was turned on where someone had obviously been in that room recently. So of course we went right back to the front desk for a third time now and were told there were no more rooms available at that time and that we would have to wait for another room or we could pay more and be moved into a suite. If a suite was available why would that not have been the free upgrade? Next we were advised that we would have to go outside to leave our bags with the bell hop desk. When I asked if he could call the bell hop desk the front desk person just walked away. At that point we were given a new room but why was it not available before? So we went back up again to our 3rd room this time to find that it was the same room we were given initially before we moved. Now we were so exhausted and tired of changing rooms we ended up just settling on a resort king room with no view instead of going back to the front desk a 4th time to try and get the correct room. During all of this we realized at some point during all of the up and down my wife lost her cell phone which would probably not have happened if we had been given the correct room in the first place! Why is a free upgrade offered on a booking if you are not going to see it at check in?
20,Reserved the hospitality suite. Was told suite was ready but the connector room was locked. Had to call down to have my room unlocked. After waiting 30 mins I just left hoping they would eventually make my full room available to me. Got back late night and the other half of the room was finally open. Next day only the bedrooms were serviced. Main suite area was completely ignored. Day after day housekeeping did not clean the main room. Empty bottles Buffalo wing bones dirty paper plates cup of ranch dressing left on table for three days…but the bedrooms were cleaned wonderfully. It’s like they ignored the smell garbage and recyclables for three days. Cleaning staff must have ignored all of this as they walked in and out each day. Terribly disappointed. It’s like they were only assigned bedrooms and not the main room so they couldn’t be bothered. Don’t stay here. I feel like there are better hotels to stay at that actually care.
40,I just told my complain about my check out in the previous page and the other issue is they don’t have enough person for beverage service for in casino they don’t have enough ATM machine but these problems are not just for this casino and hotel
50,We stayed for four nights and had a great visit. We love the location in the middle of the strip close to many amenities. Nice fitness center quiet room comfortable bed and good food options. Highly recommend staying here!!
50,I had to stay there one last time and it was a typically wonderful stay. It kills me that this absolutely iconic property is going to be turned into something as anodyne and soulless as a Hard Rock. Talk about a step down.
20,Hotel was not helpful in handling rowdy neighbors despite multiple calls to desk/security. Conference center was roomy but with AV issues that could have easily been avoided with better testing pre-conference. Not impressed.
10,Paying $600 per room for two nights and they couldn’t accommodate us for an electrical issue our computer charger blew up while plugged in. Went downstairs to show the front office and they had no concern whatsoever. Also the elevators stopped working for a good while has to walk around the whole building. The casino smelled real bad or dirty water/ fishy.
50,Check in was a breeze didn’t have to deal with lines. Same for checking out of the hotel super convenient. Room key was on my phone so didn’t have to worry about carrying a key card. Rooms are a good size.
50,I like staying at this hotel because it took me back to when I stayed here with my family. Besides that the hotel is centrally located right in the middle of the strip. Nice ambience here and not that crowded like the other hotels. Staff is friendly and the dine in options are good.
40,Used to be my go to hotel some years back…still like the property but limited on the slots that I personally like so I didn’t venture off to other properties for gambling…table games too crowded and one of the staff me never had a bad attitude teaching me how to play.
40,Poor water pressure in shower dated rooms. No cheap/fast food options. Sigfried and Roy exhibit and dolphin cove was closed. Staff was friendly. Good location. Ride share pick up location was convenient
50,Had a wonderful stay at the Mirage. Staff restaurants casino rooms and the best pool in Vegas were all great. The property is older but still well maintained and much easier to navigate than the larger newer properties. I will not like to see it leave the MGM Family.
10,The Mirage is showing its age. It is old dingy smoking and rundown. Our room needed a remodel badly and had a pretty bad odor. The bathroom porcelain was pealing of of the tub and there is no usable fridge for convenience.
40,"We have been staying at the Mirage for 30+years and wanted to get in a last trip or two before the new property owner takes over and we have to find a new ""home"". We were concerned since MGM announced the sale that the property may be neglected. It was not at all.. Beautiful grounds nice rooms comfortable beds. Casino was clean machines were available and working restaurants were open and staffed. The pool is the BEST pool on the strip. While weekends do bring the crowds I highly recommend spending the extra money to pre-reserve the premium seating. If you book early enough you will pay less.. Well worth it and they include an umbrella and cushioned chair AND you do not have to worry about getting a chair after waiting in line for the pool to open Yes that pool line is a thing so be prepared.. it is worth it but gets old. Once you get into your reserved chair you forget about the cost..The comfort and view are worth every penny.. book early.. Pool servers are quick and friendly Prices of drinks are Vegas average. (Bring a Yeti cup) or your expensive drink will be hot in minutes.. Lunch menus poolside or dine in at the poolside restaurant with has a nice selection of menu items and serves breakfast all day. We spend a lot of time at the pool so if thats your thing then The Mirage is your place.. at least for now"
40,The room did not keep outside noise or hallway noise out. Had trouble with things waking me up. Good location clean rooms . Sports book was enjoyable. CPK was not to long food was good . Snacks had large portions.
50,Took a trip to the Mirage Casino in Las Vegas and we had a great time. The rooms were average but the staff all around the Casino were super friendly and nice. Liz at the Center Bar was really nice and friendly. Gave us great drink selection. Good place to watch the football games as it wasn’t crowded. Check in and check out we’re extremely quick and the front desk staff were friendly and helpful.  Valet people were just as nice but it did take a while to get our vehicle. Good times.
50,This was our first trip to Vegas and the mirage was amazing beautiful property in our minds the best location on the strip excellent staff very clean easy to get around and not a confusing layout just a great resort with a great price
30,Went to celebrate my grandmas birthday. Housekeeping staff was amazing went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed/wanted. Every other area fell flat. We had concierge order a cake for 25 that we could take to dinner outside of the hotel. The cake was delivered without a box. 4 phone calls and 2.5 hrs later we got a box. During the course of our stay we rented a Cabana and 2 daybeds one day and on a separate day we rented a daybed and loungers…. The day we rented the cabana we ran out of water and asked 3 different people to bring water all of them said they would. After waiting a couple of hours we had to go into the pool store and purchase water. With the amount of money spent over just those 2 days you would have thought we could have gotten water. Service at the Mirage leaves sometimes be desired. Very disappointing.
40,We really enjoy the Mirage. The location is awesome. The staff was very friendly helpful and honest. CPK and the Pantry’s food was excellent. Other restaurants to choose from as well giving a great variety.
10,Terrible experience i think you need to train your staff to understand the mirage is a brand whatever’s displayed to the customers represent the brand. I won’t be visiting because I have never been so disrespected my whole life.
40,All the staff was very friendly and helpful. Comfortable and clean room. Good location in the city. Easy access to other hotels and events. Enjoyed the pool. Special feature of Secret Garden and Dolphin experience is fun.
50,"Check in went quickly very short line for the standard check in (no status). Front desk person provided an upgrade to a higher floor based on my Veterans status on MGM rewards. Room was very nice/clean. Bell service was prompt with baggage delivery less than 10 minutes. Food at the ""Still"" was great and the bar staff was friendly. Would stay at the Mirage again."
50,We went for a delayed 60th birthday/Wedding Anniversary after COVID. This hotel….omg! We had an absolute ball. The reception staff were so lovely as were all the staff we had dealings with. The entire reception and ground floor is out of this world and the pool area is great. Busy at the bar but the waiting staff come round fetching and carrying orders so no issues there. Location was great too. The rooms are older but by no means shabby. It’s such a shame it’s closing.
30,"The Hotel inside was beautiful but my room was ""meh"". There was old gum in the most random places ever. The shower spout wouldn't stay up the hardware was not working at all in the shower. There were dings and dents everywhere. One of the beds had a piece of plywood under the mattress which is weird and now what I expected from such a beautiful hotel. The carpet looked like it hadn't been deep cleaned in quite some while as I was sneezing quite a lot. The room was spacious because I think the room was for the handicapped so you would think the room would be in better shape to accommodate those who already struggle."
20,The only blackjack available 24 hours has a 6/5 payout on a blackjack - this is a horrible change to the game that many casinos have started to do. I do not recommend Mirage casino for this reason.  The hotel and pool area are wonderful just don't gamble here.
50,Mirage is beautiful. We had a volcano view room and it provided a different perspective on the eruption. The pool has a great vibe to it. Surrounded by palm trees and waterfalls and great music to keep the energy going. We spent the whole day there. One of the best pools on the strip. Lots of great food options on site and the staff are very friendly and answered all of our questions without judgement. 10/10 would definitely be back.
50,A truly unique and pleasant experience. Have stayed at the Mirage 15 of the last 17 trips to Vegas. Always a very good stay. Sad to see it go. The pool is one of the best on the strip and the Casino is very relaxing and spacious
10,The Mirage is supposed to be one of the nicest hotels in Vegas. But for an exorbitantly high price I got the same quality of service and amenities as any basic motel. How am I supposed to make it to my meetings off the Strip without being able to store my food patronize restaurants at the Vegas hours of 24/7 or access free parking? Not worth the price.
50,Great Location for all budgets:restaurants shopping or gambling. Something for everyone. I can't walk long distances but was able to rest easily between casinos and shopping. Mirage is next to Ceasar's and Treasure Island or basically across from Harrah's and Venetian. Won a little at all casinos. Going back next month..
50,Staff was great— Rooms large comfortable and clean. My area of hotel was quiet. Wish safe in room was bigger.  Wish Casino was non-smoking. Easy check-in & check out. Great restaurant choices and good service.
50,Rooms are very spacious and clean. Bed was very comfortable. All the staff were super friendly. I really like the location. Very walkable to several casinos. Bloody Mary's at the pool were delicious!!
10,Boring. Not clean. Impossible to use WiFi. Wasted money. I will never recommend this place to anyone. Don’t waste your time or money. Not even a good casino. Barely any people. Good options were very limited.
10,I am truly disappointed in the quality of accommodations where I previously loved this hotel. Next time I am going to a show here I will stay elsewhere. Hard bed lumpy pillows blackout curtains did not stay closed so we had to use a clip. If quality is lowered the price should be too.
50,We were in Vegas for a conference but had enough downtime to visit the pool and do some shopping. The restaurants were excellent. And the location is right in the middle of the area we needed to be. Overall a great hotel.
50,Our stay was awesome. Staff was great! Especially our blackjack dealer Mary. Center Bar is so comfortable to hang at and the waitresses were great. Centrally located on the strip and close to our favorite spots like Harrahs and carnival bar.
20,Disappointment for sure compared to previous stays. Certainly not as clean clientele shady casino very smoky few updates to casino slots Every restaurant extremely overpriced. This used to be our favorite but the upcoming sale of the property must have severely impacted the quality.
40,Loved the secret garden enjoyed the animals tigers and dolphins. The indoor mall is expensive and overpriced but the restaurants are good. The pool was awesome we really enjoyed it. Overall the hotel is outdated and in need of an upgrade old carpets and fixtures.
50,We have stayed several times at the Mirage. It’s reasonably priced….Never been disappointed……this was just a quick weekend get away to see two great Vegas concerts staff friendly helpful room was very quiet and clean.
30,Great place to visit the Dolpins and Beautiful Secret Garden. Stay was nice. Kid friendly. Make sure you revere a spot near the pool. No one told us that and it gets really busy. Paradise Cafe was nice.
40,A great hotel and a great location right on the main strip and what I would say is the nicer end of town. Near everything like other hotels and food etc. room was clean and spacious. Staff friendly and helpful. The casino itself was incredible. The only thing I would say is they charge for everything which my partner and I were not used to. We asked for a fridge $35 a day opened the fridge and looked at a beer can charged $55 (albeit they did remove this when we checked out) prepare to have credit card on hand $14 for a small glass of wine!
50,Very friendly staff. Great location that is in the heart of the strip. We were able to walk to all the shows we had booked. On site food options were above par for quality- reasonable option if you don’t want to eat on the strip
10,No Smart TVs. No streaming options.  Entire pool area is designated Smoking. There is no non-smoking area by the pool. Seems like a gigantic miss. Room was musty and warm. AC didn’t cool the room. Just feels old and outdated.
50,My wife and I had a great time last week at the Mirage. From check in which was a breeze thru the app. The friendly people working there. The super nice pool area. The Love Beatles show which is always a favorite. The Costa Italian Restaurant. We just had a really good time. I'd say it's a medium sized property and kinda cozy compared to some of the others we have been to. I'd recommend it to anyone. That and it being quite central on the strip is a positive too.
20,Location is great. but ... not much else; cigarettes on the carpet in the hotel room hallways no microwave or coffeemaker no room service old decor no bottled water or other water when you get to your room
40,We typically pick the Mirage due to location and during pool season because of it’s beautiful outdoor space. The rooms however are average and have small bathrooms. They dont have mini frig’s but still have mini bars and snacks for sale in room which is so outdated and with the various Walgreens and CVS stores in walkable distance can’t imagine anyone’s bothering to use. Thankfully the staff is nice
50,Mirage is simply the best! Hands down. Property was clean  rooms were clean the staff treated me and my family as good as expected . We will definately be returning in the near future . We are already planning
40,The resort property was wonderful and even the smoking part of the casino was not overwhelming- they do a great job at keeping air circulating! The check-in process was simple and the room was clean. As others have mentioned the bathroom is a bit small and the door comes centimeters from the toilet but it was clean with good water pressure so no complaints. The room itself was ample and clean and the bed was very comfortable.    Most employees were friendly respectful and knowledgeable. We were there 5 days/4 nights and did not want maid service during our stay but we received towels when requested. The shops had everything you may need or may have forgotten at home and there is a Walgreen's across the street. We enjoyed the Secret Garden are and were especially grateful to the ladies working at The Roasted Bean on property. I have no idea how they do it but they are swamped with customers yet super quick and pleasant at every interaction!    We used the pool a few hours one day and it was very nice. We could not find a lounge chair at 10 am but still made the best of the morning!    At checkout I asked to have the resort fees reduced (not waived just reduced) since we did not have very good Wi-Fi service (we have T-Mobile) in the building did not use the maid service and used the pool one day without lounge chairs as they were all full. The staff member guffawed and rolled his eyes as he went on a long rant about what the resort fees covered and that it is only waived for Gold member status. I have pearl and I reiterated that I was asking for it to be reduced due to reasons previously stated at which point he rambled on about how most people do not like paying this fee but there is nothing he can do and it has nothing to do with cleaning services. I work with the public and I understand that you have to tell people no however telling someone no in a respectful manner is a must. I would have accepted that but the disrespectful manner in which I was declined a reduced resort fee makes me think twice about coming back. Luckily this was the only rude employee we came across- too bad it was the last employee I interacted with.
30,I've always wanted to stay here based on the exterior look. The inside was disappointing it wasn't bad but feels like it needs some updating. Don't bother with volcano views from the room the best view is from the strip.
50,Another great stay at the Mirage. If you are interested in friendly and professional staff across the board at a property that is not too big but has it all… then the Mirage is the place to be. I will be sorry to see it change hands.
30,Upon check in I was told I had a $50 resort credit toward food and beverage which I never received. It was super crowded and felt off. Some not all of pool staff was rude and i would suggest not using mobile order bc it will take at least an hour to get your order. Hotel is extremely cold insides even if 95 degrees outside you will see many people wearing sweaters. I stayed one night at Harrahs which was by far cheaper pool hours were 9-10 pm except pool closed on Monday and Tuesday. At Mirage pool closes promptly at 6 pm and they start shutting down at 5 pm. 👎🏼
50,Heather was great at the pool. Took great care of us. Staff is friendly and rooms are clean. Food is expensive but good. Bell staff are great and front desk staff are fantastic. We would have stayed longer if we could.
20,"Room Smelled horrible like Musty Cigarettes. Was promised an ""Air Purifier"" by staff multiple times. No one ever came. After the 4th time complaining they said they don't have Air Purifiers. Grabbed a house keeper in the hallway and they sprayed airfreshner and said to leave the window open. Didn't help and ruined my luggage. Couldn't watch tv because remote didn't work and was leaking battery acid. Only plus check in staff was friendly. Checked out 2 days early and went to another hotel across the street. Will not be coming again."
50,We had good food great Beatle Love show & Volcano was a bonus. Machines were fun & paid well! Staff in the small Essential store were extremely friendly & are the only ones who asked for MGM card for discounts
50,Darius was awesome at check in! Upgraded us to a fantastic stay!!! Very customer friendly. I felt he was working on a perfect stay for us!!! Gabby at Rhumbar Lounge is the best. She makes our stay like we’re at home away from home. She’s family to me and our group!!!
20,The front desk staff is not nice at all. No welcome to the customer. The hotel room is dirty we found some hair on the hanger which is left over from the other customers. The desk cover with dust.I wouldn’t go back to this hotel anymore.
50,We love the Mirage and have stayed there multiple times over many years. We love the pool especially! Costas is by far the best Italian. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. We will deeply miss the volcano once it is gone - very sad to see it change.
50,Been staying here for 33 years. Pool and cabanas are the best. Love the palms. Just overall a great vacation. Food and service was excellent! Whenever a problem it was addressed and fixed. (Although. It really problems)
50,If you really want to be treated like royalty the Mirage this the place to stay. The staff is excellent and the food is amazing! Also every woman must see Menopause the Musial at Harrah’s Cassio. Amazing
40,"Stayed on ""stay well floor floor 12"". Decent rooms could use update electronics and bathrooms. Fitness room has cyber Eagle equipment..very good. Wish fitness facility was open past 5.  Only negative is I think room had bedbugs..had bites all over arms....was in 1238."
50,The Mirage continues to be the best hotel on the Vegas Strip. Plus it has Beatles “  Love” which remains a great show. The rooms are great. The food is excellent. The service from the staff is friendly. Location wise the hotel is the perfect place to be on the Vegas Strip.
10,We were celebrating my husbands birthday. Check-in room was not ready. Gave us another room with no view and the chair was dirty as if someone had been having sec on it. Ask to be moved and was told we couldn’t be moved because we had committed to this room but would move us the next day. Never got moved and the chair never cleaned or switched out. Will not stay again
20,There are way better quality rooms for a lot cheaper than The Mirage. The rooms were dirty bugs in the bathroom and there were no refrigerator coffee maker or microwave in the rooms. I asked for a shower chair for my roommate multiple times even prior to our stay and never received one.
50,The Mirage is very easy to like. Traditional and not complicated. Amanuel is our host and he makes everything so easy. Food and the sports book were also easy. Very little to dislike and the location is great
50,Great resort to take kids to. Central location on the strip. If you’re driving there. This property has the closest parking garages to the hotel. So it’s good if you have kids with you. Will definitely consider next time I’m coming to LV
40,Over all good stay. The staff were all great. The only problem i had was the person who did not want to be at work at the Bell/Taxi station and was very negative about being doing the job. My cleaning staff was awesome one especially. I found the cost of food was high. It would be nice to see the Buffett open again. The volcanic mountain was amazing as always.
40,Great stay as usual enjoyed the pool and restaurants. Staff was very friendly and always greeted you with hello/good morning and always asked there was anything we needed. Pool beverage service was very good
30,Better Fitness Center Hours. The fitness center needs to be open for people who work out every day. The hours is not until 6 AM in the morning and closes really early. Most people who travel from the East Coast are up before 6 AM. It is $839 resort fee but why cannot access the fitness center but with limited hours.
50,Place is really fun for what you pay for. Rooms are large but need to be updated. Robata bar is really good food. Sportsbook is old school but lots of fun. Everyone who you encounter is cool and wants to have fun. Only negative is the older men bartenders at the center bar.
40,Overall good experience. Right on the strip. The only take away is it doesn’t have many options for shows. They are out dated. Pool bar breakfast and dining options for were good and recommended. Will be back.
40,We had an excellent stay. Everything was good as expected. We enjoyed the view of the volcano spouting off and the packed boulevard. It was fun people watching from the room. I will be taking my binoculars next time.
40,I was looking forward to our trip and when we arrived to the hotel the lady at the front desk was supper friendly and very polite since it was such an early morning so that made our day. The stay was pleasant as expected except upon check out at the taxi line the gentleman was not so nice.
50,Checking is was quick and simple. Customer service was excellent. Staff were very helpful and accommodating. The room was clean. This hotel is located perfectly in the middle of the strip where all the excitement is at. It’s convenient for walking to restaurants bars and shops.  My stay was very pleasant.
50,We stayed two nights at The Mirage. The room was clean well decorated and comfortable. Our family enjoyed the dolphin and tiger park located within the property. Excellent variety of restaurants on property. We rarely left the resort
50,As with many I am very sorry to see this place change and become a Hard Rock. Love this place and always my go to when in Las Vegas. By far best pool and location on the strip. Going to miss the Mirage.
50,The Mirage offers fabulous restaurants with great food! The hotel staff and service is fantastic Plus the Location is convenient to shopping and visiting other casinos. I wouldn’t stay anywhere else!
40,Mirage was pretty nice. Perfect location. The room was clean but the carpet could stand a nice hot shampooing.otherwise a nice room pretty clean. We enjoyed our stay. We would stay here again. Staff was nice and check-in was smooth.
50,The location is perfect and I love the tropical feel! We ate at four of the restaurants and they were all delicious. Really liked the atmosphere at Osteria Costa. The Center Bar was perfect and there was a DJ 2 of the nights we stayed it was good time!
10,This hotel has been sold and it's clear that the ownership is not fixing anything. There was no coffee pot in the room and you could not use the refrigerator. The door for our room would not easily shut. Overall this is not the place to stay for business travel.
10,Everything was good except my room was not cleaned one night and it ruined the experience for me I called 3 times and it still wasn’t cleaned. Everything else I was happy with and would probably stay again but cleanliness is high on my list
50,Our stay was just as expected. From start to finish all the staff had smiles on their faces and made us all feel welcome. I know that hospitality is short staffed but the only item i felt could improve was having more cocktail waitresses in the casino. Overall a superb stay!
50,Wife and I had a great time at this beautiful resort. Room was clean and updated resort was constantly being cleaned and disinfected. Pool are was clean and updated which we enjoyed very much. Overall we had a great couples getaway.
40,Really great stay at usual. Perfect weather perfect day at pool. Nice room clean and even it was looking pretty occupied days pretty quiet in our room and had perfect night!  Just need maybe st some point try to do something with the bathrooms  Small a little bit and shower maybe need to be remodeled sooner than later  But still really good stay overall
30,Location was great. Employees were helpful. Rooms could of been a little cleaner. not many restaurant options or shops compared to other hotels on strip. need more variety of slot machines. The show in front of hotel was great.
30,The room seemed quite dated and I was not impressed with the casino as it seemed quite dark and air quality was not as good as other nearby hotel casinos. We did enjoy the pool experience for 1 day while there and the food at the two restaurants we ate at was very good.
50,To have stayed at The Mirage has been on my bucket list for hrs and finally came true. What a way to mark off something I’ve always wanted to do where I wanted and to receive the type of service I got. I was so happy that I tried to find ways to stay even longer but unfortunately it was not doable.
30,For the price of $400+ a night this hotel is dated and can use some upgrades. I realize that they will be overtaken by Hardrock but the price should reflect the property. The bathroom was small and the tub was rusting and moldy. There was a fishy smell in the room and we had to open the room to try to air out the smell. Make sure to reserve restaurants (even for breakfast) as everything was packed and only a few options in the hotel. Many of the restaurants in the Mirage do not open until dinner.
50,Gorgeous lobby with orchid gardens/planters and courtyard displays nicer large casino area and comfortable rooms. The volcano erupting at night was very cool to watch. Nicer luxury pool relaxation area. The hotel shops were very convenient and nice. Many amenities at Mirage. I would recommend this property because of cleanliness of room and central location on strip. Easy to walk to and visit other properties as well. Great for people who like to walk and explore due to the great location.
40,This will most likely be my last stay before Mirage changes to the Hard Rock. It is showing it's age but the layout is great. The pool is relaxing yet difficult to find chairs. I was traveling with someone who has some health problems and they had an issue with the room but the staff went above and beyond to accommodate her. I was very impressed by the staff including the Rewards desk and cleaning crew. The air in the casino is well circulated so you don't smell too much smoke. That wasn't the case in some other hotels. I'll be sorry to see it go but it does need remodeling. Overall I enjoyed my stay and will forever have fond memories.
40,The mirage is in a great location. It has some great restaurants and convenient shopping. This is our second time staying in this location and will definitely be back. I wish the standards rooms would get an update tho. The bathrooms leave much to be desired and the rooms could defiantly be cleaner. All in all it is a great stay and we absolutly love the pool here!!!
50,every year we go for the 1st week of pro football from the restaurants down to houskeeping Casino hosts evryone was fabulous. whatever we needed whenever we needed it there was always someone there to satisfy our needs
50,Will definitely stay at this hotel again location was great and I was upgraded rooms after having an issue with the first room I booked when you have an issue and the company takes care of it they way they did for me it only makes you want to stay there again because they show they care about your experience.
50,Check in and out was so easy using the app. Everything was great and would stay there again. Restaurants in the hotel was good as well. Overall stay was good. The pool was very relaxing as well. Great drinks by the pool tooZ
40,Had a great time at the Mirage. Staff super friendly especially pool staff and room was amazing and had everything we could have needed. Location is perfect and many food and drink options. Table minimum is too high.
10,Staff is beautiful but the property is ugly for large size wheelchair guest. The doors to the room are 33 inches wide carpet on the floor tables too low for the power wheelchair to roll up to the beds have a platform and you cannot use a Hoyer lift because of the platforms they put the beds on. Let's just say they do the minimum requirements by the ADA. Call and check before you go and ask a lot of questions.
10,motel 6 has better appliances and build quality. mirage just uses higher quality stone and fabrics. everything is built to make you need to buy $7-9 bottles of water and $10 snacks and meals at $10-20 mark up each. staff is mostly indifferent and expect to pay literally 5x the online price if you extend stay at front desk.
50,Had a wonderful time with friends eating drinking pooling gambling. Got a great deal and so enjoyed the $50 credit for lunch at the pool. Heard it's been bought by Hard Rock. Will miss the Mirage.
30,I was at the Mirage for 2 nights/3 days for my birthday after staying at another less expensive hotel two days before. Compared to the other hotel my stay at the Mirage was lacking. Poor customer rep- front desk didn’t answer phone on multiple occasion and when they finally did the rep said she was working by herself and next time i should come to front desk (what if I had an emergency?!). The room was smaller than expected and bathroom definitely tight (and I’m skinny). The room view was overlooking a roof top showing some rusty industrial or HVAC looking items. I tried to get the room switched even to pay more but was told more guests were expected so I had to wait until next day. I was offered some comp but never used it because I was leaving the next day. I was disappointed because I don’t think I got what i paid for! Almost ruined my birthday!
10,I have stayed in multiple hotels I have to say this place is awful. The rooms have an odor of a moldy basement and the air conditioning doesn’t work! The manager on duty is awfully rude so if you stay here you have been warned! RUN!
50,We love Crystal at the front desk. She brought that old Vegas vibe back for us! Fun funny considerate honest friendly helpful and so down to earth. She made our stay. As the first person most people speak to when entering a hotel which is the front desk check-in. That’s where the fun began and the mood was set for us! We left the front desk feeling excited and important! Great job!
40,I visited the Mirage on 9/2/22 for 4 days and was welcomed from the minute I walked into the door by bellhop and the front desk. Check- in went smoothly like 5 mins later I was headed to my room with room key. No problems with room it was cleaned very well my complete itinerary was correct. Even though while playing blackjack I lost a lot of money I enjoyed playing at the dealer Margarita table she is a very good dealer who was very friendly to everyone who played at her table. so I wanted the thank Margarita for her kindness and hospitality.
50,We are enjoyed how clean and well-maintained the resort was. Staff were friendly. The gym was nice and provided all the equipment we use at home. The casino tricked my husband in to spending all his money 🤣
50,We love this resort! The size is not overwhelming so everything is handy. The location is central and close to everything we like. Pool is terrific too - we did reserve seating one day and I highly recommend that. Chaise lounges we’re super comfortable and umbrellas were appreciated when you wanted to take a break from the sun.
10,Literally probably one of the worst places on the strip to stay. I stayed 2 nights 3 days and I couldn’t even get house keeping to come clean. I called multiple times through the day. Got confirmation each time and they never followed through. Also the hotel was a bit shady with my free play and food/beverage credit that the reservations agent confirmed for me.
40,Hotel room was large and clean. The staff are friendly and enjoyed our visit. The pool area has lots of seating. Wish they had a non smoking area doesn’t need to be big but with allergies it would be nice.  Too bad it is changing to Hard Rock.
50,Hotel staff was courteous room was nice and always kept up. Surrounding area had good choices for food able to travel to different area quite easily. Easy Check In just read the fine print for mobile check in.
50,Everything we experienced during our stay was great. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The pool was nice. The casino was clean and staff was prompt. The location is right in the middle of the strip making it ideal.
20,My family and I visited Las Vegas on 9/9 and 9/10 and we stayed at the Mirage. We had a great time on our trip but we were disappointed in the room. It seemed old and worn had a “smell” to it. The location is good but we won’t stay there again.
40,Bathroom was too small and the hand rail had rust on it in the tub/shower combo. The room however was immaculately clean. The staff seemed friendly and there’s several really good food options/restaurants
30,I would recommend the mirage based on the pool area and location on the strip based on the value. That said I don’t know what to expect once hard rock takes over but if it is anything like when hard rock was in Las Vegas in the past I would consider other locations
50,The Mirage was in a great location! The beds were comfortable and rooms were spotless! Plenty of places to eat within the hotel. Of the four places we ate in the hotel we have not one complaint. The food was delicious!
50,The rooms are very roomy and clean. The hotel is reasonably priced especially if your a mgm rewards member. The restaurant staff are awesome. It’s always service with a smile. Pool is very nice and big. Loved our stay
50,The Mirage rooms and casino are very clean. Security does an amazing job of keeping the grounds safe. The pool was beautiful! All staff members we’re very kind and helpful. My wife and I are excited to comeback and enjoy everything The Mirage has to offer.
40,Would have given a higher rating except for The room was not cleaned our last day  leaving us coming back to a dirty room. With no clean towels and no shampoo. Called housekeeping and they delivered towels 40 minutes after calling
40,Overall the trip was really nice besides a couple of small issues that were taken care of (check in and the dog in the room next to us barking constantly)    We will go back and i will recommend people to stay there
50,Very very nice employees great location and great atmosphere! I love all the attractions there and all the great restaurants and the cleanliness! I just started stay there last year and will not stay anywhere else!
50,Our trip was for my boyfriends birthday. Our stay was amazing from start to finish. Service was great check-in and out was simple and easy the pool is great. The restaurant’s were also fantastic. :)
50,Just a great experience from check in to checkout. Sad to see Mirage go. Absolutely loved the pool and servers. Very nice! All around we had a wonderful experience and would love to come back in near future.
50,Everyone from front desk to drink servers restaurant employees etc. made me feel like a valued guest. Front desk employee Andrew kindly looked to see if we could upgrade our room and even though there wasn’t an option he still took great care of me.
40,The front desk guy Renzo was a jerk at check-in which sucked because we were all so happy to be there after a 9 hour car ride. The pool was the property's saving grace. My kids (and I) loved the pool. I wish it stayed open later than 6 pm.
50,Customer Service made you feel right at home and very friendly and answered any questions they needed answers to either one that asked about. We love the location to restaurants bars and entertainment and casinos thank you.
40,My first time at the Mirage hotel and wanted to stay closer to the center strip. Overall it’s still quite a walk to most things so I recommend taking an Uber if you’re wanting to explore further down the strip. Room check in was easy and room requests were honored we had two connecting rooms overlooking the Volcano. Great views of the strip on the 25th floor with private elevators that go straight there. Parking garage was easily found and not too far to walk. $18 overnight self parking -It’s in the same location as the Uber/taxi area. The Mirage volcano never went off at the 8pm time during our stay. And several nights it didn’t go off at 9pm or 10pm either. They definitely are phasing it out I’m sure. We did see it a few times from our room but on the street we went down once and it was a waste of time as it never went off. Mirage has a beautiful pool with waterfalls it’s huge! And the pool is COLD so refreshing for Vegas being 115* while we were there. The people started lining up at 7am to get a chair at the pool which doesn’t open until 9am. Crazy how hostile it got just trying to get in when it opens. Around 1pm or so a lot of people leave the pool so I would recommend skipping the line police at 9am. Room was quiet and comfortable but the wear and tear on furniture curtains bathtubs was obvious. It’s time for a remodel so hopefully with hard rock coming in it will get some proper updates. The Beatles show was on a two week break when we went super disappointed didn’t get to see the show. I would 100% stay here again the value was great. Room fridge/mini bar is quite the rip off…and no coffee maker so I bought one on Amazon to skip the Starbucks $$$. Also there’s a convenience type store located in different areas of the hotel I think called Essentails…in the hotel it’s 2 beers for $18 and a free shot. At the pool they have this same store and it’s $18 for ONE beer so walk around the corner back inside the hotel and get the same beers to bring to the pool yourself. Beers are 25 ounces and they’re super cold in the cooler. There’s my best tip I found when staying here. There’s also a taco/Mexican restaurant across from Starbucks with $5 tacos that are great to grab on your way back to your room they make them fresh when you order. A great deal!
40,I have stayed at the mirage several times in the past. It is getting dated and the rooms definitely need some Reno’s. The hotel is close to several stores shops McDonald’s and other food spots so that is a bonus. The resort fee is a rip off as the wifi barely worked the whole time we were there and our TV would not turn on for the 5 days we were there. Trying ti get someone up to fix it was painful and time consuming. We don’t usually use the tv but the weather was above 40 Celsius everyday so we had to take breaks in the room. Not sure what the resort fee even covers anymore but we didn’t see any benefits or it. Pool is nice. Hard to get chairs most days. I probably would not go back unless updates are done to rooms as there are several other nicer places to stay on the strip for the same price or less.
40,It was a fun business trip. Lots of nice restaurants. Easy access to the convention center in the hotel. Lines for coffee were long in the am and the pool was too crowded. Favorite restaurant was the Pantry!
50,A÷ services. From house keeping to the casino floor.. nothing but 1st class.. Will definitely be back appreciate the services you provide for our interests I would highly recommend staying here can't wait to return!
30,I travelled to the Mirage for an business convention that was held onsite at the casino. I have no complaints about the room or the service everything was extremely clean the room was very quiet checkout was easy and quick and every employee at the hotel and casino was professional and friendly. However the casino was a terrible venue for the convention as loud 80's music blared from every corner of the restaurants hallways even the elevators making conversation difficult if not impossible when trying to meet with clients. There were no quiet spaces in fact the crowded line for the pool extended right to the trade show area for our convention. Additionally the restaurants had no posted schedules just large QR codes on signs that led to general internet sites and even the employees didn't know if and when they'd be open. A few were never open the entire week we were there which was disappointing. The casino itself is a confusing maze of twists and turns it took at day or two just to remember how to get around and nothing was convenient just lots and lots of walking. Additionally the restaurants had one food portion jumbo meaning there were no light meals just a huge expensive plate every time. Great for a casino vacation I suppose but not so much for professional business lunches. As a hotel the place was everything I'd expected clean and quiet and the value for the room was great. The staff was very helpful at all times. As a business convention destination it was noisy smoky and just unpleasant and I was happy to leave.
20,"I have stayed at the Mirage at least 25 times and over the years they continue to underwhelm. Nothing inspiring about this place. In fact it is a constant grind to remove as much as possible from your wallet. Example: my wife schedules a massage and they add on a compulsory ""resort gratuity"" of 20%. Presumptuous would you agree? Be aware...it is just the beginning of your stay. Good-bye Mirage. I will not miss you."
50,We come here every time we come to town. We love the location and the hotel stay is always great. It is right in the middle of the strip and close to all the other great casino’s. Great shopping and food.
50,The rooms are very nice and housekeeping accommodated us by cleaning the rooms on our schedule. I love the food at the steakhouse and the mexican restaurant the most but all of them are really good. My host Brandy was simply the best.
50,We have stayed at The Mirage for years now and still love it! The location cannot be beat the Oasis pool is awesome all the restaurants are great and the staff is very friendly and helpful. We stay in the Hospitality Suite and it worth the extra money. Rooms are clean and beds are very comfortable too. Will stay here again next year.
30,The hotel is beautiful but simple things like getting housekeeping to clean your room before 4pm seems impossible in this hotel. Pool opened an hour and fifteen minutes late while over 100 people stood on line waiting. Not a single restaurant could accommodate a party of two for breakfast without having to wait over an hour every single day of our stay. For such a big hotel these things should not happen.
10,AC did not work in my room and when I called I was told it was motion activated! My AC did not work properly my last two days of the conference I attended. Customer service was non-existent and I will not stay at the Mirage again
50,The mirage is a great hotel to stay. So sad is going to close next year. But I'm going to try to stay here one more time before they close. Great staff overall and also great location right in the middle of the strip from my opinion
30,The room floors were not cleaned. The shower drain backed up and gurgled all nightyou have to close bathroom door or be awake all night. Difficult to get drinks while playing seems lack of staff. Can’t play real long worse casino for luck had to always go somewhere else to have fun.Glad to hear they may tear it down to replace with hard rock.
40,Room could be better to the guests. Fridge and items are mandatory to buy even if u touch them. If u have any children be careful to they don’t touch anything if will not buy. Small and poor restroom. Should have a buffet at hotel.
40,The Mirage is a solid hotel. It's kept clean nice looking and has a beautiful atrium in the middle of the hotel. It has some noticeable wear and tear in the rooms but is still a nice place to stay that is not too deep into the heart of the Strip and all of its traffic.
50,"We have been coming to the Mirage for the last 4 years and LOVE it!. Hotel is beautiful rooms are very clean Tons of restaurants on site Great variety of games to play and WIN! SO CLOSE to everything. We love this location. Everything we like to go to is within walking distance. Short Uber to some additional shows on opposite side of strip. Also Highly recommend the restaurant down the street - El Segundo Sol go say hello to ""D"""
50,Love this hotel. We had a great experience and will definitely come back. Everything was great. Staff was great. Customer service at its best. We came for a wedding and the view of the Skyview suite was amazing.
50,We just returned from an amazing stay at the Mirage. Best pool in the history of pools. Super friendly staff. Highly recommend staying there. You can’t go wrong. Absolutely beautiful from the entrance to the rooms to the casino to the restaurants and of course the pool!
20,Once a jewel of the strip the Mirage is just a shell of it's former self. It's apparent the purchase by Seminole Hard Rock has taken it's toll. Everything is expensive there are NO comps and the resort itself is obviously not getting the upkeep it was when it's ownership was stable. Too bad. I wanted to experience the Mirage before it was gone completely. Unfortunately that time had already come.
50,This hotel was great. It was a last minute trip booked via price line and I was 100% satisfied. The room was great very roomy and comfortable. The location of the hotel was awesome very convenient and easy to get to the Strip. Hoping my next trip will be here again.
30,Old casino and it shows in many ways. The rooms are adequate for what you pay and so is the level of service you get while playing or dining. The location is very good on the strip and really the best draw of this casino at this point. Just remember you get what you pay for when it comes to rooms and service in Vegas and The Mirage is a direct reflection of that.
50,We absolutely love the pool location and friendly helpful personnel at the Mirage - we put on many miles this week so we were happy that we were centrally located - every trip I take to Vegas is different depending on who I travel with yet this hotel seems to fit whether family couple or girls getaway - weather you wan5 to relax or be in all the action the Mirage provides everything you need
50,Exactly everything one would hope for from a resort: great rooms exciting casino good bar options fantastic pool area etc. I’ll miss if it changes in the future. Location on the strip is quite central easy to get around on foot to central strip.
50,Couples trip to celebrate a birthday and to see and explore sights and locations always heard about. Came to see Shania Twain at the Planet Hollywood do a little gambling. enjoy nightlife have a little relaxation
50,Had a great time at the Mirage. Stayed at a few different resorts (MGM) and the Mirage was the best! Great location to food and family activities. Had great front desk service and pool experience. Family enjoyed!
30,I found the Mirage to be a nice place with average food and a very expensive cost to me. I had a nice steak in the steak house and found it very average for $120 US dollars.    Unless I have to go back here for a conference again I would not recommend or stay her again.
20,This property use to be good now it has been taken over by dirty quality of casino floor to rooms we have stayed here many of times and actually glad it is shutting down now everything smells like cigarettes and everything was dirty the restrooms from the restaurants to the rooms! Not impressed
40,I wont comeback and not to refer this hotel. Cant figure it out why at 1am in the morning there is alarm in our hotel. It really sucks. Facility is really nice but have old bathroom. For the fact that i am from different states and experience unconvinced sucks this is the only hotel ive been at 1-2am there is faulty alarm.
40,Rooms had a refresh...nothing fancy but enough to make a difference...nice size...clean and spacious bathroom...IMO the best location on The Strip...nice choice of restaurants...fitness center a plus...small non-smoking slot parlor...  Now make the whole casino non-smoking and get rid of that stupid resort fee and parking charge!!!
50,Away time for me. Mirage and MGM in general is great. I would and have recommended MGM to my friends and associates on many occasions. Food great. Buffet at Bellagio very good and huge selection as well. 1¹
50,Thanks for the great stay. Enjoyed it the pool is nice. Will stay again in the future. The mirage has a Starbucks as well. Good food spots to dine. You can see the tigers  also they have dolphins where you can go and see as well.
40,We enjoyed our stay at the Mirage. Great location and casino. Only complaint I have is the room smelled musty and the bathroom is too small. Loved the lobby and aquarium behind the front desk. Did not make it to the dolphins maybe next time.
40,Coffee pot in room would be welcomed - having to go to lobby was hard each morning  Room service wanted 18 for mom 5 cups plus service  Mini fridge water 18 - not allowed to use for meds  Pool amazing  Hotel good - enjoyed my time in vegas  Employees helpful and friendly
50,Is a great hotel. Really to bad the end is near for the Mirage 😔we have stayed here numerous time and were never disappointed. It’s location is great. Close to transit and monorail. I will miss the volcano
20,The bedding was not changed and flaky skin and other specs on the sheets. At 1 a.m. we as the guest had to change our sheets. The cleaning staff also did not vacuum. We had to ask for our brown carpet to be vacuumed from all the white specs on it. We also had to call maintenance for the sink clog in the bathroom...the offset of this is the maintenance man gave us $25 off per person in the room to eat at the resorts restaurant of our choice. No refrigerator and if we wanted one it was a $50 per day charge this should have been a given amenity. There was not a coffee pot/coffee in room...resort looks ok but acts cheap with the guess. All staff were nice and accommodating where they could be.
50,Went with a group of family members including one teen. Relaxing time at pool and enjoyed all the restaurants that were already at the hotel. Did not have to travel far. Friendly staff great accommodations.
20,The Mirage was the first hotel I stayed at 30 years ago when I turned 21. That was about 30 years ago and I came back last week to say goodbye to a fond memory before the Hard Rock takeover. I was surprised the she still had her beauty but like us all we’ve aged just a bit. The room was very rough. The A/C did not work the whole time despite a service call that went unfixed. I asked for new pillows because the existing ones smelled like sweat. I was delivered more sweaty pillows. That made it uncomfortable to try and sleep coupled with the lack of coolness and to top things off both mattresses were very uncomfortable and springy. The room also had a sweaty smell to it and was not fresh. I would expect something like this at the Excalibur or Circus Circus but not the Mirage a once shining gem in the desert but now it’s fading like a mirage would.    I must say the staff though was fantastic. Brandi at the California Pizza Kitchen was amazing and hospitable. The best award goes to James at the front desk. He really was very pleasant and understood my challenges with my room. Please give James a high five for me!  All in all I was hoping for a better and cleaner room. That really didn’t sit well with me but I carried on and continued to remember my fond memories of the Mirage that once was….THE BEST in Vegas!    Aloha Mirage. Thanks for the memories.
20,Have stayed here every year since it opened last couple of years I sense it is in major decline. Too expensive for the lack of quality and upkeep. Disappointing as I had not planned to find a different place ever.
50,"This resort is clean beautiful and fun. I have stayed many times in Vegas and this is my favorite resort. I was very pleasantly surprised at how nice it was especially for the price and how old the place is (and being bought out by Hard Rock...I hope they keep it the same). LOVE is the best Cirque du Soleil show I have seen and I have seen many. I am a paraplegic and the ADA room is the best I have been in at any resort the bed is low (about 22"") but is perfect for me but may not be for all who are disabled. Plus in the middle of the strip. Staff was great can't say enough nice things about this resort. But....will say after staying here for three nights and at Luxor for two the MGM rewards left a lot to be desired. But I don't care any time I come to Vegas I'm staying at the Mirage."
20,I’m losing more than I ever have and my rewards and comp are worse. Vegas doesn’t have anything to offer anymore. You can get similar experience in other places with more amenities. Plenty of bums on the streets now too. Very run down city.
50,Great stay with relaxing aura and tranquil amenities. The only issue for us was the bed being a little too firm for our liking. Other than that an amazing stay! The sanctuary and dolphin show is worth the $25pp. The Pantrys Belgian waffle is to die for!! Must try!
50,Lovely hotel despite the lack of the volacano show!! The pool is amazing!! Rooms are clean! Walgreens is right across the street which was a major plus. The bus stops right in front of the hotel which makes it easy to get to other places and back!
30,The poker room is gone the buffet is closed the Mexican restaurant Diablos was closed both days I was here the volcano didn’t erupt on time and probably never did as I got tired of waiting like the rest of the impatient crowd. They used to pay it forward the Veterans with half off at the buffet and there’s no substitute now that the buffet is closed
50,Staff and casino are top notch and very accommodating. Great experience!! The front desk staff is so nice and the hotel is always clean. We’ve been coming every year since we got married in vegas. Wouldn’t stay anywhere else.
50,The theme of this hotel makes you feel like your on a tropical vacation the staff are super friendly and the volcano attraction is a must see for free and will be going away soon. If you've ever been on the fence of going to the Beetles Love show do yourself a favor and go it will not disappoint!
50,This trip was just an get away and just relaxed. Met up with my brother and his wife we all had a wonderful time. We rented a car and really enjoyed dinning outside the Casino. We visited the surrounding area plus other MGM properties.
50,Excellent staff clean beautiful hotel with such a tropical feel this is also a great location the center of the Vegas strip near everything .    Everyone will experience a great time from the kids to the grandparents
50,I can say nothing but good things about the Mirage and staff. We have been treated quite good and I am more than thrilled at the service we have received. Our host has been more than courteous and has made sure everything was in order.
10,I mean I get we go out a lot but it seemed more like a budget motel with no water pressure and miserable employees. One employee even told me how terrible his day was without me even asking.. not worth the price
50,Great rooms and staff the property is prime location on the strip has a monorail great price on rooms and asked about an upgrade and got the penthouse with strip and volcano view for a steal.. very happy and pleased!
50,Iwas expecting the worst seeing how the Mirage has been sold but the rooms were nice the restaurants were good and the vibe was not of a dead casino but of vibrant place with guests. I hadn't been there in about 25 years and going there now I thought it was much smaller than I remembered but no matter I had a good time (saw the Beatles LOVE show ate at 3 of restaurants shopped and gambled). Someone said construction for the new hotel would start in October but just a rumor I think. I got an upgrade to a suite got free valet parking and they waived the resort fees - that part of it was essentially free so yes it was good trip. I would recommend.
40,Stayed at the Mirage. Very nice place comfortable rooms (although the bathrooms were small). No coffee machines or usable fridge in the room. It did have a stocked one with sensors that we didn’t utilize. It was clean and felt safe; we would definitely stay there again.
50,First time staying at the Mirage and I can say I had a great time. The hotel was clean and the bed was comfortable. Loved the center bar with music at late night. Plenty of parking. Would recommend to friends & family.
50,Mommy daughter trip was great at this girl loved all the plants and cleanliness of this hotel the pool was so pretty and big enough to enjoy even on a holiday weekend I would most definitely stay again
40,Wanted to stay here before the change.  Glad I did it was fun. Close to the strip other hotels are a long walk. The restaurants inside are really good just wish some of them stayed open later. Will stay after the change for sure.
50,Very sad to see this property going away soon. One of the best hotels in Vegas highly recommended to stay if you get a chance before it changes over. The pool screen is top of the line. Not sure if they plan to change that as well but it truly feels like your in an oasis.
50,Check in/out was quick. Rooms were spacious and clean. Concierge was very nice and helped us book 3 shows. The Italian restaurant meal was amazing and the pool area was like an oasis. Overall a great trip we'll be back!
20,Room was just ok and looked nothing like picture we booked the 2 queen bed and on the picture it looked very nice and modern and once we walked in we were greeted with very retro decor and beddingshower was moldy and sealing light was dangling at the entrance not very good.loved the hotel but the room not so much.
20,The hotel is beautiful HOWEVER everything is over priced. There’s no amenities in the room. What’s the point of having a fridge when we can’t use it? If you touch any of the snacks or drinks your room automatically gets charged. If we wanted snacks we could go to any of the overpriced stores in the hotel. My room was no where near the elevator on the 8th floor. That was weird to only have a single elevator. I’d rather stay at a smaller hotel close to the strip than this hotel.
10,I know MGM has sold the hotel and will be off the property in December but they have completely given up. This used to be one of the nice spots to stay on the Strip not any more. the rooms are beat up and all the staff seem to be holding on for the changeover in December. Shame on MGM this is a disgrace.
40,We had arrived at the Mirage on Friday. Labor day weekend. We arrived and Vallet was so rude to us. We were 2 girls who needed help with our luggage and vallet talked to us so rude. Vallet or bell desk. whichever. We complained to the front and all they said was sorry. Our room air didn’t even work anyways. It would not go under 77°. We might not come back .
30,The room smelled like stale smoke and mildew. The smell was unbearable. We had to keep the window open even though it was 110 degrees outside. Management wouldn’t change our room. Housekeeping threw away a paper bag that contained snacks my wife’s $100 sandals and a $200 dress. The bag wasn’t even near the trash can.
50,Wonderful stay. Every staff member we came across went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and quiet. The general atmosphere of the resort was beautiful. We reserved two beds in the private oasis area of the pool and had a relaxing day with excellent service there.
10,We paid for early check in but found our room hadn't been cleaned on arrival. We asked that some please come clean it and when we got back we noticed it had been vacuumed but the bathroom was still dirty (hair in the tub and fruit flies). We ended up buying our own bathroom bleach cleaner from a Walgreens to spray and wipe the tub ourselves so we would feel comfortable using it. The major bummer was no one ever followed up with us.    The prices at the resturants and bars didn't reflect the quality of the food/drinks we had. 30$ for drinks at the overcrowded pool....    Just kinda disappointed in general.
40,The mirage is located centrally to all the action. The hotel itself is very nice and the food was delicious. The only complaint I had was that my shower was not giving me any hot water and I had to take a cool shower but it was so hot outside I didn’t mind it terribly. The room could be a bit cleaner with the carpet but overall a good experience. The pool is fantastic!
10,We decided to stay at the Mirage instead of the Park of Bellagio like we usually do. the customer service at the Mirage was awful and we fully regret our decision to switch things up. the only reason we wanted to stay at the Mirage was bc of how it has been sold and bc they may tear it down next year.
30,The room was spacious and comfortable. Unfortunately it takes a few hours of walking to get from the car to the room or the room to a restaurant or from the room to outside. Otherwise fairly decent. Not worth weekend rates though.
40,I enjoyed a fantastic 3 day getaway to Vegas the last weekend of August 2022. The Mirage was great! Centrally located and easy to get to everything. The only downside was the pool closing at six pm. It should definitely be open later!
50,So very disappointed it is the end of the line for the Mirage! We’ve been coming here for years and just love it! From the staff to the pool to the service it is one of the best for the price. We will certainly miss it!
40,This is prime strip location. Conveniently located to and containing great restaurants. The also have a great pool and who could forget the amazing volcano attraction that pulls in a crowd every time. They will surely be missed once the Hard Rock transition happens.
30,I hear it is going to be remodeled soon. That would be great. The hotel was a little dated. The pool area was old as well.the restaurants should be replaced with more modern brands.  The location is great and the elevator access was quick and easy.
30,On the second night of a 4-night stay the room had a water leak and almost half of the room’s carpet was soaking wet. Not sure but it may have been due to the air conditioner. Also the tram that runs between the Mirage and Treasure Island was off and on out of service.
40,This was the fourth time at the Mirage for my wife and I as we keep coming back as the service food and entertainment is excellent. The staff is very friendly and the food in the restaurants are very good as well. I wish they would put refrigerators and coffee in the rooms as that would top it off.
40,We enjoyed our stay at the Mirage overall. The prices at the property for food and drink are on par with other hotels. The staff were all very friendly and attentive.    Rooms were more spacious than I expected. The beds were comfortable. No coffee maker or fridge in which to store drinks (but this is the same as most other strip hotels). There is a mini bar but if you touch or move anything you get charged automatically.    The main drawback of the room was the bathroom. The ventilation was terrible. You could smell everything hours after the fact. It was pretty gross especially if traveling with friends.
50,I would recommend staying at the Mirage- nice atmosphere nice selection of restaurants friendly staff and great location. We enjoyed the Beatles tribute that made our trip and really was spot on for that era of music. It was just amazing!
10,-We did NOT do late check out (as we checked in the guy said you couldn’t do it anyway) yet I got charged for it.  -The refrigerator took almost two hrs to be delivered to the room (we didn’t even know there was no fridge) and our pastry fillings were melting we were also running late to our show because of the wait. The 4th time we called for the fridge the girl said “I show it was taken care of” — maybe to the wrong room? Because it wasn’t ours.  Yet we got charged.    -The room was quite literally caked with dust the housekeeping manager came around and said they would take care of it while we were gone. They got the gross pink slimy thing off the bathroom wall on and some “light” dusting in some areas. Pull out the mini fridge or check between the wall and the bed the tops of the door frames/lamps/art-you will be disgusted and embarrassed. We were sneezing anytime we spent in the room.  She also offered us “$25 off food/drinks at the mirage or to see the dolphins” I told her we were leaving as our flight today was 5am-could we get a refund for the rooms instead and she still said she will choose for us and left the coupon when we were gone.  -One of the managers we spoke to the first time said resort fees would be taken off- that didn’t happen.  -The toilet in that room is the loudest out of any hotel I’ve stayed at in my 35 years of age 4 countries 4 states countless cities.  It scared me so much I jumped away and hit myself on the counter.  -The tub was draining very slowly we had to wait for the pool of water to drain after each shower.    The worst part so far has been the lack of empathy and desire for issue resolution.  Planet Hollywood is more attentive and immediately offered to change us rooms the first time we had an issue with them we stayed with them twice before and every time we have nothing but good experiences even if there’s an issue it’s taken care of accordingly.    There’s no outlets by the beds all we heard all night were sirens the doors are so thin as well - nothing compared to Planet Hollywood.    We expected so much more from the Mirage I am requesting a refund.
50,Loved every minute of it. First time staying at the mirage and would go back for sure. The sport book is by far the best on the strip. Every dealer or employee gave great service throughout the whole weekend
30,First things first it only costs $29 for taxi from airport to front door.    First impressions for a first time vegas visitor was ok this is grand. Nice big reception area with aquarium feature behind check in desk. Check in relatively smooth pleasant staff.    Then the long haul from check in to the guest elevators at the rear of the hotel. Nearly all vegas hotels seem to out the casino experience before guest accommodation so you have to battle through crowds of gamblers drinkers and smokers.    The room.  Hmmm what can I say about the room. Well firstly it lacks the initial privacy of other hotels like the premier inn whereby you can’t see the bed from the wide open door so if housekeeping knock and your other half is naked on the bed tough cos housekeeping and other guests will get a cheeky hello view.  Bed - two twin beds relatively comfortable but pillow super soft so not much support. Air con as standard default set to constantly on.  Bathroom - awful. So dated and whatever you do don’t attempt to open the door when someone is using the loo cos you’ll bang the door on their legs.  Toiletries and towels - really scrimp on these given the price paid would expect more than 3 tiny towels for 2 adults one toddler. Fab to dry your hair but not so much to cover an adult body. Also go easy on the fabric softener cos the towels barely hold any water. There is only one hook on the back of the door. Other than the shower curtain rail there is no where else to hang them. They also don’t dry that well as no air movement and room always feels damp even with the noisy extractor fan on. You get one tiny bottle of shampoo conditioner body lotion and two bars of soap. These can be replaced each housekeeping but just take your own.    The bedroom overall is really basic for the price. I’ve paid less and got so much more elsewhere in the world even in capital cities.    Housekeeping don’t change bed sheets just make the bed and replace towels left on the floor even with a weeks booking.    Hotel restaurants and eateries - will review separately but honestly just eat elsewhere. Very expensive!    Tip the vending machines on the guest floors are cheaper than the hotel shop. The supermarket at treasure island is also one of the cheapest for soda and snacks. Hop on the free mirage to treasure island tram located next to the main entrance.    Lastly. The hotel will only run as the mirage for another couple of years then it will be refurbished due to hard rock purchasing the property in 2021.
30,Classic vegas....but the hotel is dated and lacks restaurant and entertainment. Rooms do not have good water pressure no coffee maker and dark lighting. Pool was OK. Casino is dark and dingy with barely any servers around.
20,Some of the staff just to seem not to care since the hotel is being bought out by someone else. But some of the staff was very nice and helpful when needed. The bell hop was amazing and friendly but valet didn’t seem the care very much
50,Very good value hotel friendly and professional staff good restaurants comfortable and clean rooms many game to choose from at the casino. Resort pool also very nice with olanty of seating available.
50,The Mirage is an extremely clean hotel. Bathrooms make you feel you're walking into a Spa Salon! We would definitely stay here again so long as staff and management continue to be of the same caliber! :)
50,We took our two daughters down to celebrate the 21st birthday of the younger one. The staff at Mirage helped to make the occasion special. Great rooms and amenities at the Mirage and an awesome pool...
50,Staff was wonderful I defiantly enjoyed mutator and I will return. I have already booked my room to come back for my 43rd birthday in april. Oh guys and the rooms was awesome had a mini bar in it with all my favs. We enjoy the wonderful food from room service everyday we was there and it wasn’t expensive at all. The best part was the location we was smack in the middle of everything. Thank you for the best time ever.
50,I love staying at The Mirage and have stayed here many times. It has never disappointed and I absolutely love it's tropical ambiance! The pool is absolutely beautiful and easily accessible too. I always have so much fun here.
50,From check in to check out there was no problem. There is always something to do in every hotel but the mirage separates itself from others in a good way. There is a lot of food spots and hang out spots all over the casino the other casinos are awesome to but we always have a great time here.
10,Harassment targeting and discrimination from security staff. My husband and I were evicted on our 5th night without an explanation. When we kept asking for an explanation as two why we were being evicted the lead security ordered that we were hand cuffed. They kept us detained for over two hours and even when they set us free they still didn’t explain as to why we were evicted.
30,We recently stayed at this property based on location and price. We were there to celebrate 2 special occasions while in Las Vegas. The property itself was good. The rooms did seem a little dated but everything was in working order and clean which is important. Make sure when you check in to ask Not to be placed near an elevator or mechanical room if you want any sleep. Also make sure if you have a vehicle to find out the parking situation; we were not told about this upon check in.
50,Very helpful and friendly staff. Rooms Exceed my expectations by 1000%. Stayed here years ago. Was very pleased with the entire stay. Just need bedside plugs for charging phones etc. had to use media table area other than that. Excellent trip and rooms all up to date
50,Love the mirage. It was excellent stay with everything you need. My husband and I are here for a wedding. Came early to have our own little trip as it’s first time since our two year old was born. Mirage always my fave.
50,Everything was wonderful I will be coming back overall the front desk was wonderful the staff was wonderful the pool was wonderful I love the view of my room everything was amazing I really appreciate the above effort
50,We have stayed at the Mirage several times over the years - only interrupted by the Covid pandemic. Always a great visit with wonderful friendly and professional staff. They genuinely make you feel welcome and important. We highly recommend making the Mirage your Las Vegas home away from home!
50,I had a good time and enjoyed my stay at the Mirage my room was very nice and the bed was great. I wish I could have stayed a little longer although it was over a hundred degrees outside my room stayed a cool 72
50,Had a perfect weeks stay at the mirage end of august.  Of course iconic in many aspects beautiful exterior and lobby area from the aquarium behind the front desk to the huge atrium all breathtaking.  Check in was swift no long queues and pleasant staff.  Resort fees are about average for Las Vegas and par for the course I guess when visiting a major city.  Our room was on the south wing 3rd floor corridors and elevators very clean as was our room.  Huge bed! Very very comfortable.  No noise disturbance at all and good air con made sleeping easy.  Bathroom was spacious and clean shower pressure good.  Pool area was lovely but beware of drinks prices…very steep!  Shops in the hotel are nice but again pricey very handy though if you need anything they’re well stocked.  Casino was great kept clean not too smoky and service was efficient day and night.  Volcano was amazing!  We also saw the Beatles show mesmerising and a must do if staying in the hotel (20% discount)  Shane that the mirage will soon make way for the hard rock hotel I feel privileged to have stayed here it was a super holiday from start to finish
50,Not as fancy as some nearby properties but extremely nice facility at less than half the cost. Staff were fantastic and responsive from front desk to bell staff. We had one room issue which was quickly and efficiently addressed. Facility is beautiful and well maintained with great lobby area most beautiful outside on strip (possibly aside from Bellagio) room was very well appointed and quiet (!) and you could not beat location on center/north part of strip. Very good mid-priced value. I would stay again for sure.
50,I love it here!!! The staff are so friendly and my hotel experience was perfect. Especially would like to shout out the hotel housekeeping staff for being super friendly after checkout! I am a MyVegas player and my experience was outstanding on the app and MGM Rewards. Thank you!! 5-Stars all round!
10,Room carpet smelled dirty and wet. We asked for another room which wasn’t given and we had to purchase presidenta suite which was expensive for us. I didn’t expect to spend that much on room. Not happy
50,The Mirage is a nice place to stay for a reasonable price. The gentleman that checked us in was friendly and gave us a credit for the resort. The room was very comfortable and nice. We saw Beatles Love during our stay. We loved it!
50,Absolutely beautiful two bedroom suites on the top floor of the mirage overlooking the Las Vegas strip. Nothing else you could ask for. Room was clean and well appointed. Make a casino host Chad was amazing and hooked us up with food and comedy club tickets. Another successful fun trip to Vegas completed. Thank you everyone at the Mirage for your five star service
50,Hotel is in very good condition and front desk staff was very helpful. Pool area is outstanding. Room was nice and clean. The hotel coffee shop was very well run and the staff was vrey friendly. Enjoyed our brief stay
30,I picked this hotel for the location i usually stay at the Park MGM (used to be monte carlo) and have always been happy at MGM Properties. So I wanted to stay in this area of the strip to explore it more. Gawd what a mistake the hotel its self isn't bad but our room 2100 or floor 2 room 100 was DISGUSTING!!! Our beds had stains from oil? Lots of black smudges from feet/shoes I had to rip the bed apart just to sleep. Our shower/tub the water didnt drain there was pieces of soap and some weird black thing? And blood spots on the wall. Also mold on the shower curtain. The cups they give you had a layer of dust across then.  There was mold all over this room honestly dont stat here it's not worth the money you spend.
50,We have made several trips to Las Vegas and mainly stayed at MGM resorts. We really enjoyed the Mirage casino and are going to be sad to see it leave the MGM family. Ate at the Pantry two mornings as it was excellent for breakfast.
50,Right in the middle of the strip with great access to all the major hotels casinos eateries and shopping. Pleasant experience with clean rooms and nice staff. Very accommodating convenient and overall great experience.
50,We had a really nice time. Everyone was kind helpful and friendly. This is my second time staying here and they have not let me down. I wish the pool stayed open later than 6 o’clock however. Otherwise we will be back!
40,Room was nice and spacious. A/C couldn't seem to be in the right temp as it gets either too warm or cold. Ask for a nice view of the strip but got the back of the hotel instead. Disappointed by that. The down side also was that the bathroom fixture was leaking water in the morning. Good thing i was checking out that morning.
50,Smaller mega resort so it's easy to navigate and not overwhelming. The pool and location on strip are the best features of this hotel. Very good value. The tower rooms have a slightly larger bathroom. Casino is dated but clean. Rooms could also use refurbishing as they are getting worn. Great service all around.
40,One last trip to one of our favorite destinations MIrage you will be missed. If you have the opportunity you should take it Great pools great food amazing view of strip. The casino staff always there to make your stay enjoyable
20,Was left waiting to check in for an hour while the systems were down. Which is understandable but no one bothered to tell us what was going on so instead of finding other things to do while the problems were being resolved we just stood there in line
10,TL;DR Stay at the Mirage if you absolutely must but for your own sake don’t gamble there. (But you really should read this it’s quite the story)    Stayed at the Mirage from 8/25-8/29. The room was ok but I had an absolutely horrible experience at the Casino because of the employees (dealers supervisors) that worked there. I have been playing Ultimate Texas Hold ‘Em poker for 5 years. I come to Vegas every year and I have never not once been treated with such disrespect.    I had a straight with $5 on the Trips $25 on the Ante and Blind each and a $100 bet. The dealer qualified and my straight beat whatever he had. I got paid on the Bet and Ante but noticed I didn’t get anything on the Bonus or the Blind. Just as I was about to mention this to the dealer I noticed the cards had been picked up and a new dealer had come to the table. At this point I’ve been at the table for 6 hours and have accumulated at least 65 hours of play time at the Mirage this trip alone. I asked the new dealer to have the supervisor check the payout on my previous hand. I was increeeeedibly polite. The supervisor didn’t let me tell him what was wrong and called the people ‘upstairs’ who watch stuff through the camera. While he’s doing this the new dealer is convincing me that the cameras never miss anything and I couldn’t have possibly been paid out wrong. Ten minutes later the supervisor comes back saying the guys upstairs said nothing was wrong. I began doubting myself but knew that I had only one red chip in my hand where I should have had five if I’d gotten paid correctly. I insisted I was right which upset the supervisor who muttered something and then called his manager. This manager then called upstairs and came back for the second time to tell me that nothing was wrong. I INSISTED I was right and asked him to call again or to show me the video. I told him I had a straight and he said he didn’t know what I had but that the guys upstairs said it was all correct. So I asked him to confirm that I had a straight. He called them for the third time and came back to give me $20 for the bonus which the guys upstairs now realized I actually hadn’t been given. I asked about the blind which pays 1:1 and he said I got paid on that. Again I had to convince him to check with the cameras. Five minutes a fifth call upstairs and many rounds of humiliation and gaslighting later he came back with $25 on the blind for me. Turns out *gasp* I was right. At this point there are multiple people watching a few guys in black suits frustrated with me and me standing there almost in tears despite being right. Now I should mention I am a 5’2’’ tall brown woman. I don’t know if it was sexism racism or that the house always wins even in a disagreement but the way the dealer floor supervisor and manager spoke to me were unacceptable. Making it seem like they were doing me a favor by making these calls upstairs was unacceptable condescending down to me for merely asking to check was unacceptable and ultimately not respecting me enough to actually check the hand was unacceptable. With so many rules (cards always on the table one hand only no looking at cards once you bet etc.) all so that the cameras and guys ‘upstairs’ can ensure everything is right the ‘guys upstairs’ didn’t even try to do their job.    What frustrates me about this experience the most is that I was starting to feel powerless because I was being treated like an idiot. $45 isn’t a lot of money to go through what I did. But I wanted to stand behind the principle. I counted what I was getting paid but people inherently trust the dealer and by extension the casino to pay them correctly. I wonder how many people have been paid out incorrectly and I wonder how many have been treated as poorly as I was. Everyone makes mistakes and I was totally fine with the dealer who made didn’t pay me. He missed something it’s ok. But everything thereafter was uncalled for.
40,I have stayed at this hotel three years in a row. I love the location and I usually get good deals to stay here. The hotel is beautiful. I can't imagine this hotel no longer being here. Not sure where I will stay from now on.
30,We stayed the first night and the AC did not work the whole night. Once we contacted the front desk they informed us that the latch needed to be latch for the AC to work. So the second night we confirm the latch was latched and there was still AC issues. Other than that location is great and the Casio was good. Just make sure you have working AC.
30,If your looking for good value and a basic room without luxury fit and finishes the Mirage is a nice place to stay. The great staff make up for any shortcomings of the facility. Smokers are welcome at the Mirage so if cigar and cigarette smoke bother you book elsewhere.
50,The hotel is beautiful  the amenities were satisfying. Thee food from Snacks The Pantry and Heritage Steakhouse was great. The location of the Mirage is in of the hotel is perfect if you are driving.
50,Enjoyed my time at the Mirage hadn’t been since the pandemic to Vegas and went right back to the Mirage.    Casino - new rewards system is awesome and the tracking is on point.    Stay - definitely a bargain
50,The resort was very clean had friendly staff and the food was great. The location was perfect A we were able to visit surrounding resorts via walking. The bed was super comfortable. We highly recommend this resort.
40,Loves this hotel due to the location of it on the strip. Standard rooms could use a little upgrade with carpet and furniture. Had AC on the entire time but room still seemed rather warm. Did not need to use sheets or blanket. Casino needs to get rid of 000 roulette 6/5 BJ and needs to bring back coins when you cash tickets in.
40,We had a great time with our family. |The location is great as we are in the middle of the strip and walking ditance of the most Iconic hotels. What I did notice is that not all restaurants in Mirage are open every day. Some close fo a few days in the week. The rest of our stay was perfect. I liked the pool as well.
30,The Mirage is an older property. I remember when it was new and exciting. Our room was spacious and clean. The bed was comfortable. We opted for no housekeeping service. Our main complaint was the noise from the adjacent connecting room and the hallway.
50,We stayed two nights at the Mirage with two teenage boys . We had booked two rooms and got upgraded to a suite  it was amazing and greatly appreciated! The rooms are a little dated but still in perfect condition. The location is perfect pretty much in the middle of the strip with lots of things in walking distance . We visited the pool but it was super busy and we couldn’t get a bed . We say ok the side and cooled off but we didn’t have time to stay long anyway. We didn’t eat in the hotel so can’t comment on that but the volcano show was very good .
40,Iconic hotel with an amazing pool area and some really fantastic Italian food. Friendly staff updated gaming area rooms are adequate beds are comfortable but our room was HOT! Coffee bar needs (a lot of) improvement
40,The rooms are decent Aged but not run down. House keeping could use some improvement but not the worst. The location is extremely convenient. Overall a pretty good value and experience. I would definitely recommend staying here and checking it out before it is gone.
40,This property is one of the oldest on the strip as far as mega resorts go. Front desk staff were helpful and friendly. Room was clean and comfortable. Pool staff were rude and a pain. The pool area is definitely showing its age. Needs updated. Overall was an enjoyable stay and I would stay there again.
40,Staff is awesome here. They make up for the out of date rooms. Room is not to bad but not the best in Vegas. But the. Staff was way better then premium hotels on the strip. If you book here use all the services you can you won’t be disappointed.
40,This hotels amenities restaurants and overall service was great. Great location. Our rooms curtains were dirty as well as chairs in the room. Nothing that stopped our good time. I would definitely stay here again.
40,Stayed with my young son and has a fantastic experience. Can’t wait to do it again. The mirage is our favorite! The pool secret garden and atmosphere inside the hotel were great. Fantastic staff at the restaurants with great recommendations.
30,People should not be allowed to bring pets other than service animals. You show a lack of consideration for those who have allergies. The pool is still the main draw with this property; however the overall hotel upkeep has been poor.
20,The Mirage is a great place to eat gamble and go to the pool. But do not book a hotel room here! The rooms are not properly cleaned and probably not even sanitized. Ripped curtains stained shower curtains and stained towels.
50,Been going to mirage for years and am very sad to see that it has been sold… guess I’ll need to find a new favorite hotel on the strip. Service and value has always been a big win at the mirage not to mention they have one of my favorite pool areas (get a cabana it’s worth it). Thank you for the good times
50,We love the Mirage. Best rooms for larger families on the strip. Perfect size hotel and casino and the best location in Vegas. We have stayed here 5 times now and will continue to in the future. Also Love is the best Cirque show in Vegas!
10,This place has been bought by the Hard Rock and they don't care anymore. I'm a single mum and brought my son to blow his little mind. The first room they gave me didn't have a working safe shower or phone. I told them that was unacceptable so they put us in a room beside the ice machine and under ALL of the elevators. I'm pretty sure this room is generally given out as I was there for 4 days before a cleaning lady even decided to check the room to clean it. It had a view of the parking lot and was extremely outdated. It was like a 2.5-star motel in Canada. Not what I was expecting in Vegas. I had water issues for at least 3 days. The shower didn't drain or was full of black stuff when I came in from a show. When I complained they gave me $100 credit...which is like 1 meal at the resort. It was insulting. Their treatment for what I paid was disgusting and their compensation of $100 when I was there for 6 days was an insult. They don't serve drinks at the Casino like the other hotels since the waitresses are nonexistent...and yes I tip. If you aren't going back...why would they care? They have already been bought out. I think people are nostalgic about this place because I looked at many reviews before choosing and no one is telling people the truth. They are trying to suck you dry before they are out and don't care if you don't want to go back.
50,Great Stay at The Mirage! Sad to see if leave MGM. Everything was great staff was friendly rooms were clean food options good. Very happy to choose Mirage during my last trip to Las Vegas. Again sad to see this leave the MGM program.
50,Great location within short walking distance to a large variety of shopping dining and entertainment. Free parking with there Rewards Program. Also get comped rooms and food vouchers after minimal gambling.
30,About my staying at Mirage  Rooms are not quite at all all doors are making a lot of noise when ppl leaving the rooms and the fire time it’s make noise a lot too low quality furniture but price wise and location it’s great
20,This was my first visit to Vegas. A lot of my complaints are common to all hotels on the strip and I understand that Mirage is set for demo in the future so they haven’t been doing any regular updates due to that. Generally speaking I resent being nickeled and dimed for every single little creature comfort. If they want you to gamble they shouldn’t try so hard to take all your money at the door. The minibar had no prices listed anywhere. You will pay an exorbitant daily fee for the luxury of refrigerating any personal items. The phone is so old I had to call the 70’s to reach housekeeping and speak through what sounded like a tin can underwater. The key card system for the elevators is a minor annoyance but for some guests who had friends on different floors it’s actually a huge problem. I also encountered a guest who was trying to use the digital card for the elevator and she kept getting stuck in the elevator that wouldn’t take her anywhere. This is also the first time I have ever had to put a security deposit for a hotel room which I wasn’t aware of or prepared for ahead of time. Apparently this hotel has a nice pool but there was no information about it how to access it if I even had access or had to pay extra how much it cost etc. It must be a huge secret.    I was here for a show at the convention center and while I might do that again I won’t be likely to ever return to the strip and I cannot recommend this particular hotel.
50,I had an issue with my room's AC unit as it was not cooling my room. The technician assigned to fix it showed up within 30 minutes. He was easy to talk to polite and resolved the issue very quickly.
50,I stayed for one night at the mirage in the two bedroom penthouse suite. I had a wonderful time and all the staff was super friendly and helpful. We also ate dinner at the Ostria Costa. It was amazing food I would definitely return. I do live in Las Vegas so I don’t know when my next stay will be but I would recommend staying here.
30,Rooms have no microwave coffee maker basic cutlery or mini fridge. I asked for plastic cutlery. Front desk said they would send it to my room but they never did!.. The TV and USB ports were not working when I got there. Front desk insisted that USB ports were intentionally disabled. I explained to them that I was not referring to the USB ports on the TV rather the ones that are used for charging but they insisted that those were also disabled. I asked them to fix the TV. It was clear to me that the power strip just needed to be recycled. They fixed the TV and that fixed the USB ports as well.
50,It was so great to get a few nights for free with MyVEGAS. The front desk staff helped a ton to make it happen. Craig was very helpful and very polite. We also had a very sweet woman at the Box Office booth help us with our tickets.
20,Old rooms - wasn’t busy so not a lot of table games opened. Hard to play. Ended up playing most of the time at Cesar’s. Not sure I would stay there again. I use to live this place. Hopefully Seminoles will make it great again.
40,I love this hotel. I needed a getaway from the world!! This is my happy place. I didn't get the room l had previously asked for but it's OK. Will be back! Heritage steak and the pantry are still great and l enjoyed myself as usual.
50,The location is perfect. The smell and feel of the resort was like a tropical getaway. The restaurants were tasty and reasonably priced. Service poolside was excellent. Had a terrific time and hope to come back very soon.
30,Rooms are outdated. Beds are not comfortable. Dresser in room drawers will not stay closed. Can not store your own drinks in refrigerator. Not enough cover and on bed. Only had a couple of sheets. Steak restaurant is very good at Mirage.
50,The Mirage has always been our favorite property to stay at in Vegas. The atmosphere is exciting yet calming at the same time. The slots and table games are always fun! The beds are comfortable and there is a good selection of restaurants. I love this casino!!
40,Youngest turned 21 and we rented 3 rooms. Rooms were spacious but a little dirty. The tables and slots needed to wiped down a lot more. The restaurants on the premise were great. The drinks were amazing.
50,This was our first time in Vegas and the Mirage definitely set the bar for future Vegas trips. The staff was helpful and friendly..and they even comped our most expensive night plus late check out when our elevators broke due to a busted water pipe. The pool was a relaxation sanctuarywith bar service and great music being a plus. I highly recommend the Mirage.
50,Price was Good. Reasonable. They Kept me and my family together in separate rooms. The Beds were Comfortable TV quality was great. The Pool was amazing. We had a great time and it was around everything
40,Hotel nice enough however a little dated. Tough to keep up with newest glitz and glamour.Hotel has many restaurants and amenities. Sushi restaurant on property is highly recommended. Service and food both excellent.
40,I have been going for many years. So sorry to see it go. Vegas has changed so much and not necessarily for the good. I liked when you would dress up to go to dinner and a show. Now its shorts & flip flops. the Mirage was my favorite hotel and now have to find a new one.
20,There are better hotels on the strip with better service. As someone who is an MGM member I thought I’d receive better service. Front desk isn’t that great. Takes forever for them to answer calls. When I called to check out and question our bill the front desk said “this is a warning you can’t use the fridge for personal use”
20,Why bother? Don't come unless you're prepared to pay insane prices for basics essentials and Amy on-site eating. They actively make it hard to bring your own items - so bring a cooler or your own mini fridge. The hotel has no means of easy travel to other spots on the strip. It's set back from the strip itself so unless you're prepared for a ton of walking plan on paying for Lyfts.    Vegas has changed I won't be back for leisure travel.
50,Beautiful place. Great and friendly staff. Wonderful massage therapist! Phenomenal food. Awesome bartenders. Loose slots. Well kept garden and immaculate rooms. Amazing views of the strip and quick access to everything!
50,Wonderful place wonderful time memories!! Would definitely recommend this establishment just because of the vibe within the love show was excellent and we got to meet some neat dolphins as well as some great people we will most likely never see again. It felt like we were in a tropical paradise with an ocean right nearby not even knowing we were in the middle of a desert!
30,Our room was nice big king bed and had a beautiful view of the mountains. We saw Beatles Love and were impressed by the athleticism of the artists and how entertaining the show was. The show was fun from start to finish. I highly recommend. Also try restaurant Osteria for fresh house made pasta. So good!  The only criticism I have is that we wasted almost $200 USD on reserved seating at the main pool. If you wait around until early afternoon you can apparently get the seating for free as the attendants don’t check. There were guests without bracelets who kept sitting in our ‘paid’ section without paying and nobody did anything when we informed the desk twice. They couldn’t have cared less. I don’t usually tattle but it’s a lot of money and it’s a big slap in my face when we are honest and others can get away with cheating/stealing by taking reserved seating without paying and nobody does anything about it. It’s insulting. That is why I didn’t give it a 4 star. It left a very bitter taste in my mouth. It’s $200 that I could have used elsewhere.    Big shout out to Heather our pool-side server who was very friendly and attentive and checked in on us regularly. She was great! Also to the shy attendant who took us to our reserved seating and respectfully set aside the belongings of the people who were using the seats that we had paid for. She set up our chairs with towels until the people came over to grab their stuff. She was very patient and it lessened our annoyance and helped us to take a breath because she was so calm.    Thanks!
50,If you are looking for a centrally located resort that is not overwhelmingly big and has everything you need with very friendly employees The Mirage is for you. The Mirage also has the nicest pool on the strip.
40,My sister girlfriend her daughter and I went to Las Vegas for a girl’s trip. We stayed at the Mirage and had awesome  stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The location is perfect it is in the middle of the strip.
50,Clean hotel no matter the time of day..  Front desk made checking in so easy. Lauren was the best! Every member of staff was so friendly!  Walking distance to strip. Comfortable room. Housekeeping came every day.
30,Everything at the Mirage cost money and has a fee attached. We had a food and Beverage credit for $50 and spent only $35 of it but we were charged the amount of tip to the bartender in addition. Also elevator is hit or miss on getting to your floor. There are times it skips the floor or just goes partway before returning to the lobby. Being that my home town doesn't have elevators we enjoyed spending the day doing Mystery rides
50,Great prices great ameneties to eat and affordable and they have great staff. Rooms are large and comfortable and great view of the property and the las vegas strip and the various properties and attractions in the region.
30,Was supposed to get a complimentary stay and still paid for other fees. It wasn’t much but it is principle. Then gets placed in a room that is over a/c units. My buddies laughed. With just a 2 night stay I spent $1000’s on gaming and food. Thanks for the hospitality
50,Love Love Love The Mirage!! Ive been staying here for thirty years!! Beautiful pool area friendly guests & staff members. Sad to see that the name is changing and Hard Rock is taking over. I hope they improve it but not take away the good charateristics this property provides
50,Couldnt fault the hotel we flew with our daughter and 10 year old grandaughter from UK for 1 week . Everywhere was super clean  no problems with rooms King tower rooms both with strip views and we had a pool and strip view. The best pool on the strip and we needed it as it was 107 degrees  too hot for walking around in the day and even hot at night. Ate at the Paradise Pool restaurant every morning for breakfast which was excellent ( not The Pantry where the food and coffee was cold ). I recommend the Deuce or Uber for getting around both great value . Shame the mirage is being taken over  I would go back here . I hope they keep that pool
10,Room had toenails on the floor black hair on the shower walls (both my friend and I are blonde) windows had hard prints on them. Felt sorry and rooms are not anywhere as nice as advertised. Okay I’ll not be back
50,What a grand hotel and casino!! It's beautiful from the moment you step in. It's very clean and fresh looking. We visited other casinos while we were visiting and they were dumps. The pool area was so nice. We ate at Pantry Diablo's Cantina and Snacks which I highly recommend.  The staff were so friendly and helpful. I felt very comfortable here.
50,I took a trip to Las Vegas to stay specifically at the Maroge because I heard that it was switching to a hard rock hotel and I am saddened by that so I wanted to give the Maroge my business one last time. Fantastic location close to everything few changes with the restaurants this time. Overall an outstanding property
50,I travel twice a year to Vegas and ALWAYS stat at the Mirage - top notch in cleanliness friendliness location value great bed and shower only wish they would update the casino to more popular card games with the enhanced progressives
40,The mirage doesn’t disappoint. It has the old style feel but is super modern still. The tv in your room says you can connect devices to the tv and change inputs to watch your own streaming device but that didn’t work for me so don’t bother bringing your fire stick. Your tv is limited to law and order reruns and ghost shows on the travel channel if you need tv in Vegas .
30,The casino restaurants and pool were fine. The rooms need to be cleaned and deep cleaned. Along with update the carpet curtains and bathrooms. First tim staying at Mirage with family. It wasnt horrific but dont think we will be going.
30,Hotel was very mediocre. I have stayed at other MGM properties and have been wowed consistently. No restaurants are open after 10pm. If you want food you need to go to a snack bar that charges 8 dollars for a fountain soda. I understand vegas is expensive but that was ridiculous.
10,Checked in late after playing slots for a few hours. The person checking me in was very low energy and lifeless just shaking her head yes or no when I had asked her questions. There was also a shift manager who mentioned to the woman checking me in that she was going “to take my 30 (minute break) to smoke and piss”....charming. Also after gambling for 4 hours+ had not one cocktail waitress ask me if I wanted a drink I actually ended up buying one at the bar due to how scarce they all were.    Room was clean and bed was comfortable enough no problems there.
40,Nothing special it was okay experience . Next time will try different hotels . Lift was not working. No personal refrigerator in the room . Have to call room service for cleaning . Don’t know how to redeem comps
50,I would like to give Jaylene M 5 stars for the service at check in for myself and my Wife .she upgraded our room to a Suite and it was fabulous. This was a memorable experience at the Mirage. Thanks Jaylene M .I am retired and I worked as a manager for 33 years in hospitality industry. She is a great asset to MGM resorts Co.  I have stayed at several properties thru out my career .She made this stay one to remember.
10,I found a cockroach in my room! and nobody have taken in seriously for that issue i had to talk to 3 people from the front desk but nobody cared at all. i show them the video about the cockroach nobody cared and try to solve the problem. So DISSAPOINTED.  it means the hotel has no credibility and have zero tollerance about cleanliness and customer satisfaction.  Will not reccomend The Mirage at all.
40,Room was clean and spacious. We did get a room next to all the air conditioning units so it was loud. We also had a room that was a HIKE to the elevators. It’s seemed like a goofy set up. We were able to check in and out all from our phone and used a digital room key the entire time. Bed was very comfortable. There were 24/7 food options available in the hotel which is nice in a pinch. We didn’t get to visit the pool this trip so I can’t review that but we would stay again!
50,I was surprised to see that this hotel was not bad at all I normally stay at bállagio palazo of the wyn . Do you Can only imagined what I thought I was running into lol  But overall it was great the staff was AWESOME and that made a huge difference!
50,Location is great easy to walk to any other location. Nice casino and great show (Love by Beatles) good restaurant selection inside the hotel. Wish they didn’t have captive dolphins but hopefully that goes away when new guitar hotel is build!
50,The Mirage was a great hotel. It suited our over 55 group fine. Check in was kind of chaotic but they got us all on the same floor which is a miracle in itself. The only drawback was that we had to go buy a cooler to keep cold water and soda in our room. We were advised that the room fridge was weighted and pricey.
30,Really wish there was a coffee maker. Never have I stayed in a hotel that didn’t have one. Most people don’t want to get ready and out the door to get that first cup of joy. Also would have liked to warm up our leftovers in a microwave
50,This is my FAVORITE resort mainly because of the nature surroundings and the waterfalls. I am in LOVE with waterfalls and it makes for a peaceful and relaxing stay. The pool is the main reason why I stay at the Mirage. I have never had a bad experience staying here.
50,The Mirage has always been our place to stay in Las Vegas.The first time we came to LV in 1989 the Mirage was the new resort on the strip and we loved it at first sight. The Volcano is awesome and the pool area is one of the best in LV. The Mirage has such a tropical feel to it from the smell of coconut when you walk in the doors to the lush flowers and plants and palm trees in the atrium. The aquarium behind the check-in desk is amazing! The employees are so friendly and helpful too. You don't have to walk a mile to get to the restaurants or the pool. The rooms are always clean and quiet. The Mirage is close to everything.
30,Rooms were nice and prime location. The reason for my lower rating because one of their ATMs gave me a damaged $100 bill. I didn’t notice until I was at the airport and I now am out $100 and have to send this bill to the Department of Treasury.
40,Really nice stay overall friendly staff good restaurants great location. Only gripe for early risers like myself - they completely close off the pool area when it isn't open. In all the resorts I've stayed in I have never seen this before. In the morning I like to take my coffee outside and sit on a lounge chair and watch the sunrise. Not here. Not only is it roped off but they also have a guard to make sure you do not enter. That leaves you sitting on a hard slab of cement. Forget about going inside everywhere the music (at 5:00am really?) is BLASTING. Why? I suggest they setup part of the pool area with some chairs for people who want a little peace and quiet and enjoy the morning sun
10,Molding room we got sick could not sleep no one fixed the problem we couldn't stay in the room  Checking is young lady was very nice did her job well!!! Quality of food wasn't worth the prices!!! Show wasn't very good!!!
50,We were ecstatic to stay at the Mirage again. Have visited almost annually since its existence. Beautiful atmosphere great staff fun resort. BUT this visit we discovered that this resort is being sold by MGM to Hard Rock. This was a heartbreaker.    We understand that the new owner will remove the iconic volcano construct a new building addition and obviously redo all existing structures.    Nice but Hard Rock is not our style or interest. We treated this trip as a “grand finale” tribute to the Mirage. We will miss it greatly.
50,The mirage give us the Vegas experience all around next to the strip the casino felling and the rooms are great it sure make u feel like some what old school Vegas but more modern and we love it. Sad to see it go to hard rock but I guess that’s not to our decision.
20,price is good but ummm do not feel like returning to this one. Did not have a good experience for checking in and the room smells a little bit. The water is either too hot or too cold and not controablle (the sink in the bathroom). please fix it for room 21092
50,We had a problem with check in and they resolved the issue above and beyond. The room pool and service was great. We have been going to this resort for over 20 years and we will definitely be returning.
50,Amazing Stay!!! We had the time of our lives! The room was perfect for us we had a volcano view! All the staff was friendly and helpful from the moment we walked through the doors until the time we left! Even holding our bags until our flight left after check out!!
50,Wonderful atmosphere. Stayed 3 times this past year and enjoyed every time. The 4 restaurants we tried were delicious the service was outstanding. The rooms are clean and the bed is comfortable. The staff on the casino floor always around and always acknowledged you. Had a wonderful time all 3 stays !!!!
40,We arrived in mid August for 4 nights when it was August hot of course. Our room overlooked the volcano and the lower strip towards Wynn. The room was great with exception of pillows; those need updating. But clean and attractive with wonderful housekeepers. We ordered room service from the Pantry; excellent and large portions. Costa restaurant was lovely and the food was terrific. Outstanding service. The Still was good very casual. Oasis private pool for a day; Dana was terrific and provided stellar service. The casino was empty during the day not super crowded at any time. Great security service staff and accomodations. Will return!
10,Lots of trouble at check in - unclean room and no resolution provided. It was difficult to digest that it’s MGM brand hotel but location is pretty nice plus we enjoyed the volcano show. Other than that - it was not a pleasant experience
30,Lack of communication about the check in process was not simple at all and was not properly handled when asked to speak to a manage on 3 separate occasions until some of the alleviation came as the frustration was realized
50,Perfect location. The lobby is beautiful like a hawaiian paradise. If you want to save cash you can easily walk across the street (past Rhumbar) and hit up the Walgreens for Beer water and anything else you need. The Linq is right across the street. Pretty overall convenient location.
40,Stayed at the mirage with some friends. They arrived a day earlier than us and when we arrived were able to put our things in their room till ours was ready. Spent lots of time at the pool during the day. Enjoyed lunch at the pool two days as well. At nights we went out to dinners to enjoy the cooler Temps. Late night was reserved for gambling. Was not super busy this weekend and was able to enjoy all amenities. If you have a certain restaurant get reservations or you will not eat where you want to that night
50,4th stay at this hotel in the past few years. Clean and quiet. Beds are very comfortable. Pool is excellent very relaxing and landscaped well.Good location on the strip and access. Parking is directly adjacent to hotel and convenient. Plan to return again.
50,We stayed at the Mirage for a quick overnight stay. We used the online checkin and parking feature for self parking and didn’t have to wait in any lines for checkin. Very convenient! The property was central to what we wanted to see and was easy to navigate. We felt safe during our stay and our room on the be well floor was clean and well appointed. We will stay here again!
30,Dealers at the casino were terrible the gave me the wrong amount of chips several times. Even if I won a hand they would take my chips. Room service always came at the worst times and the staff at the Mirage did little to help us.
50,Front desk especially Azzie was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. At all three restaurants the service and food was great. The 'Love' show was beyond exceptional. I might have been somewhat biased from the beginning because the Beatle's are my all time favorite band but my son and his girlfriend (both in their 20's) loved it as well.
50,Had a great 3 night stay. Check in was easy. I requested my room to be close to my friend who I was traveling with and they put us right next to each other which was very nice. Hotel was clean and very large. Lots of restaurants to eat at and the pool was very enjoyable and big. My room was on the 24th floor which was very spacious and clean. The bed is so comfy. Loved that the hotel is central on the strip. I would definitely stay here again.
10,When we first walked in there was trash still in the room. I called housekeeping and they said someone cleaned it but I not sure if they did.    Then as we stayed there longer the sink was clogged so we had to get ready in the shower and one of the lights in the bathroom wasn’t working (took pictures for proof)    I also left an earring and asked lost and found it they found it but I think someone stole it. I know I left it and exactly where I left it.
50,"The hotel was great. We loved the Oasis pool and the dolphin and tiger exhibits. Very easy access to the rest of ""the strip"". Easy to get a cab from the hotel. The volcano show was very entertaining. We had a lovely stay!"
10,We stayed at the Mirage for a ballroom competition. The choice to stay there was perceived convenience of the hotel room to the ballroom. This room was so far away that we had to lug all of our costumes down to a bathroom near the ballroom. When we arrived our bathroom floors were dirty (sticky spots where something was dropped and then dirt sticks to it) and the carpet is visibly dirty and gross. The good news is the beds were comfortable and clean. We were disappointed that instead of a little fridge it was a stocked expensive mini bar. Also super disappointed that the pool closed at 6:00…. Not great for kids wanted to play. There is a parking fee and the parking is quite far from any rooms. Also the resort fee is added each day. A total waste. This place was just not worth it.
10,Was lied about upgrade on room  Room was dirty old bathroom was nasty  Not happy at all and I had to stay in it because the hotel was book  Not happy at all I come here every year for a long time I have never had a bad experience but I don’t like to b lied to and treated like this
30,The restaurant staff was helpful. However there was no coffee maker in the room. Also there were no attempts to grant a late check out and I was there as part of a large dance competition and would have much preferred to shower and take my hair down before flying out later. in the day.
50,This was our first stay at The Mirage and our first visit in 5 years. It was very nice there and exceptional service. Thing I didn't like - there seemed to be an unusual amount of children in the casino; even some at the machines with their parents. Never saw anyone speak to any about that.
20,Acceptable as long as you know what you’re getting into. Location gives them a pass with the poor overall value and service. Staff generally unhelpful and there to basically just manage through the day. Some exceptions are the cabana staff at the pool (very attentive) and some bar staff—there are some excellent bartenders available. On the down side so w of the restaurant staff is average to poor with accommodating guests. Example: our part of 7 could t get seated at the bar/grill due to lack of availability. (can’t remember name) until I produced $40 to the hostess. We were seated immediately. Overall The Mirage is an aging dinosaur and no longer a resort. It’s a hotel with a pool and some restaurants.
50,Beautiful hotel with all kinds of attractions to look at in and outside of the hotel. Location is great to plenty of food choices right across the street. I would definitely consider coming back here on my next visit for a longer stay then one night lol
50,We went to the Mirage to go to see Beatles ❤️Love. Everything went very good. Great show. We will always go to the Mirage. Our room was clean and comfortable. Las Vegas is a fun place to visit. We also went to the Omelette House. Yummy!
50,From check in to check out it was a fun filled great experience. The staff and room couldn’t have been better. We were able to check in when we arrived at 7am. Luggage was brought to the room within five minutes. The room was large and comfortable. Great time.
10,Worst rooms and worst service.hotel customer service could only reached after 30 mins    They repaired ac after long time our stay was only for one day room was fully smoke smell .worst room ever .  No rest room locks
50,Two bedroom penthouse luxury specialists limo rides incredible restaurants and food great casino atmosphere! Wow what an incredible mom/daughter vacation! Had so much fun created great memories to last a lifetime. Highly recommended. First visit to The Mirage! Wow thanks!
40,Very good location on the Strip. Very nice pool area. No shopping mall but very close to Forum @Caesars and Venetian Canal shoppes which gives you all you need and a lot more. My teenagers will love to stay here again
50,Omg the food at the pantry is great!!!  The Still for bar food you can’t pass up  No homeless people wandering around  No thug wearing people walking around even after hours.. Mirage is the best place to stay on the strip. If your a mgm member ask for scott poster. I’m pretty sure he will give tips on how to lv up. I went from new card member to platium on my stay my first visit 2 months ago!
50,Haven't stayed at Mirage in years. Now I can't remember why. It was a clean well appointed room obviously in the middle of all the action on the strip. Self serve diner called Snacks has an awesome Reuben and tots :-P . Pool is a fun setting. Mostly though I was very impressed with the staff. More and more with everything going on in the world it is hard to find great staff. I had several experiences with staff that made an impression on me.
40,Overall everything went good would have liked to see more comps on alcohol while playing in the casino (scarce to no cocktail waitresses) I did like the couple machines and loved playing with the wife.
40,A friend of mine and I stayed at the Mirage specifically because it's the only place I've ever stayed in Vegas and I've always loved it. When I heard they were turning into a Hard Rock Cafe I was sad but had plans to see a rock concert at Mandalay Bay so I made sure to book a room here one last time before the change. Everything was excellent except the cleanliness of our room. I realize they offer late check-out which is great but may be the reason things were not up to par. Found candy on the floor and some of the bedding didn't look clean. The windows to my view were dirty from the outside so taking a picture of it was nearly pointless. Als9 I was shocked to find no coffee maker in the room forcing me to go downstairs looking ragged to buy Starbucks. and even worse he fridge was locked. So my left overs from a nice restaurant went to waste. Overall the stay was excellent and I enjoyed myself but regardless if the Mirage was changing to a different venue I would probably choose to stay somewhere else next time.
30,We got the room that was ALL the way at the end.. we had a 2 year old - seemed like forever to get to the room.  Check in was great on the app. Easy to get a room key as well.  Room wasn’t that clean . Clothes from the previous guest were still on the chair that was pushed u see the desk. So you know the room wasn’t cleaned that well.
50,Our stay at the Mirage was fantastic! The staff was so helpful and professional. Our room had a beautiful view of the strip! The pool was so enjoyable and so fun to spend time at. We LOVED the dolphin habitat and Secret Garden in property! Also we enjoyed the Beatles Love show in property!! Everything was excellent!!
50,Had a wonderful time and would come again. Everything was clean. All staff was very helpful answer all questions and giving directions when needed. Rooms were nice and plenty of space to move around. 👍
30,I chose it for being central. The mirage is supposed to be an upscale hotel and price seemed fair.  Pros:  Center strip  It’s clean.  The employees are great  pool is awesome but fills up quickly.    Cons  When someone talks in the hall it’s as if they are in your room. Door is not thick and zero soundproof.  I could hear the room beside me flush chat and slam all cabinets and doors  Bathroom was super small.
50,Great location! The casino is clean and staff is wonderful!  The rooms are spotless and you’ll sleep like a baby on the amazing beds! Also love the rewards program!!Mirage is our hotel of choice whenever we’re in Vegas!
50,This is a great property and the staff is ultra-friendly. The LOVE show is one that needs to be seen before it ends. Gaming is good and dealers extremely helpful really feel like they're on your side.
50,Were here to celebrate birthdays that were missed last year. My 70th and our son's 40th. Also to celebrate husband's 75th birthday this year and daughter-in-laws 40th. Was a great vacation and truly enjoyed. Loved the pool and all the staff were great.
10,You’re taking your chances staying here. You should be skeptical just cause the price doesn’t seem that bad the stay for my family was horrible! The tub was disgusting! Lost and found will not return four lost items at all! They were not helpful!
50,I am currently staying at The Mirage and its fabulous. Place is clean. Staff are very courteous. It's not smoky either. Pool is why people come here and it does not disappoint. If you can the Oasis pool is worth the extra coin. Thanks to Seth and Dana for taking care of us. Couple of more things...wellness room is great and the location on the Strip can't be beat. Sometimes think people forget we are just coming out of a pandemic so who cares if you don't get fresh towels everyday or the resturaunts may have special hours. Check out The Mirage before it becomes the Hard Rock.
50,Great location centre strip and we love the pool! Room was clean and well maintained. Check out the spa it was awesome! I went for a massage and stayed in the sauna after very relaxing and fantastic customer service.
40,Pool was awesome. The rooms were very clean. The food in Diablos Cantinas was delicious and the service was superb. The ceviche was on point. The birria tacos were super good. The drinks rocked and the service was super quick.
30,Parking! You had to pay daily or every time you left the lot I felt this was totally ridiculous whn your already paying a daily deposit and resort fee so whn you arrive expect to dig deep into your pocket
50,From the moment you arrive the smell of the casino and hotel is breathtaking! The cleanliness and friendliest staff makes it an enjoyable stay! The pool is beautiful and arriving early in the day made it very easy to grab a chair!
50,Penthouse suite is so nice! We had a two bedroom and was so large nicely decorated and super quiet to get a great night sleep. The room's certains can be used to totally darken the room so you can sleep in late. Really love the central location of Mirage in the middle of the strip too.
40,Pity … no more poker room and no more buffet too …  Except for that thé stay was perfect. Swimming pool is still the best of the City thé mirage still have the best location on the strip.  Récommended if youre Not a poker player
10,Switch room to a different floor and was  Given a key to a room with guest still in room after switching to a different floor and room and split up from son and family. With a statement that we can not promise to accommodate the room request. But you can give me a room with other guest in the room WOW.
10,The room was not up to standard for a hotel of this stature. I expect more from the management team to ensure a successful stay and potential return from clients planning to come back and spending a tremendous amount of money. Shame on them this is not acceptable.
30,Great staff but the property is tired and run down. Half the restaurants are either not open or on limited hours. Rooms need to be updated. Hopefully the sale will go through and this once great property will get the attention it deserves.
50,We had a great stay at the Mirage. The pool was awesome! There was a Starbucks we visited twice a day. The rooms were clean and comfortable. It was nice coming back to our room at the end of our long days to relax.
50,Everything was perfect. Except I couldn’t use the mini fridge to keep my meds. The receptionist mentioned that the mini bar is so sensitive you will be charged if you touch the items inside. The pool was awesome.
50,From the cleanliness of the rooms to the east of self service at the tap of your phone the mirage is one of my favorite hotels on the strip. Always my number one choice and I am never disappointed. Will be back again soon
40,The hotel has a great pool with a huge waterfall. Restaurants are very good and friendly staff. Since alot of the clientele is Asian the sofas and chairs in the suites are small. If you are a larger person or have arthritis it will take extra effort to get in and out of the furniture. Also the sofas and chairs have no arms - makes it even harder. The location of the hotel is great for visiting other hotels.
50,The Mirage is a great location on the strip. Relatively limited restaurants at hotel but many choices within walking distance. The rooms are slightly dated but clean. I wish it was completely non smoking. staff is friendly -
50,I have been to Vegas many times but stayed at the Mirage for the first time on this visit. The Mirage was the best hotel by far. Everyone was so friendly and helpful.the restaurants were great. I would stay there again.
30,This was the third time I stayed at the property …. It’s one of the nicest pool in Vegas and the location is perfect ! The size of the resort is good too. The fixtures are a little dated but in good condition. I imagine we will see some changes now that the Hard Rock owns the property I probably won’t be able to afford to stay there anymore lol
40,I live in Las Vegas and know what to expect when staying on the strip. Would have given a 5 star rating if I didn't find a sock that didn't belong to me and if the room didn't smell musty. Staff is great!! Professional and friendly. I know that all the casinos are experiencing labor shortages but cleanliness of rooms and funny odors can not be overlooked. I didn't bother to complain it never gets me anywhere but frustrated.
10,I lost my cell phone and in attempting to find it made three short phone calls. These three very short calls racked up $100 in charges. This is ridiculous! We were on a trip for my nephew's wedding and I left my phone in his honeymoon suite. In attempting to retrieve it I never dreamed these three very short calls would be charged such a large amount.
50,The Mirage is always my destination spot to go to when in Las Vegas. The Hotel is right smack in the middle of the strip so walking distance is pretty much close to everything. The staff is always amazing the rooms are great with awesome views and can I say that they have the BEST POOL in Vegas cause they do and get yourself one of their pina coladas if you're poolside cause they are the so good !
50,"I have enjoyed decades as a guest at the Mirage. I am saddened to know that this reign will be coming to an end as the property has been sold . I hope that some how some way that I will find a new ""home"" in Las Vegas for my many business trips."
50,Tropical and relaxing vibes plenty to drink and activities for the kids. I recommend the very affordable secret garden and dolphin habitat.    I won a jackpot at the Casino and after being there for 3 days and nights it wasn't uncomfortably busy or crowded.
20,They tack on added fees for resort fees and parking. We booked through Costco travel and had prepaid. We were there for 4 nights and had to pay an additional $448 before even getting checked in. Only $200 was refunded when we checked out. Parking is $18/day. No free parking for hotel guests. Pool is only open until 6pm which seems ridiculous when it is still 90 degrees at 11pm. There was mold and mildew in the shower in the grout and around the grab bars. Loudest toilets ever- you have to either wake everyone up or not flush until the morning. There are no microwaves refrigerators or coffee makers in the room. If you want a refrigerator you have to pay a fee to have one brought to your room.
50,I have been staying at the Mirage for over 20 years now. Size of the Hotel and the Casio is perfect for what I want. There are plenty of food options and the location on the strip is great. The staff *
50,Amazing swimming pools and amenities in the property. Amazing shows and dolphin habitat onsite. Close to everything even if you wanted to go around and visit other locations it’s just a short cab or Uber ride over. Rooms was clean nice and cool to my liking and great smelling shampoo and conditioners lol the little things in life!
50,Very clean and very friendly staff. Housekeeping does a great job of cleaning your rooms early so that they’re clean when you return. Restaurants inside the mirage are also great options. Overall great experience
20,Pros: Room was ok with king bed flatscreen tv and good drawer space for clothes. Small bathroom but it works. Great location close to Dennys Walgreens The Mall and other hotels like Caesars Palace Venetian Paris and Bellagio for better dining options. Location of Cirque du Soleil LOVE (The Beatles). Bartender Matt at the Dolphin Bar is very polite and friendly.    Cons: Hotel appears dated. Not enough sun beds at the pool - seems like people are reserving sun beds but don’t return and crew does nothing. Worst; limited shade options - probably around 8-12 sun beds have natural shade. The rest you are in direct sun. You can reserve a pair of normal suns bed with an umbrella for $140/day. You can also get a “cabin” for an even more ridiculous amount. Limited good dining options at hotel.  No where to sit. I will write this again: there’s no where you can sit at the hotel inside. No sofas no chairs. Not even at the reception - imaging your grandmother or dad has difficulty walking and they need to rest…  Room cleaning or lack of. Nothing first day. Had to complain. Nothing second day. Had to complain - you would think they had taken note. Have to ask them every day to remind them. And no we didn’t have the Privacy sign hanging on the door.  Safe didn’t work when we checked in to room. Immediately called and they sent Security. Battery change needed so Security/Reception would send an engineer next day morning. No problem except they didn’t so we had to call again.    Special note on Dolphin habitat: Not a fan of businesses having animals in captivity so not a fan of Mirage’s commercialization dolphin for $100 “meet and greet $200 for a “paining session” $450 for “dolphin trainer 101”. Stupid exploitation. I think they also have tigers. Don’t get me started on that…  If I we had known this before booking we wouldn’t have stayed here.    We won’t come back. Can’t recommend.
40,Had a great experience. Great room on the 21st floor with view of the strip. I really liked the location it was walking distance to all attractions. Room was super clean just the down side was I needed a fridge. I always need cold water on hand!
50,The staff at the Mirage were friendly courteous and very professional and each one went out of their way to accommodate my requests. The pool is delightful and aesthetically appealing and the room was well maintained and spotless. I highly recommend this resort to new guests.
40,Great hotel just needs more games and a poker room. The services was great and the rooms were also very nice. The location is also close to better hotels to save you money if you want to explore them or gamble
10,My husband and I picked the Mirage as our last room in Vegas for our honeymoon. We were told at check-in that we'd been upgraded to a resort tower king with a view of the volcano which was really great of Shelly. The room wasn't ready yet but she said we'd get a text by 3 pm. 3pm came around and no text so we went back to the front desk. The man there said we hadn't been upgraded after all and when I expressed confusion he offered to waive the resort fee. Then the manager approved the upgrade. Ok great right?    The room we were given had a lovely view...of the parking garage roof or something along those lines. That's it. It was adjacent to the ice machine and the elevators so all day and all night we heard the elevators whirr and ding and the ice machine being used. All. Night.    The bed was not very comfortable and I had to ask twice for a second sheet to be brought up. The hair dryer was broken in the back the tub faucet was coming off of the wall and there wasn't a plug on one of the sides of the bed. On top of everything at check out we were still charged the resort fee.    Safe to say I'm incredibly disappointed. The Mirage has a good reputation but we should have stayed at the Cosmopolitan another night where we felt valued.
20,While I understand the property has been sold I was shocked at how quickly the facilities deteriorated. Very dirty and run down. Even the pool area had broken and cracked concrete and a lot of debris in the pool. Sad to see it end up like this as the location was perfect and our favorite place to stay.
40,Always love the Mirage. Only complaint was the mattress needs replacing. Sagging in the middle and very uncomfortable. The food was excellent and we love the pool area. We would stay here again and probably get a suite for our next visit.
10,This place completely ruined our birthday which was august 10&11th. They overcharge our credit card $1700 at first then tried to charge another $300 plus but couldn’t explain why. We had to talk to the manager 5 times over 4 days constantly being told things are fixed but kept getting charges everyday. All those charges locked up our credit card leaving us with no money to soo basically anything. I don’t recommend you stay at this hotel. The rooms are basic as heck and don’t have a fridge or microwave so you’re forced to pay for those way over priced restaurants for every meal plus the restaurant selections are way better at almost every other hotel casino. DON’T STAY HERE!!
50,Very fast check-in and Your staff were very accommodating with ensuring I had the room of my choice. The hotel was very clean the housekeepers did a very good job of keeping my room clean and fresh.  I look forward to my next visit to the Mirage
10,I had to switch my room twice and still paid for my stay. My room was also downgraded instead of being updated. Then when I went to check out it took forever to figure out what had happened. This was an overwhelming trip I couldn’t even enjoy my trip because I had so many room issues.
20,Received push back from the staff when called to report a broken master shower in the suite we were paying a premium for. They were rude and condescending and sent someone after the fact to fix. The point tho is we didn’t enjoy the benefit of a bathroom the first night of getting ready to go out and all had to share the other one - not a huge deal in the grand scheme of life but even LESS of a deal for the hotel to graciously comp us back half the room rate for that night (at a minimum)….a room is two things: a bed and a shower. Half wasn’t functional for 1 of 2 times needing it. The math is simple.
50,The Mirage is in a great location for the day and night clubs. Really appreciate the lobby and the window ceiling dome and water fountain. Sadly I have found out that the Mirage will be taken over by another company. Hoping it can meet the expectations just as good or better than the Mirage.
20,Stayed there for three days and never had my roomed cleaned. They woke me up to ask when they could clean the room and still no ever did. Staff was OK in person but nothing stood out compared to the cheaper hotels on the strip. The carpet in my room was old and gross
20,The rooms need updating. Housekeeping was the best staff we encountered. Won’t be coming back. I’m sure there are better places to stay at this rate. Access to the strip is great though and taxi line moved fast.
10,Made to feel inferior did not disclose information about additional fees .Very Condescending . Told me the manager is going to tell me the same thing when I asked for the manager.Lost comp points. Horrible
50,Had an amazing trip and stay at the Mirage. Staff were always smiling and helpful and we received an upgrade at check in that was above and beyond. The suite we were given was beautiful and made our stay memorable.
30,Easy check-in friendly staff beautiful atrium clean comfortable room lovely pool area with complimentary towels (pool closed at 6:00 - much earlier than we expected so disappointed about how that played out with our schedule) conveniently located in the center of the strip & near the tram. Must walk through casino are to get to room elevators and it is darker and smelled heavily of marijuana and smoke.  No comfortable conversation areas to just sit and talk or wait for your party. The south entrance is by the crosswalk and while it makes it easy to access the strip there are always “naked showgirls” and drunk bums under the awning practically accosting you every time you come in and out. Use the other entrances to get a break from that.
40,My overnight stay at the Mirage was nice and comfy. The best part of my night was my evening meal at one of the hotel bars called the STILL it was there that I had the BEST quesadilla that I’ve ever eaten! This quesadilla was so good that I went back to this bar a couple of days later to have another one !
50,Great staff great people good vibe safe environment clean  the beds are great in the middle of everything food is close by almost everything is walking distance the fire show is awesome and I will sray here evertime I come it gonna be sad to see it go!!!
50,We had an absolutely wonderful stay at The Mirage. The service was outstanding. We especially enjoyed breakfast at Pantry specialty cocktails at Still and a lovely dinner at Stack. All employees were super polite and helpful. I had a perfect morning swim in the tropical pool. Hoping things don't change too much when Hard Rock takes over. Highly recommend!
30,With a huge report fee you'd expect to get coffee in your room. I get that casinos business model is to force the guests out to gamble but it just seems pretty egregious that the rooms don't include a Keurig.
30,Rooms are dated and could use some fresh decor and a cleaning. Comparing to other hotels the lower price at Mirage does not justify the tradeoff. Toiletries are very poor quality. Bathtub was very old and didn't seem clean.
40,We have stayed at multiple hotels in Vegas the Mirage was the best location easily walkable to all the other fun hotels around it. The restaurants were excellent the staff was wonderful. Table games staff were great funny and made playing enjoyable.
40,Mirage is a great location on the strip. It has some great restaurants and very friendly staff. Great weekend with friends and Mirage comped all 3 nights. Sad to see Mirage won’t be a hotel next time I’m there. Glad I got to stay one last time.
40,After being away because of Covid and health problems it was a happy return. Sadly not everything was opened buffet. I wished information on when places were opened or closed was more obvious. The pool was still beautiful and relaxing ( sorry to hear it will not be Mirage in the future). Yet a great trip
40,Amazing time with friends and had such a great time at the shows and shops. Food was great and so was the service. Casinos were so much fun. Staff were very helpful and I will be back to stay here in the future.
40,We had a great time staying in the resort. We loved the pool and we enjoyed the Limitless show. Stack and Pantry were both delicious. We also enjoyed watching the tigers play in the Secret Garden. We enjoyed being able to see the volcano from our room!
40,I've stayed in 8 different properties on the strip this one is a great value especially considering the location. It's very similar to Park MGM. The small crowded pool area was a little disappointing and the drink service in the casino has room for improvement but I will go back to this property for sure!
40,Staff could lose some attitude ridiculous costs for additional chairs at the pool but they still want to charge a resort fee as well. At least it was clean and the room was spacious. Food was pretty good.
40,My husband and I traveled to Vegas for my work; while. I went to trainings he got to relax The rooms were very clean and comfortable; the staff was well-informed courteous and guest-oriented; and the offerings: shows pool casino shopping restaurants/food etc. were fabulous and such that if you never wanted to leave the resort you didn't have to. Be prepared for the food to be quite pricey to keep a cooler in your room (the refrigerator is based on weight so you cannot use it) to eat cold leftovers (no microwave but the food still tasted good) to bring your own snacks for the room and to get to the pool early in the morning to get the seats you want (you can rent chairs/lounges/cabanas). Also check out the restaurants The Mirage offers in advance and make reservations ahead of time. There isn't anything that cannot be found in Vegas; it's just a matter of how much you're willing to pay.
50,Beautiful property! Love lounging at the pool and plenty of restaurants to choose from. The staff was very welcoming and accommodating. Overall our stay was very pleasant and would to come back to visit in the future.
30,"Good bed. Good shower pressure. Carpet frayed at entry way and needed a good shampoo. Lounge chair was spoiled andin need of a cleaning. I was unable to see the volcano show from my ""volcano view"" room."
50,Wonderful trip with great service food and shows!!!! The steakhouse was our favorite; try the prime rib. The Shin Lim & Colin Cloud show is a must see. We loved the pools our 29th floor suite the customer service etc.
50,Everything you could want. Beautiful pool exceptional goodz great shows very scenic. Casino right next to Ceasars palace so the mirage is right in the middle of everything. The volcano is fun to watch too
50,This was our 1 year anniversary trip we lucked out and came between two major rain storms so the weather was great. Had a great day by the pool and our waitress Heather rocked it. Didn’t win big but the overall trip was great.
10,The room was disgusting dirty. Dust everywhere. Pubic hairs in the tub dirty mirrors and stained sheets. The air conditioning did not work at all. And it was a comped room! I would never pay to stay In this crappy hotel Will never stay here again
40,Our stay was excellent I was part of a convention food was very good the staff was very friendly . just need some remodeling and some sections need to do a little more dusting in the rooms housekeepers were very friendly.
50,The staff were polite from checking in to checking out. we dis t have a fridge in oir room which when we asked they brought one up for no.extra charge. The pool was awesome and even on busy days it didn't seem busy. Food was good at the pool big portions so you can share. Rooms so clean.
40,Room was good. It was clean and comfortable. We missed the buffet. Thought food prices a bit high especially at Snacks. But food was very good. No prices showing for drinks in the little shop by the front desk. Crazy to pay $5.00 for a small bottle of milk. Wont do that again. Staff at all locations were very nice.
20,From start to finish not a good experience. We used mobile check-in went to our room and it was flooded. We couldn’t get someone on the phone had to go to the front desk and wait in line to then be moved to a dirty room with no view.
50,Great stay at the Mirage! Room was clean and in great condition and had a view of volcano. Mirage pool is gorgeous. Rented chairs and umbrellas were well worth the money when poolside. Hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. No complaints.
40,The mirage is a beautiful hotel. I think the bathroom in the room could have been a little cleaner. There were a couple of spots that were questionable. Overall a beautiful place. Had a staywell room and believe I did better than usual due to the cigarette/cigar smoke in Vegas. I do love the staywell option and will likely seek that on future visits. Everything is so expensive in Vegas anymore. Miss the old days of inexpensive buffets and free in room coffee
30,The room is small. Bathroom is small. It is nice because it is located in the center of Vegas strip. Casino is okay not big. Management and staff provide very good service and helpful . I would come back if I could get a bigger room.
10,Someone was murdered during our stay hotel staff/management failed or didn’t feel the need to notify us via text or email. I am pretty sure they rented out the room without telling the next occupant.Shame Shame Shame….
50,Every time we come to visit Vegas we always stay at the Mirage! We love the people and always treated very well! Will never stay anywhere else  Our room is always very clean and the staff try to accommodate any requests we have
50,Beautiful hotel and well staffed. We stayed for the first time because last year we stopped in and immediately decided we would stay the next time we came to town and we were glad we did. Blackjack was so much more fun because of our dealer (and for the life of me I’ve forgotten her name). But we would look for her when we wanted to play! The bartenders at the center bar great sense of humor and again very personable!!!! They made the trip.
50,My stay was absolutely wonderful . We ate at the Hereitage steakhouse and it was excellent. The waiter was very knowledgeable. The Shin Lim show Ed very good I was very happy. Thank you for a wonderful time.
50,Great location food options and great costumer service! We had. Great time meeting in Vegas with family. Centrally located gave is the option to visit other casinos walking. The staff was very friendly and always willing to help.
40,Nice clean hotel great location friendly staff. Only complaint was the noise in the hallway during the nights. Kept us up a lot. The pool was also overcrowded and needed a better system for seating. People saved seats early in the day which left none for those arriving after 10am.
50,Room was clean and serviced daily. Friendly staff.  Beautiful.  Tv was hard to navigate. Refrigerator was stocked and unless you knew you had to pay you could have gone broke.  Wish there was a coffee pot.
50,It was great stay we had a lot of fun our trip was just a regular vacation for us we had a good time while we were there. We will recommend this experience to our family and friends. We hope of visiting inthe near future.
50,Always have a great stay at the Mirage. One Bedroom Penthouse is nice and roomy. Love the casino and all of the restaurants have great food. Sad that they sold to Hard Rock and it will be no more. Private pool is a must for adults who like it a little quieter!
40,Comfortable and convenient. Typical stay twice a year. Rates good. Hate to learn that no longer be a part of M life group. Sounds like we may give one more visit as Mirage before Hard Rock takes over.
50,We did the Mobile check in and it wasawesomegot our room number and key right on the phoneroom was clean and everything we needed the hotel close to everything on the strip which made it easy to get around.
50,Very nice stay the entire staff was very pleasant and helpful wish we could go back sorry to see it go and the the lions and the dolphins was also great to see food was amazing as well but didn't win anything but a good time
40,I truly enjoy this hotel. It's a fun place full of plenty to do for everyone. It's central location is excellent which makes it a preferable place. The drinks are a little expensive but hey it's Vegas!
30,Friendly staff but property and rooms were dated. Resort restaurants and shops were over priced. However the pool was amazing and the hotel is conveniently located on the Las Vegas strip. Lots of slot machines but would prefer more classic slot machines.
50,Got the Stay Well room. Very comfortable bed fresh feeling room. Pool was great loved the waterfalls. All the food was good especially liked the Blizz. Easy walking to all the places I like to go in Vegas. All the staff were very nice. I'll stay again!
20,Hotel room was nice  upgraded to strip view . However it was the first hotel of any kind I stayed at with no coffee machine at all -which is a common staple at any hotel. Also considering that this is considered a luxury hotel a microwave with the mini bar would be helpful as well  again another common staple in any above average hotel. Beware of the mini bar: items are over priced and price list is conspicuously displayed on the hotel tv channel hotel better off getting stuff at Walgreens across the street or confectionery store in the hotel.
50,Clean rooms with great elevators. They are separated out by floors so you don't have to wait forever. Cocktails were good on the casino floor. Check in staff was great. Don't touch the snack bar in your room though cause it is touch sensitive. Casino machines paid ok
10,Disappointed in our stay was our first time going to the mirage and our last as well we Killed two roaches in our hotel room and  Our room was leaking water from the upstairs room just stay away not worth it
50,This hotel was absolutely amazing the staff were super friendly and knowledgeable they definitely know how to treat their guests. They went above and beyond with suggestions for my wife and I will stay there again
50,We were traveling with a large party and everyone was fantastic from the front desk to the bellhop. The rooms were clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend the Mirage.
20,Las Vegas has always been a favorite destination of mine however I’m finding it less of a place I want to spend my vacation time.  I think for the money people spend in Las Vegas good service should be a priority for every Hotel it’s what guests expect!
20,First there was a shooting and we were told to stay in our rooms with no explanation. I called the front desk multiple times talking to multiple people they wouldn't let us know why. I have a health condition and had to ask for food credit in order to eat.  Upon leaving the didn't apply the credit which left me standing in line again to correct the error.    I will never stay here again and advise others to not do the same.
30,The mirage has seen better days. Nothing is kept well anymore now that mgm is on their way out they are just grabbing as much cash as they can before hard rock takes over. I wouldn't go anywhere near this place until it gets rebranded......unless you want to take a trip back to the 90's
40,It stay was good. The show was good the food was so so. Front desk was no help give us a room we like. Missed my Lyft ride due to gun shooting and lock down. I most restaurants was closed. It was a good stay for the value. Resort fees is crazy
50,From the very start everything went great. Upgraded our room when our room was not ready. Housekeeping kept our room immaculate. The view of the strip from our room on the 27th floor was great. Even saw the volcano from our room. Only drawback was breakfast was a little expensive but then again this is Vegas.
40,The hotel is beautiful and the staff is great. Check in on app was so simple. The room was clean but sadly my bathroom was not. Hair on the floor bathtub didn’t drain and sink made noise. Recommend but make sure the bathroom is clean.
30,Our first room had water leaking. The first morning my wife got a piece of glass that wasn't cleaned up from the previous guest go through her toe.  2nd room had a broken thermostat so it was always hot.
20,Great location but the rooms are very outdated. Our tub would not drain. No one ever came to take a look at it. I managed to get it to drain. The bathroom had a strange odor. Definitely not a 4 star.
30,"Make a good inspection of your room on arrival. We found something puzzling on the sofa seat that made us feel queasy during our stay. Was it mayo...? or human discharge??? Regardless... You don't want to ruin your trip with being a Karen and trying to discover the source of a glaring housekeeping oversight. The next issue was ""glitches"" with mini fridge charges. My advice... Don't even breathe on that fridge or it will equate in $$$ being tacked onto your room charges. Another thing is... You'll have to twist some arms to have food and beverage credits applied. The whole ""skip the counter"" pitch... is in hopes that you skip checking if your credits were applied. I really wanted to have this be a regular thing but will likely stay somewhere else next visit."
30,Sad that an iconic MGM property will become an Hard Rock hotel. I will never stay here again knowing of this sale. Sad that MGM is forcing me to stay on the South side. Maybe it’s time to use my Caesars Rewards.
50,Second time staying at the Mirage. It was amazing! I love this hotel. Please don't change it. It's the best hotel on the strip. Love The Mirage the fresh lush green views the volcano and the pool.
10,Someone was shot and killed while I stayed there. The check in was slow. The staff in the casino were unfriendly and rude. The room (a 2 bedroom suite costing more than $1k per night) smelled like smoke. The only good thing I can say about my stay is that the hotel is in a good the location but so is every other hotel on the strip.    I will never stay here again.
50,Nice clean hotel the pool area was out favorite really relaxing and nice cascade 😀 i enjoyed the fast check in and out! No issues and all staff was polite during our stay! Towels were delivered quick when needed!
20,"Did not have the room I booked available upon check in. My best friends and I had a late flight in due to delays and I called earlier to check that my 2 Queen room would not be given away. I was told I had until 3 am. Got there at midnight-no more room. Was moved into a King and offered a roll-away bed. I was told it would be ""a better view"". I was thinking pool or something- nope..looking right at Trump Tower *barf*.  TV was not easy to get back tot the channel guide minibar priced were not listed anywhere not on the TV channel. Found out we couldn't use the refrigerator was told ""you need a code to charge for the use and anything inside oh and it's not for personal use"" So thanks for that...my expensive leftovers of late dinner I couldn't finish went to waste. And so did the next night's because I had nowhere to store the food.  Not sure what was in the hotel making my friend sneeze so much but could have been the scent piping through the lobby coming in. She was fine in other places we went.  Slots didn't pay out. Lost my $100 I brought didn't win beans on anything. Definitely wasn't putting more into it after that. Lost my leftovers lack of room upgrade just added insult to injury monetarily. I expect things in Vegas to be overpriced...definitely did not disappoint there but come on...really... not letting us store food? Can't even offset the cost a *little teeny bit*... rude.  I can't speak for sleep quality because I was so tired from the flight delays and such that I could have slept on the floor and been ok but my friend got woken up at 3 am by a VERY over-exaggeratedly loud couple going at for an hour it in the room across the hall.  Pool is nice aesthetics were nice customer service was generally friendly but I will look for other options next trip."
40,After several cancelled trips last year and this year because of Covid we finally got back to Las Vegas. We decided to go to a MGM resort this time as previously the Flamingo was our Casino of choice. Mostly because of location. We have stayed at several Casinos over the years and have noticed the changes that have taken place. As Canadians we are very aware of the cost of things as we pay approximately 30% more for everything. Costs have definitely gone up on most things. The Mirage was affordable for us but only because of the offers we got off our rewards card. MGM Resorts are typically more expensive but this time with the discounts we received from the rewards card it mad the cost difference between Flamingo & Mirage negligible which helped our decision to stay there. We look forward to going back again.
50,Excellent location have stayed there several times always impress with the decor staff go beyond for you The Beatles Show is a must !  Check- in was fast truly enjoyed the pool The Secret garden is a must.
30,The rooms were clean but outdated. The bathroom Shower was broken  Very friendly and knowledgeable staff  Pool overcrowded vary difficult to find chairs. Premium chairs unreasonably expensive (200$ a day!)
50,My daughter and I stayed at the Mirage for 4 nights 3 days. The pool was amazing and the service was incredible in all areas. Restaurants were all great. We really will miss the Mirage. Truly enjoyed our stay. Not sure where we will stay now.
20,Rooms are getting very dated and lack basic upkeep and maintenance. The tub grout was missing in several areas and the caulking was peeling. Paint on doors and mouldings was also peeling. Has gone down hill since our last visit in 2019
30,The room wall is shared with the elevator and all you here is the elevator going up and going down. I do not recommend staying in this room becasue you will not be able to sleep. Also the bed tv did not work and the room smelled musky. Also though it states it’s non smoking it is not. The towels had an old smoke smell to them as well.
50,I'm a NOIR member and tend to stay at their best resorts and was shocked that The Mirage offered me my best experience at an MGM property because of teh care and consideration afforded by their VIP experience staff Nalani and Amanuel. They provided the attention and care I'd expect but often don't receive at other properties. I've stayed more in the past year than most will stay in their lifetime and this trip to Mirage was my best experience. I just stayed at Bellagio Aria and Delano. Heading to Nomad Labor Day weekend. So when I say I was shocked it's for real. I'm also disappointed that this was my first visit to Mirage and I hadn't tried them before now. I'll definitely be staying here again in 2022.
50,We love going to the Mirage wonderful staff. My kids love the pool and spend a lot of time there. The atmosphere at the Mirage is chill and not crazy busy. Staff at the restaurants inside the Mirage are exceptional the food is delicious.
50,A very nice getaway!! We had an easy online check in staff was friendly and efficient rooms were clean comfy mattress 👍. The pool was a bit cold but it was a cloudy/ rainy day anyway😞. Definitely planning a future return👍👍
50,You walk in here & it's different. An oasis so beautiful w/many food options and a plethora of gaming choices. The pool is still amazing. Lots of shade and lots of FREE chairs surrounding the pool. Our room was clean & well kept. It's definitely showing a little wear but everything worked fine. It's our new favorite hotel in LV.
40,The staff was very friendly And the hotel was in close proximity to many other locations The pool was freezing cold even though it was a 100ﾟ out but it was beautiful. The casino was fun to play Slots however if there were more ladies on the floor the drinks would Have come quicker. All in all a great stay at a good price point
20,the first day we went there the roof in the bath was leaking so we got new rooms and then the next morning the same thing the bath roof leaking and had a inch on water on the floor.  they mored us again but then there was a shooting in another room so we got locked out of our room for more then 2 hours. the staff was great but for one manager.
50,We stayed there many times and the people are always nice the accommodations  were good and we had a very nice time. The pool area was fun and the restaurants we  were at were enjoyable. I would definitely go back there again!
20,We brought friends here for their first Vegas experience and decided to stay at the Mirage because as this was the hotel we stayed at during our trip first trip 20 years ago. boy have things changed. although our room had obviously been remodeled it looked like it had been done by the work of amateurs. I felt like the hotel was dirty especially the hotel room areas and hallways. Although I did see them vacuuming the carpet the tile and hard surfaces seemed like they were never touched as I saw the same liquid stains on the tile floors during the four days we were there. At a luxury resort you expect excellence but our dining experience at the Italian restaurant Costa was far from it the waiter the one with the potbelly was more interested in socializing with everybody than taking our dinner order and we actually had to go track him down. The grounds outside felt dirty and grungy and the presence of people with mental health issues both on the grounds as well as on the road outside made the experience very unpleasant.
10,Casino pool dolphins tigers décor table games volcano show location atmosphere are all really nice. The only problem is the payout schedule was so terrible loosing is one thing but to burn through thousands with no payout is ridiculous. Never been to a casino with this bad of odds not worth it to stay there again
20,the room i was really was so dirty and dusty i was thinking the housekeeping doesn't clean the room in a year i comment that to the housekeeping lady and she told me they gonna send to someone to clean the room but when i return to the room ohhhhh surprise was exactly like i leave the room really a lot dust every where at the frames floors carpet vanity toilet desknight stands the price at the rooms is not to bad but really i don't recommend this hotel was my third time in Vegas and never i saw a room like this before i was in Paris hotel and palazzo and everything was good please check the rooms before the guest arrive
40,Would love to have had our room darker the curtains sucked at keeping the light out and our shower was terrible at keeping water in so our bathroom was soaked but our stay was great and the hotel was very clean.
50,Had a blast bringing my son on his first trip to Vegas and first Red Hot Chili Peppers concert. Trip started with a win as we were selected for a room upgrade to the penthouse. We enjoyed Otoro and the Secret Garden.
50,This was a girl's trip and we had fun. We mostly stayed at the Mirage but did venture to a couple other locations and to the Extreme Motown which was a blast! During the W-Sat stay I was lucky and did go home with tier credits and money from the initial $100 free play!!
10,Horrific Stay  1) someone was murdered on Fl 8 and the police locked down the hotel and no one came or went for the entire evening.  Locked in the Mirage. We missed our Cirque Show  2) Sink was clogged. Front desk woke us up to tell us they needed in because the sink was clogged next door. They never showed up and OUR sink was clogged for the rest of our stay  3) Air conditioning broke and the front desk lied to me over the phone and the tech the fixed it at a.m. told us we were lied to.
30,Difficult situation due to the shooting. We were very disturbed by the shooting. For us it was a very bad situation. We are very traumatized. Fatima was the person who helped us and we are grateful. Thank you
50,We loved The Mirage. Room was clean and the bed was comfortable. But by far the reason we would stay again is the pool. Fantastic! And you have the ability to reserve a chair not just beds & cabanas. Will miss the volcano but the Hard Rock guitar hotel will be cool.
10,"WHY is a bottle of water $19?? Why not post the prices in the room with the products? Rhetorical. The room was gross (the floor is lava! (or kooties) but bed sheets were clean and beds comfortable. We bought an upgrade to see the volcano but couldn't stand at the window to watch due to floodlights beaming in. Only 1 elevator bay there in the center of the building so be ready to walk a quarter mile from your room to the elevator. No joke. Then another quarter mile to any amenity. You'll get your steps anywhere in Vegas! It would be great if there were consolidated info and better trams between venues. Glad we got to see this place and the Beatles show before it becomes an unfortunate Hard Rock Hotel (because the world needs more of those?) The staff were mostly lovely. The garden dome offers a pleasant respite if you time it right. Thank goodness it was the ""slow"" season :-DDD"
50,A great iconic iconic theme resort with great staff. It has new owners and will be rebranded and remodel with new theme.  If new owners take care of staff like first original owner it can be a Great resort
50,The mirage has the shortest walk from room to strip. Next door to Forum Shops. Cant beat its location. Sad to hear that they sold it and getting rid of the volcano. It’s a landmark. I will try to stay one more time.
10,Tower suite does not sleep 4. Rollover beds for 40usd per day each in the middle of a SUITE is the solution offered.    I’ve been at the hotel with my family from the 3rd to 5th of August 2022 suite 28043 booked by Hotels.com.    At Hotels.com the bedroom description says “Sleeps 4”. Looking at the pictures of the bedroom (a beautiful Strip-View non-smoking suite) I imagined it had a sofa bed.    Upon arrival I realized the suite does not have place for 4 people to sleep.    I dialed zero (Guest Services) and told a person the problem. Instead offering a simple solution among many available the woman who answered the phone said “no this is not a 4 people bedroom it’s a 2 people bedroom”.    I had to explain: “it’s written at Hotels.com “sleeps 4””.    Then she said:  “PEOPLE USE TO SLEEP ON THE COUCH”.    I’ve told her the hotel is responsible for uploading this kind of information at OTA’s websites and she said “no they are not” and started discussing with me.    Instead trying to solve my problem she repeatedly offended me by using an aggressive and defiant posture and tone as it was my fault. (She said her name was DOFFNEY).    And I asked her:  “Could you please move us into to two double queen bedrooms?”    And she answered:  “Once you’ve booked through a third part you will need to go check with them”.    I’ve paid around 1600usd for 2 room-nights. A double queen bedroom is 94usd per day.    After calling Hotels.com I realized The Mirage was giving Hotels.com the same hard time I received.    Instead going to the swimming pool upset and tired I had to get down to the front desk in person.    She said: Well this is not with me you need to go to that line there and I said “maybe there is another way” and she offered to call the manager.    The manager CHARLIE after telling “my” problem by the third time asking for an “undesirable” but apparently needed down grade he said he would give me an upgrade for a double room suite.    I’ve shown him I had booked a Strip View bedroom and he said “Those pictures are merely illustrative”.    End of story I’ve had to pay for a rollover bed because the second bedroom had a king bed and my father would no sleep with my 20year old son.
40,The property is beautiful. The check in/out receptionists were so friendly and kind. The room was perfect! It was clean spacious beautiful and comfortable. We were on a 6 day vacation and this was our last stay on our trip. It was the best one out of the three places we stayed. I found myself wanting to stay longer.  There were only two things that were lacking. First there were not enough cocktail waitresses on the casino floor. It took a long time to get a drink while gambling. We ended up going to a nearby casino to get better service. Second there was a shooting while we were there. The staff would not give any information regarding safety. We didn’t know if it was safe to stay in the casino safe to go to our room etc. We found out later that the shooter had not been found until hours later. It’s unnerving to know that the hotel didn’t evacuate or lock down until they were sure everyone would be safe.  Aside from those two things we absolutely loved our stay here. I would definitely stay again.
10,Shooting with no help from anyone to get a place to spend the night. We had to pay for another hotel room and couldn’t get our personal stuff or medication. We had to figure everything out on our own. Terrible experience
50,Have stayed at Mirage several times and just like the previous stays the resort met or exceeded expectations. The resort was extremely clean and staff was very friendly and helpful. Our favorite place to stay it will be a sad day when it closes.
20,They permanently close the buffet which was the only real alternative to a $30 sandwich that is poorly made. It's unfortunate to see such a good property go downhill so fast. The casino is closed for eight hours searching for the gunman who shot two and murdered one.
50,Location rooms and casino were great!    The only drawback is the very limited dining options - California Pizza Kitchen is closed on Monday and Tuesday and the much beloved wonderful (and delicious) Cravings Buffet is permanently closed.    I’ve been going to Mirage since January 1990 so while changes are expected it’s sad to see what it’s become: a bit of a shadow of its former self.
10,We had four rooms and housekeeping did not show up for 3 days in four rooms. I kept calling every day but no one helps. Rooms were not cleaned towels were not replaced and trash was not cleared for three days. Day of check out housekeeping entered room without knocking and woke us up at 8 am. Scary experience. I told them not to come back.  They again entered room without knocking at 10 am when I was changing clothes. Worst experience ever in Las Vegas.
40,Perfectly located bang in the middle of the strip.  This was our 2nd visit and it continues to be a great value mid-range hotel.  Comfortable room comfortable bed.  Nothing flash but everything is good.  The pool and waterfalls are great.
40,The 12th floor which is designated only for Stay Well rooms is superb! The stay well room too is great! The location is perfect for outside food location and the swimming pool is really nice! Visit the secret garden as well!
50,Always love staying here. Will be sad to see it go. Love three card poker- always a blast. Great slots enjoyable food amazing staff. One of the very few casinos I ever win at. Room is as clean and service was great.
50,Rooms were clean the service from the bartenders st the sports bar was excellent. Can’t say enough about the quality of food at the 3 different places we dined. The pool was nice and clean every day we went.
30,Previous stays at the mirage were excellent however it seems as if nobody cares on the staff anymore. It wasn’t the worst stay we’ve experienced in vegas but it was far from the best! Hotel wasn’t bad service was lackluster at best. Not worth the money in my opinion.
10,Over charged me then what they said they would charge. Didn’t say why. Expect more from MGM property. Overall nothing to write home about. If someone does care I would love to discuss further. I feel everyone can do better
30,The Mirage charges you $35 for a refrigerator with very minimal usable space.    The sportsbook and ease of getting around the casino was a plus. Its not massive and easy to get lost in like many others on the strip.
50,the property is ideal as it is large in nature but small to navigate the design is out of Hawaii the shows are exceptional amazing a must see the Beatles the pool is the best on the strip the only negative to Vegas is the new minimum wage bets of 25 during the day and 50 at night does not make for friendly game but for hardcore like this hotel and many on the strip there is not much action except for the weekends and expensive to the non gamer
10,There was a shooting while I was inside of the casino.  Caused me to have major anxiety  Talked to the manager at the front desk Matthew Saunderes.  He was extremely insensitive and not helpful to our situation.  I explained to him that I am a veteran of the US Air Force and that the shooting caused me major anxiety and I didn’t feel safe staying there.  I asked if he could send us to another MGM property.  He denied it and proceeded to get security to escort me and my girlfriend off the facility just to assert his power.  I ended up going to the Conrad and talking to the manager there Shawn.  He was shocked and really disappointed that Matthew wouldn’t send us to another MGM property for free.  Me and my girlfriend needed up staying with my friend who had a room in the Conrad on a day bed.  This could have been easily resolved if Matthew Saunderes cared about his customers.
30,Room was very dusty the bathroom was not clean and the TV didn’t work. The bathtub was full of hair and the sink was dirty. Not what I expected from a Stay Well room. Other amenities were standard no complaint.
50,Great hotel service. Friendly staff. Food was good. Will go to The Mirage again. Slots could have been better. Still had fun. The pools were great and the drinks were awesome. No shows this trip but always enjoyed them in the past. We have been going here for 20 plus years.
50,Great stay pool was awesome.  Rented a cabana and I was great.  Wish table games started at $5 early in days.  Besides that fanatic  Really good location and was pretty clean.  Need to clean up outside of hotel on strip
50,The rooms were a little tired and obviously it isn't the Venetian or Bellagio but we had an excellent stay thanks to the service provided by the entire staff. Everyone we encountered was helpful and friendly.
50,The rooms were very nice and clean the casino was always clean and had a lot of different choices of games to play the restaurants were excellent we’ve come quite a few times this was the first time staying at the Maroge and I would stay there again and again it’s that nice the staff is very friendly and helpful you couldn’t ask for a better hotel than the Mirage.
50,My wife and I always enjoy our stay here. We typically comes few times a year for work. We enjoy staying at this hotel and casino since its right in circle of everything we love. Shopping dining work and fun. Staff is alway pleasant .
30,My kids loved the pool and Secret Garden awesome dolphin exhibit! Have to get to the pool when they open or else you will have no where to place your things. We were not going to pay $120 for 2 lounge chairs under an umbrella. Everything else blah definitely could have been better especially for the prices availability and service.
50,As always the Mirage is always where we stay. They have always exceeded our expectations! We are going to miss the Mirage when the sale is completed. Hope to fit in another visit before this happens. We will continue to stay in MGM properties.
50,The Mirage is one of our favorite hotels because of the location & great staff. The casino staff & hospitality staff are always friendly & helpful! Only disappointing thing was some of the food outlets are closed on certain days.
50,Room with a view and great food at the restaurants. Nice stroll past the waterfalls and into the casino on the way to the elevators. Everyone is friendly and helpful. The location is a great one along The Strip.
50,We loved every part of our five day stay. It was a great location on the strip to see that side of the strip. Our room was nice and clean. We love their pool.  The gambling was great. We weren’t big winners but enjoyed quite a bit of free play feature on their slots.  We also went to see the Beatles Love production which is always amazing. We would recommend the Mirage.
30,Very Comfortable and great location.  I was able to see the strip. Shop and gamble without even leaving the property. I will definitely be returning as long as I receive my $300 deposit. You will need a cooler for your room.
50,I have stayed at a lot of hotels on the strip and this ranks up their with my favorites. has great food selection and I love the location for getting to other casino's.  we were nervous if it would be run down from being bought by hard Rock but we were wrong. It was very clean and all the staff was very nice.
50,Super comfy beds-no issues. Very spacious rooms with all the amenities needed. Very clean rooms with plenty of long mirrors when getting dressed. Highly recommend. The restaurants inside the hotel were all very good. Staff was always friendly in all departments.
50,Everything I needed was within walking distance. It was a very restful and much needed reprieve. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was perfect. The climate control which was critical that week was excellent.
50,Had a very good time. Nice seeing everyone happy and enjoying themselves. Trying to get back to normal due Covid. We lost so many people. We are very strong country and we will get thru this. United we stand!!
50,Exceptional room service workers everywhere- and greatly appreciated. Busy and happy casino floor. Enjoyed what will probably be our last experience at Mirage. Storm warning sounded over my cell so left the floor and went up to room to watch spectacular downpour. Then back to gaming. Memorable night
40,"The Mirage was OK. Way too noisy in the lobby and public areas - get rid of the nonstop lousy music. Impossible to enjoy the pool area because of the endless ""music"". What's wrong with some peace and quiet and relaxation? Put little coffee makers in the rooms; a cup of coffee first thing in the AM is a real plus. Pricey.    It was my first visit to Las Vegas and it was lay last. Crummy place."
50,Room was great with large bathrooms. Casino is smaller but has good selection of games. All the restaurants and food is excellent. Great location on the strip and easy to get around. They also have some of the best shows in Vegas with Love and Shim Linn.
50,Decades later this hotel still continues to offer great service and value! Pool is awesome I definitely recommend reserving a chair for the full experience. And definitely eat at one of the hotel restaurants. The fitness has all the equipment and is sleek.
20,Hair everywhere not cleaned room and no exchange or new room after complaining. They sent engineer to remove clog. Not so clean rooms. Felt like molds . Also you can hear all voices from corridor and outside. Not sound proof
40,We've been staying at the Mirage for years. Location is very convenient - middle of strip so you have easy access to other hotels on the Strip if you want a change of casino scenery. Rooms are a little dated now but clean and comfortable. Staff is friendly and casino is clean!
50,Honestly the best part for me was the pool. I had a very nice waitress who was fast and great at waiting on people with a smile. The only issue I had was with the salon those ladies could use a class in customer service.
50,Beautiful place to stay nice and clean . They have shopping stores inside the hotel nice restaurants. There is also a Starbucks inside . Walking distance around everything . We also enjoyed the pool is very nice !
50,Love the Mirage  clean rooms . Comfy beds .Nice staff . Check in and check out were so easy and fast. The pool area is beautiful just run out of towels early . Saw the Beatles show it was awesome  made it so easy to go right from your room to the show.
50,Property was conveniently located on the strip in close proximity to many others attractions. Rooms were sizable and very clean. Food in all restaurants we visited was excellent nice portions and great flavor great value. All employees we interacted with were very competent and housekeeping staff was exceptionally hospitable and accommodating. We came as a getaway and ended up bring an older relative who had no problem getting around the property. Overall a very nice trip and would definitely return.
40,I had a great time at the mirage. Until it was time to check out. I gave $200 security deposit. And spent $50 dollars for late check out. I didnt use anything in the mini bar or did i charge anything to the room during my stay. When it was time to check out i only received $143 of my Security Deposit back. Plus as soon as i got there they tried to charge me $9.99 for a movie that i didnt purchase. Later on they straighten that out.
50,Our hotel room was amazing and the customer service was great. We really loved our room and the view was amazing the room was very clean and I do wish we had a fridge to use but overall loved it. We had a corner room with both walls being windows. It was quite and I will definitely have to request the same room again when we are back! We enjoyed our time at the pool and jacuzzi.
50,Location is excellent pool is excellent room was very clean and over the last twenty years of staying at Mirage the rooms are always updated. First time staying there with my youngest child and he enjoyed the hotel. We previously owned in Palms Place over the last 10 years so nice to be back staying right on the strip. I do like how the gym is near the guest elevator bank. Always love the volcano!
40,Memories. Location. Staff. Restaurants. The Beatles alive. Excellent Staff ( deserves twice in billing).    Pitfall. Only a few. rooms need remodeling. Broken beds. Dusty. A/C needs refurbishing. Did more rooms upon arrival.
50,When in Vegas we tend to stay at The Mirage due to its central location on the strip. We have always had excellent experiences & this time was not the exception. Had an overall wonderful time. The volcano view rooms have a beautiful view of the strip. Love the friendly courteous attentive staff. Keep up the outstanding customer service.
50,We enjoyed every aspect of our stay the staff was awesome bartenders were fun & friendly dining experiences were great as well. We enjoyed the pool dolphin shows and the lion and tigers were great
50,The hotel and casino were beautiful and clean. The dog park is big and perfect. We had a great time … the staff were amazing and the food was excellent. Wish we could have stayed longer. We will definitely be back.
50,The Mirage is our favorite hotel on the strip! Clean plenty of food options amazing staff and a good varietyof slots. We hate that it won't be an MGM stop for much longer. We will miss it tremendously!
50,Great place to stay. Every square inch of the hotel was awesome. Clean friendly and professional staff. I would stay there again. We enjoyed the live music the pool area the VOLCANO and the casino!
50,Great stay! Love this place hate that The Mirage is going away. Very clean still has nostalgic feel but rooms are nice enough to not feel dated. Best location on the strip great pool scenes especially Bare.
50,The Mirage is one of the iconic properties in Las Vegas. Although it's over 30 years old it's aged well and is a great place to stay. My room wasn't in mint condition but it was clean and had one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept in.    The resort itself is beautiful without being gaudy and classy without being pretentious. The center Strip location is perfect and unlike many of the other resorts the parking garage wasn't super far from the hotel lobby.    Rates are fairly reasonable for Vegas and overall it's an excellent resort on the Strip!
50,Had a great time at the resort. We went to the Love Show had dinner at your heritage steak house and cocktails in a few of the lounges. Our room was clean with a nice view. We’re looking forward to returning!
50,I love staying at the mirage. It is in an excellent location for what my husband and I like to do . The lobby bar is one of my favorites it is a great place to people watch. The staff is very friendly and accommodating.
50,I have always loved the Mirage!! The Polynesian decor is beautiful. The Mirage is always clean and smells better than any other casino/hotel. I just love the iconic Volcano‼️ I've stayed there many times through the years.
50,Great summer visit. Breakfast was great at at.Beatles Show was awesome. Casino clean and hitting. Great summer visit. Breakfast was great at Pantry..Beatles Show was awesome. Casino clean and hitting.
50,Nice and clean staff was very helpful and attentive. Check in check out was super simple. Check out the volcano and the huge pretty aquarium full of beautiful fish super cool. Overall our stay was GREAT!🌋
50,Everything was good. Hotel is nice Casino Restaurants Staff Shops Entertainment and Amenities were all great. We really enjoyed seeing the Volcano while staying there which was right outside our window.
50,Love the pool! We had a great time. Very clean! A convenient location.. next to many different restaurants and casinos. We already have reservations for Labor Day weekend. Danny Ana Shelly were very helpful!
50,I LOVE The Mirage! Great shows! Great bartenders that really know their stuff! Friendly staff! Great location in the center of the Vegas Strip! The food is awesome. Don’t miss The Beatles Love! My favorite place on earth!
40,I thought the hotel was very clean the staff was very helpful the restaurants are very good the gambling was fair payoffs were not very very much but good enough the room was nice the air conditioner worked very well it was 113 114° over there and everything turned out OK I will definitely go to Maroge hotel again
50,My Hubby and I had been traveling for work a lot this summer and decided on we should just stay in Las Vegas for a few days between business trips. What a Great time we had and how Lucky we were to stay at the Mirage. Everything was Great even better then we had expected! Thank you to everyone that works there.
50,Room was clean and updated. Maid did a great job each day. Pool was awesome with the cabana rental. Had a person checking on us making sure everything was good. Dinner at steak has was very good also just make a reservation
10,Terrible expérience. The room was tiny outdated. So is the hotel itself. No view whatsoever. No amenities. There is much much better at this kind of price like the Venetian or palazzo which is just accross the road.
50,Our 1st trip to Las Vegas together was awesome. My husband and I took a quick get away and we were relaxed. The casino was lively; food was a tad expensive but we expected that. We played slots and learned a lot about Blackjack! It was hot hot and the pool provided a nice respite. Great property. We loved having parking privileges at other MGM properties too.
20,AC was not working properly. I had to make multiple calls. The AC was finally fixed on my last day. I was given multiple excuses. I was not offered a different room. Housekeeping left the door to my room open on one occasion
50,Loved everything. Hate to see it being closed in the near future. The Mirage is indeed an iconic Resort Casino on the Strip. Will be missed a lot~~ I extended my trip to Vegas one more day just to be able to stay at least one night for the last time b4 it closes... and it was perfect. It has everything you expect from a casino hotel on the Strip.
40,I hope you're not on vacation to get away from the kids cuz this a water park with a small zoo attached. Casino floor isn't what it used to be. Empty and dark. Restaurants and shops close early and there isn't any great value or dining deals inside. You'll have to travel for that in the Old Strip.
50,Ive been to Vegas 38 times and have stayed in just about every hotel on the south end of the strip (I started a list 20 years ago). There are great hotels and miserable ones but the one I keep returning to is the Mirage. Fantastic location good restaurants best pool on the strip friendly staff plenty of table games and slots and friendly staff. Their Stay-well rooms are some of the best (and cleanest) in town and the A/C actually works well. Very sad its being sold off to Hard Rock.
50,My sisters and I traveled out west this summer and started our trip in Las Vegas. We couldn’t have picked a better hotel for our first night of our vacation. The Mirage was beautiful the service was great we were even allowed to check in early! A very nice selection of restaurants and all the food we ate was excellent. A beautiful pool to cool off in the 110+degree temperatures. And the show we saw there in the hotel was outstanding! Don’t miss it The Beatles Love - Cirque du Soleil.
40,Great place only thing gave lower score was they only cleaned our room 3 days we were there. Had to talk to two different people to finally get someone. But still a nice place to stay at. Ashamed they are demolishing it
50,We stayed here last weekend for a friend's 21st birthday and immediately felt the love across the entire property! Everyone was helpful upon check in and made us feel welcome at their resort. We also became proud rewards members! The two pit bosses who signed us up for the MGM Rewards Card were great salesmen and also very kind to us. They even gave my friend a free jacket to make him feel special on his birthday weekend. Their names were Todd and Elena; they definitely deserve some recognition! On top of that John from Staten Island in table games was a phenomenal dealer and was genuinely interested in us as people. One of my favorite dealers I've ever had. These three employees really made our stay for us but so did the entire team you have over there! I will be coming back soon.
20,The rooms are dated smelled of smoke the tub was dirty and the shower would not drain. Our resort fee was refunded and we were able to change rooms but only because we requested it. Our new room had the same standing water issue in the shower. It was gross!
10,This place has gotten so bad since our last stay. Homeless people in the property. No working amenities. Restaurants were mostly closed. And staff just didn’t care. We paid for 4 nights but stayed 1. They refused to process a partial refund. We refused to stay so ended up at the Conrad down the strip. Cleaner. Brand new. Friendlier. Great service.
50,Loved the Mirage its beautiful and convenient.  Room was large enough for what we needed. Stay away from all the snacks that are by the refrig. Very expensive. You can easily cross the street and get water instead of paying $$$ for water in your room.
50,Beautiful friendly resort. Wish the restaurants were open a bit later. Clean rooms. The staff at the front were very attentive and wanting to assist. We were able to get a fridge brought to our room which was nice.
50,Fabulous hotel. Absolutely gutted it’s closing. Lovely big rooms clean and staff are lovely! Pool is really big there are plenty of beds. However (I think it was more the time of year we visited) you have to queue for the pool/beds. People want the front seats or the shaded ones so go quite early. Pool opens at 8 it might not be as bad out of season. If this hotel was not closing the only thing I was suggest they needed to do was renovate the bathrooms. It was still a bath with a shower overhead and a shower curtain. Cubicles look much better. Also the toilet was too close to the door. But overall a wonderful stay!
30,The hotel itself was beautiful unfortunately my room bathroom tub would NOT drain properly. Reported several times they sent a engineer to fix the problem. It was never properly fixed. Had to bath in dirty standing water was never offered to move rooms. Was never offered any other solution and was not compensated in anyway for the discomfort.
30,I was disappointed in the stay well room. False advertising. It did not have the mood lighting for room. None of them have it anymore.  No coffee pots in rooms. You can't get from housekeeping either.  Beds nice...pillows awesome.  Spa was fantastic. Lacks communication for Tournament. It stressed me out no one knew nothing till morning of only one day Tournament when we were told two days.
10,The room was in no condition to be occupied by a guest. Rain water poured in around the exterior wall not directly from the window itself. I've never seen anything like it. It also stank of cigarettes which we did attempt to air out (before the rain) but the window wouldn't stay open.  The location of the hotel is great and we like the amenities of the property and the Volcano show is awesome but with room conditions like that I don't know that I would ever return.
50,Our favorite place to stay in Vegas. Great location on the strip. Close to everything. Very beautiful and clean. Staff is very nice and welcoming. So sorry it is going to change to the Hard Rock. That is a shame.
50,Beautiful hotel nice location and beautiful swimming pool and great staff and plenty of different types of restaurants all day long and we enjoyed the dolphin at the secret garden in a nice green nature
50,Walk in and the lobby is breath taking and great for pictures the hotel was clean with lots of options for dining and gaming. Our room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  Only issue we came across- Room could use a bit of an update and the lights from the pool shine directly into the room windows and light up the room at night even with curtains closed.  All staff was friendly and helpful the Pantry was absolutely delicious and the wait was quick for us to sit down. Location is fantastic with easy access to the strip and other casinos and food close by. Pool was huge with lots of places to sit and a great vibe. I was surprised at the hotel being as nice as it was for a rather cheap price compared to others near by. Definitely would recommend and will be returning in the future.
50,Love the location and Polynesian feel of the Mirage. Easy access to the Strip but plenty to do at the Mirage. We got a volcano view room volcano only goes off a handful of times and the show is like 2 minutes. Skip that view and go for the strip view. Otherwise loved the room!  Cocolini was our favorite indulgence you must try! We loved the pool and the overall friendliness of the staff. Slot machines weren’t too friendly to us but that’s luck.
30,We have stayed at the Mirage quite a few times over the years. This last stay will be our last at the Mirage. It seems as though they (management) do not care about the property any longer. Casino was dark and dingy. Room was not up to par. With all of the competition on the Strip we will choose a different property to stay with on our next trip.
10,Cleanliness. We had 2 queen beds and we couldn’t sleep in one of them because the sheets were dirty. They was makeup on the comforter and a brush stain in the sheets. bed was obviously made but linens were not changed GROSS! Room service came in a bag with no table to eat on. Pasta sauce spilled all over the bag. Could hear people outside of our room at all hours.
50,I definitely recommend Mirage hotel casino very clean no noise on the hallways and I was able to rest .hotel kid friendly what I really love about the casino it that it has a lot of restaurants where you can go and eat
50,The Mirage is a great place to stay. It is very convenient to all parts of the strip. Very close to many different casinos and restaurants. The staff were very friendly and nice. The pool was awesome! I enjoyed the food at the Paradise restaurant by the pool. The room was clean and had a fanatic view of the volcano!
50,Every time I stay here I never have any problems the staff treat me very well And I enjoy the hotel visits 😊 r ooms are clean and pleasant the food is good and the wait is not long for a table overall a good experience
50,Looking forward to coming back. I would like to see some no smoking table games. The ventilation is good unless a smoker sits at your table. The pool and cabana were excellent and Danielle was fabulous.
20,Refused to remove the illegal resort fees without being a higher type of member. Brought it to the front staff and yet they told me no. I mentioned this illegal practice but was told too bad...Rude staff.
50,Staff was very friendly and professional. Room was very clean and beds were super comfortable. Such a Great experience very thankful for that. Slot machines can probably be a little looser and give out little money lol. Casino staff was really attentive and friendly.
10,Baby milk is considered medical at all other properties except Mirage apparently. They will argue with you for a 35/day fee when you come to Vegas almost monthly and never have to pay to store your baby's milk in the fridge!
50,Mobile/key less checkin & lock. No need to stand in lines. Clean and fun to hang out in. Amazing show outside snd we saw the Beatles Cirque De Soleil! Amazing! I would love to come back. I do long trips so it’s a little pricey for that. But for short stays it’s perfect.
50,The mirage is a fantastic place to stay in Vegas! It is clean and beautiful and the staff are all so friendly. It is in a great central location to walk to different places! There are also some great restaurants in the Mirage as well!
50,For this being our first time to Vegas we were not sure for central location hotel. THIS IS IT! For couples or even families the Mirage is a gorgeous hotel with so many things to offer. Perfect location central strip. The staff throughout our whole stay was absolutely amazing honestly we were so amazed with how kind and helpful every single staff member was!
20,I understand that The Mirage is affordable that it is located in an ideal location that it is an old building. However it would be nice to see the rooms be innovated. Toilet bowl is too low the walls need a makeover the carpet is getting old. Can't renovate without raising prices? Okay well then make sure the room is 100% clean before renting it out. By that I mean make sure bathroom trash can is clean tile floor is clean bedsheet(s) are stainless etc.
40,Still a nice strip hotel although becoming dated. Not sure how the transition to a Hard Rock hotel will affect customer experience. Rooms need updating especially the toilet seats as they are extremely low at least in my room 10093. Looking forward to visiting again after rebranding as hotel is in perfect spot to enjoy Strip.
30,This hotel could use a serious update. The rooms were clean but the bathroom was outdated. Nice fluffy big towels. The sink wasn't draining properly. The maid service was good and the front desk also. Their restaurants were pretty pricey. That being said I believe that the Mirage was recently bought out by Planet Hollywood and is going to be demolished and replaced by one of the huge guitar hotels.
50,One of the best places to stay on the strip. Clean Rooms Friendly and helpful staff excellent restaurants. Great location with easy access to the strip and other hotels and restaurants. I highly recommend this hotel.
50,Very friendly staff  Great location  The food in restaurants is very tasty and also the waiters are very friendly. Staff at the front desk very patient and friendly and also the price very affordable definitely i would recommend.
40,The staff everywhere I visited within The Mirage were all very helpful. However there wasn't a lot of storage or counter space in the bathrooms and I feel like the rooms needed some updating. Sad to hear that this is the last year but looking forward to the new Hard Rock!
50,Enjoyed several great days at the Mirage! They have all the gambling options you could want. Mirage is decorated using a fun tropical south pacific theme.The seat-yourself restaurant Snacks (least expensive but not inexpensive) serves good food prepared quickly. They also have a short volcano show at the top of the hour 8pm-11pm.  All told I'm not sure why the owners would want to re-imagine the Mirage?!
50,The Mirage was a very beautiful place and I’m so happy that I could stay there for the 2 nights I was in town. Great customer service everyone was so nice to me and my guest. Had a great stay and can’t wait to come back!!
50,Just like the other MGM properties we have stayed at The Mirage is a first class operation. Guest rooms are very nice and clean. All the restuarants have excellent food and a full menu to choose from. The casino is clean and well laid out. All the employees we dealt with were very polite and helpful.
50,The Mirage is an amazing property in a central strip location. The tropical lush vibe is a welcome oasis in the concrete neon overdone properties on the Strip. The wide variety of restaurants is unparalleled.
40,Enjoyed the resort overall as far as options for eateries drinks entertainment the pool. Location on strip is good. Parking is easy enough and not a far walk although I think paying for parking in a hotel on top of the resort fees is a slap in the face to customers. Check in was easy. My room floors were dirty from lint/paper trash and one of the pillows smelled like cologne so that's the reason for the cleanliness score.
40,Mirage is our go to for the combination of affordability location and the pool. It’s definitely not high end but it is all around a good choice. It’s clean friendly and has all of the amenities needed for a basic Vegas stay.
50,We enjoyed the accommodations at the property. Loosen up the machines a bit. Toilet seat loose rugs could have been cleaner...gentleman at desk for both check in and check out was very courteous and professional
50,We’ve stayed at the Paris and Excalibur and this was our favorite so far. We checked in early around 10 am after arriving and wasn’t charged extra for early check in. We were charged at Paris. They do put a $400 hold on the card you use at check in but refund you when you leave. The room was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. We never had to ask for housekeeping services they were great and friendly. We’ve always had to ask at the other hotels. Eat at the Heritage steakhouse! We’ve eaten at SW Steakhouse and Top of the World which are both pricey and the ribeye at the Heritage was the best we’ve eaten! We didn’t have a bad meal at any of the restaurants. The car rental company (Avis) in the hotel was double what enterprise wanted to charge. We shopped around and Enterprise in the Linq was $100 a day instead of $200! Also I recommend reserving your car. Avis told us we didn’t need to reserve a car and there would be plenty well there was none that next morning. Had to rearrange our plans and decided to shop around. The location was perfect for us and we will hate to see the change to Hard Rock but hopefully the important things will stay the same.
20,This place is set up to separate you from every penny to your name. I am of course not just talking about the casino everyone knows that’s happening. Its all the other things from the rooms to the vending machines with no prices. Hey those snacks and waters in the room DONT PICK THEM UP! You are automatically charged over $15 for a water insane. Move onto the mini fridge of course everything in there is crazy expensive too but heres the kicker. If you put anything in the fridge in your room its a $50 charge. WTF? So you go the vending machine in the hall guess what no prices on anything who knows what that water costs you just have to find out after you pay whatever they decide. The convenience store in the lobby same game no prices find out as you get rung up. This place and MGM try to convince you this us all for your relaxation when in my opinion the reality is they are separating hard working people from their hard earned dollars in a predatory fashion. I’ll be taking my business elsewhere.
20,Came into our room had a dirty rag that was left mirror still had mascara on it and the room had a weird smell to it. Pictures online make it look wayyy nicer then what you get. Room is older looking and ran down.
50,Room was excellent ! Employees were friendly and helpful . Affordable prices compared to some others on the strip. Everything was clean. Mirage is conveniently located in the middle of the strip. I don't have a single complaint
50,The Mirage was surprisingly a great place to stay. It was my first time and I really enjoyed it there. All staff throughout the hotel and casino were extremely friendly the room was clean and comfortable and the pool was beautiful. Looking forward to staying there again.
30,Sadly this property has seen better days but it still shines just not as brightly as it used to do. Perhaps it has something to do with the selling to Hard Rock I don't know. Still a good value but it used to be so much better. Many families with children running around and hanging out by the slot machines and tables. If you are looking for a more adult fun place without the underage children look to other MGM properties. Plus side...food options are good location is good and staff is friendly.
50,Our room and casino in general were clean and well maintain. Staff service was excellent. The casino has different kind of restaurants. We got to enjoyed the food of some of them.. My kids enjoyed the pools and the dolphin show. We will definitely come back again.
50,Great location great pool nice layout. Close to forum shoppes in Caesars Palace. Great location on the strip at an affordable price.    Only complaint is that there was no late night dining options. Everything was closed by 10-1030pm and only the 24/7 “snacks” eatery was open during a busy week in July.
50,The property is well kept and the staff are very friendly and always helpful. Room was clean which is very important. The volcano show out front is a must see. The Beatles Love cirque du soleil show was awesome. Overall a great experience being a guest at The Mirage.
20,I would not stay here again every morning housekeeping would use their key to come into our room even though I had privacy sign the last morning they did it twice I even called front desk and they did it a third time !!    My Uber driver left my phone with front desk (I was on phone with him as he gave it to them and I was told to bring ID) I went straight down stairs and was told numerous times they didn’t have it and they sent me on wild goose chase looking for it I then came ba k and said to ask every employee at front desk they came back again saying they didn’t have it I then said check your cameras cause your employee stole my phone it magically appears with my Apple Pay open !! Shady employees
30,Had a massive problem at Caesar’s and they were very nice to us after a last minute booking. I assumed we got a free upgrade to find out we didn’t but that was rectified right away after speaking to the front desk. Was traveling with someone who had a broken leg they were accommodating unlike Caesar’s who told us to walk across to Harahs after a problem with our room and we could walk Back for the pool. (Broken leg = no waking) Customer service was great and all staff were fantastic that we came in contact with. Was pleasantly surprised.    Room was okay. Beds too soft as well as the pillows and after a big rain the floor was soaking wet. I was too tired to complain and truly defeated on this trip but did call after returning home the next day. Carpet dirty and dated now.    Our room seemed to only have hot water in the taps in the sinks. Turned them on and brushed fast.    Casino was okay. Considering my trip started and finished on a terrible note and was looking for more luxury after a 2.5 year delay in Vegas vacations it was good for a mid range hotel.
20,Stayed 4 nights here after a 3 year break from Vegas and I was stunned at the difference from all previous stays - and I've visited and stayed at the Bellagio dozens of times over the years. The hotel felt dirty and over run. The King suite I booked had broken handles stained furniture the shower handle was broken and the door allowed water to leak and flow all over the bathroom floor. Housekeeping only cleaned the suite twice during our 4 night stay. Despite paying over $800 per night for the suite we occupied we were told we'd have to wait longer for our room service meals if we wanted them on actual china - otherwise they'd be happy to send everything up right away in paper bags and plastic utensils. This is no longer a 5 star star resort. There is nothing refined or luxurious about this property except the steep prices.
50,This place was amazing. I’m really hoping it’s still there next year. We plan on going again for our anniversary. We’re going to make it a yearly trip. Not entirely sure when the transition will be for the hard rock but let’s hope it isn’t anytime soon!
50,Beautiful hotel and casino. I enjoyed my stay here. Sorry to here that the Mirage is being sold to Planet Hollywood. I enjoyed the variety of slot machines available. I also appreciate the signage directing guests.
40,I was literally at the opening of the Mirage over 30? years ago. It was a very classy addition to the Strip. I was sad when I stayed there this month to hear that it is going to be totally demolished and Hard Rock is going to replace it.    While of course many larger and fancier hotels have been built since. I thought the Mirage remained a nice place to stay. The rooms while dated are still roomy its location on the Strip is great and the staff was very friendly. Some complained about how old everything is; but of course if the plans have been to demolish it you are not going to be updating it. I enjoyed it: the access to the hall of stores the hotel restaurants the convention area was spacious and I loved the comedy show (Daniel Tosh) I saw there.
50,We always have an amazing time at the Mirage! Staff is friendly and inviting. Rooms are nicely appointed and clean. The main pool is beautiful and well maintained. Shopping in Paradiso is always a highlight. Stay here and visit Gary at the tables he will make your gambling experience fun win or lose!
40,Mirage is a nice hotel we stayed in a suite but it was a little dated. Over all great size. Good restaurants to choose from and other great amenities. Will come back here again likely. Clerk at the front desk did state the loyalty program doesn’t really do much in regards to reoccurring stays which is kind of disappointing for return costumers
30,Rooms need upgraded. Dirty bathrooms. Pipes constantly made gargle sounds. View provided was terrible. Snacks was great place to eat. Roasted Bean was convenient and good service. Check in was easy. Check out was confusing by not applying promotional credits so I had to stand in line to ask questions.
50,I highly recommend the Mirage for couples or family trips. Awesome food options on property and great central location on the strip. We enjoyed our time at the pool and saw two shows. The dealers are so nice. There’s a lot of late night action too!
30,Everything was fine however it's obvious the resort is becoming dated and needs a deep clean. The layout casino and attractions were great. Staff rushed us through check-in. No chance to hear about upgrades.
50,Excellent hotel. Clean and friendly. Everything was in good working order. The only issue I had was with the on-line check-out to save waiting in line. I never received a copy of my bill. That should be automatically emailed to me.
10,Terrible service at this hotel I was giving a handicap accessible room I’m not handicap I offered to give the room back just in case it was need for a handicap and they told me no rooms were available. Then when I use the shower the bathroom kept flooding they never fixed it just gave me towels to put on the floor
50,"We came back to the Mirage after many years taking a ""spur of the moment"" three-day trip. The property is the most beautifully landscaped on the strip - especially the atrium and the pool area. Reasonably priced with very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms were very comfortable and there are plenty of good restaurants and bars on the property."
30,Nice hotel rooms nice casino and nice pool. I had a bad time waiting 3.5 hrs for a room when I had requested an early check in. No apologies for the what I Deemed Call And excessive wait time for a room booked in advance at vets
50,We have been staying at Mirage for years. The property is still in decent shape given Hard Rock will be doing a remodel. We love the central strip location and the pool. Pantry and pool food were good
30,Wish there were more hand sanitizer stations cleaning wipes etc. in the casino. Lots of dirty ashtrays and questionable stains. The service beds and rooms were nice. The food was good and ordering Starbucks in advance was convenient.
10,I have always booked thru mlife and my confirmation included a 15 free play a 50 food credit and up to 3 comp nights. When I checked out I received no comp nights. They said the dates I picked were blocked. That’s not true. I have booked many es before and if you picked a blocked night they let you know before you book it. Very misleading. Not surprised the mirage has been bought out. Maybe that’s why the answer to everything is NO.
50,the stay was super good very nice rooms nice staff and great hospitality. my family loved staying here. close to all hotels and kid friendly. great food as well.they have a great pool and secret garden. plus i love the beatles!!!!
10,they downgrade my room and didnt adjust the price. i called for towels twice and never got them. staff on casino floor was rude and screamed at my kids to stay off the casino floor when they were walking towards the restroom on the walkway not on the casino floor.he was rude even after i explain to him
50,My husband and I try to get to Vegas at least once a year. We wanted to take our family...7 total...to see what we enjoy. After a two year pandemic delay we FINALLY got to experience the Mirage with family and show them what we love about it! Everything :) Willie Haddock always treats us like family and we get five star treatment. The property is spotless and the entire staff strives to please. We encountered an issue when one member of our family came down with poison ivy rash and wanted her own bed. Brian in the VIP Lounge got right on it and in minutes she had a room at a very fair casino rate and she was so appreciative! Brian realized the situation and was so caring and kind hearted realizing you gly 2000 miles for vacation and are miserable with poison...ugh! Also Sheila in the VIP Lounge helped me soooo many times I can't tell you. She just got the job done with whatever you gave her. Everyone from housekeeping to security does an outstanding job and HOPEFULLY things will not change with new ownership management or whatever plans they have for the Mirage. You honestly don't need to leave the property. The family just love love loved the pool. Wow it's just an amazing layout. The dolphins and tigers were a hit with a family member too. Miss the place already! You just cannot miss when you stay at the Mirage ever!
50,Mirage never disappoints  will be missed when it changes to Hardrock love staying at this hotel great pool rooms and location. Front desk is always great when checking in and hotel has kept up nicely over the years
50,I always enjoy my time there whatever you need you get it right away from guest services never have any problems I truly enjoy my time there. I’m going back up there again this weekend and that’s where I’m staying I don’t stay anywhere else.
50,Me and my husband celebrated our 10 year wedding anniversary at this property. We were so fortunate to be able to experience this property for the first time before hard rock destroys it. We found much positivity staying here. Staff were so friendly and helpful and really knew what you wanted before you even wanted it. The rooms were clean and the bed was so comfy you don’t want to leave!! Most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept in out of all the Vegas hotels I’ve stayed in.  We had the tower king strip/ volcano view so that was a real treat! The room was super clean lots of places to put your clothes including your own separate closet and double sinks. The staff at the pool had excellent customer service. The pool is one of the most beautiful pools in Vegas with waterfalls and plenty of free chairs all around the pool So we never had issues finding a spot. There is shade in some areas but you just have to look for them. We’d definitely stay here again!
40,We've always wanted to stay at the Mirage! We had a brief but memorable stay eating good food enjoying the pool area having a fun time gambling and relaxing. Everyone who worked there was nice and welcoming. The room we stayed in could use a little updating but considering that it was a pet-friendly room I kind of expected that. We'll be sad to see The Mirage turned into The Hard Rock:( It has always been a unique hotel in Vegas so it's a bummer to hear that it's going away. Stay there while you can!
50,After the many many many reviews of hotels I went with The Mirage and it didn’t disappoint! The mobile app check was so easy and convenient. No waiting in line to check in! I stayed in the Stay Well room which offers more air purification. The room was clean and fresh. Zero complaints about the room. Also the hotel is centrally located! I would definitely stay here again!!
40,This hotel has been around for a long time but I was pleasantly surprised at how nice and well kept it is. I also received very good customer service through the in room dining. Each person I encountered was pleasant and helpful. The room was cleaner than I expected as well.
50,the hotel is very nice and clean and taken care of... just make sure when you check out call the day before because they seem to get back logged for over 40 minutes with is not acceptable. the volcano is beautiful and so are the grounds as is the secret garden
50,Amazing facilities and service! Front desk staff went out of their way to accommodate a special room request. The facilities are always kept exceptionally clean. All of the staff understand the importance of good customer service. Very much enjoyed the dolphin/tiger habitat and the pools.
40,This is an excellent hotel with a nice pool. Love the security measures taken by the hotel. The concierge service provided details of attractions we may like. Housekeeping ensure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay
50,I love the mirage. The staff there are so amazing kind and just the best. Everyone there were polite. I always get a suite and they are BOMB. The VIP SERVICES ARE EVERYTHING. They make you feel special
50,First time in Vegas. Hotel wasn’t too much. Easy to navigate. Walked through Caesars/Bellagio/Wynn and those were just way too big (for me). Central in the strip. Great restaurants great pool. Rooms are a bit dated but comfy bed. Had a couple nights where people were loud in the hall but not hotel’s fault. All staff were stellar!
50,My family and I enjoyed our stay at The Mirage. It has a beautiful lobby plant oasis and pool! Our room on floor 12 was very nice. Great room and hotel location for the price. We will stay here from now on! 😀👍
40,Clean comfortable hotel close to many attractions on the Vegas Strip. Pool was great (especially with the hot weather in July) Many restaurant options available on site. Great hotel centrally located!
50,Nice hotel with friendly and knowledgeable staff. We dined at COSTA Italian restaurant which had excellent food. Don’t forget to get your desserts at Cocolini Gelato which has amazing gelatos and pastries and they are open late.
30,1 of the 2 rooms was dirty.  Bathroom had makeup and hair all over the sink and counter and hair in the bathtub.  One of the bed of the sheets and pillow cases still had makeup on them so the sheets were dirty.
50,Great hotel however long lines at the check in center besides that Great casino and dolphin show is a must. Just like any other hotel it will be busy. The essential store had everything I needed even at 5am and the snacks cafe had amazing food!
50,The Mirage provided me with a great room! Very clean and everything function as it should. Modern amenities like usb charging ports and and HDMI input for the tv. Bathroom was modern and worked as it should. The hotel is also not far from the main part of the Vegas strip and easily accessible to uber cars. Other hotels have really strange pick up spots but not Mirage. The casino also has good restaurants and plenty of options to grab snacks.
50,The staff are friendly able to help at all levels. the rooms are clean and the beds are very comfortable. Able o get a good night sleep high is normally difficult for me at a hotel. Right where u need to be along the strip.
40,Really good location hotel services and staff. Only thing missing to get those 5 stars would be to have a microwave fridge and coffee maker in room. Things can get pricey so to have the ability to get a few supplies and have them ready in the room during the stay would go a long way.
50,Every employee i encountered during my stay was extremely friendly and helpful. After visiting other Casino I had to say this was the best. The room was cleaned daily the housekeeping staff was friendly. The restaurant staff were very friendly. I enjoyed conversing with the bar tenders while playing poker. Everyone just made sure to check on us frequently to make sure we had everything we needed.
20,Flies through the bathroom vent. Room located on second floor and even if you killed them they still kept on coming. Very difficult to get someone available to address this issue. Will not be staying at the mirage again.
50,Just back from our second stay at The Mirage and it won't be our last! We love everything about it...it's just the right size - it doesn't take forever to talk from one end to the other. The pool is amazing and we really enjoyed eating poolside at the cafe each day (chicken tacos - yum!) and the location is tough to beat...it's central to the Strip. All in all it's the perfect package and we can't wait to go back!
40,Haven’t been to Vegas in 3 years (ugh Covid) but our stay here is always comfortable. Check in and out are beyond easy. Had a nice view of the strip and pool. The pool is always clean and we love the waterfall.
50,First time staying at the Mirage and it was exceptional. There were some minor issues checking in but the hotel went out of its way to ensure that everything was fixed. Our new preferred hotel on strip
10,Rooms are really old! Our TV didn’t work needs to be updated. Close to everything I must say. We do like the pool area and restaurant are good. If you don’t care about room quality this is a perfect place. I’m way too bougie and like nice stuff.
40,The Oasis private pool was excellent. Rooms looking a little tired. Non-functioning safe missing phone cord. housekeeping failed to address either issue .Good sports book. Good entertainment options. Great location on the center strip.
40,We picked this hotel for the great pool and location on the Strip. The pool was wonderful. Even though we didn't show up early or rent a chair/cabana we were able to find lounge chairs in the shade. The bed was very comfortable and the room was large! There was a Starbucks very conveniently located downstairs near the guest elevators which was helpful in the morning. The only downside was that we couldn't find any quiet bar/restaurant area. Every place had the same loud music going which is fine most of the time but we went elsewhere to find a place where it was a little more relaxing.
50,We stayed for 4 days &3 nights! We enjoyed and liked our stay! Staff are friendly and approachable! I love the volcano eruption shows at night! Our room is clean too! My husband lost his cp & driver’s license while playing and went to lost and found and got them back! We will definitely come back!
10,Don't waste your time by coming to Mirage. It is not as good as it once was. CPK is the only restaurant I would recommend to dine in. You will not be satisfied with any other ones. Yes I have tried most of them.
40,I thought the hotel was good. It is located in the middle of the strip so if you are going to hotel hop this is a good place to stay. Moreover there is plenty of things to do at the hotel and several food choices. The rooms are spacious and the service at the hotel is fine.
10,Lost money doesn’t get added to your rewards no fridge no coffee machine friendly staff got no room service on one of my days which left me without clean towels or shampoo which was a bummer. Nothing complimentary offered.
10,Multiple room moves due to first room having black stains on sheets. Second room I was moved to had blood stains on the sheet. The manager tried to tell me I should be okay he doesn’t think it’s blood could be rust from their washer machines but never saw the bed and I took pics. Third room had hair on the bathroom sink tub and drawer where the hair dryer was. I had to accept that they overlook a lot when flipping the room. Even though the manager upgraded me after the blood sheets the new room was not up to par. I work as a manager at a boutique hotel and would never be so nonchalant they way they were.
10,Our room was far out on a wing. It took a while to walk all the way out there! Normally I wouldn't take a water from the mini-bar but we were just so far away from everything I didn't want to walk it all again.    They charged us eighteen dollars for the water. This displeases us.
30,Room had not been cleaned very well. Found several pills lying in the floor upon checkin in. Several used band-aids were also lying on the floor in plain site. Couldn’t use the mini fridge in the room b/c it was a stocked minibar. Called front desk to ask if we could use the fridge and was told if we moved anything in the fridge to make room for our personal stuff we would be charged for everything that was moved. She asked to get a fridge that we could actually use we were told that would be an additional charge.
50,This is the first time we got a view of the strip!! With a view of the volcano!! Totally worth it!! Hotels was awesome!! We picked it because The Beatles cirque du solei was showing there! By the way… it such an awesome show!! Absolutely loved it!! Oh yah … I did not have to wait in line for check in… checked in using their app… super fast and quick!!
30,Stayed here overnight on a road trip. The hotel is convenient off the freeway if you are traveling through Las Vegas. Our room this time was quite nice. I think paying a few dollars more (literally) for a view room made the difference. Value received for room cost I would rate as OK not great value but not bad either. I don't pay resort fees or parking fees as I have status at MGM. Had those been added to my bill I would have a different attitude.  In overall though I should say this is my default hotel in Las Vegas. It's convenient to the convention center and freeway and by Vegas standards isn't bad.
20,Booked two joining rooms. One of them the shower wouldn’t turn on or off and had to request maintenance and the other room bathroom lights didn’t turn on. Had to request maintenance a second time. All totaled it took about 4 hours in the room so feel half a day was wasted. No one bothered to check on us either to make sure the problems were resolved. I was also met with a very rude person at check in that didn’t want to talk or answer any of my questions. Being that this property has been sold to Hard Rock it felt like the staff had given up on the guests the hotel and overall guest experience. Not sure if I’ll stay at an MGM property again.
50,The Hotel the food the staff everyone was polite & professional best experience I’ve had by far & I’ve stayed at 70% of the hotels on Las Vegas strip. I would definitely recommend this stay to anyone visiting VEGAS.
40,We recently stayed at the Mirage and had a good experience. Check in was a little slow but we made it. The location was great and the entire property was pretty clean given how old it is. The only issue we had was there was dust build up on our lamps fixtures and baseboards in our room. A little extra cleaning and I would give it a rating of 5!
50,Our experience was amazing! I would definitely bring my family here and I will say the beds were comfortable. This property was located in the middle of the strip. So you definitely will not go wrong staying here. 👍🏻
30,The staff was great. The location was pretty good there is MGM mall next door with plenty of restaurants. The hotel can appear to be a little out dated but the prices on the rooms are pretty good. I would stay here again.
50,Friendly staff. We enjoyed our time room was clean and service was great Will definitely stay there again!! Family had a great time in the pool!! The best part is that it was right in the middle of the strip so made it was to get around the strip. View was amazing!!
10,The hidden fees we asked for two room side-to-side they were on complete ends of the hallway the $400 deposit at the end to make sure the room was okay was crazy staff was not friendly and very disorganized
50,Hadn't stayed there in years. Rooms especially bathroom spacious and very clean. Good array of restaurants. Stack was a disappointment. Great rooms. Check in was easy and got an upgrade. All employees very friendly.
30,Mirage is an iconic hotel and location that said way over priced limited food selections casino that is tight as a drum I felt taken advantage of at every turn. Saturday night July 16 a stampede of people running towards door screaming active shooter I ask security WTF going on? False alarm was his response???? Will never stay on strip or downtown again and I've been coming since 1981. Not a safe or fun environment anymore vagrants camped everywhere. My tip save your money or stay off strip at local casinos. Sad but is sign of times. Done
40,At the Mirage Snack restaurant we had the es Reuben Sandwich ever. I definitely recommend this restaurant while staying at the Mirage Hotel and Casino. I have stayed at this hotel many times and I certainly would recommend it.
50,Loved our stay here. Check in was quick and easy. Room was big and clean and kept clean. The breakfasts from the pantry were amazing. Casino was spotless and very well presented. Bars were great American IPA is awesome. Great location on the strip.
10,Do NOT stay in this hotel. The front desk staff is rude and poorly trained. No one in this hotel answers the phone or returns email in a timely or professional manner. The Concierge is irrelevant. The hotel (including guest rooms and corridors) smells like smoke and garlic. The bathrooms and corridors are dated. The fitness room is small dirty and has at least 7 machines out of service. The only saving grace is the steakhouse in the lobby but then again loads of salt and butter makes everything ok. For the same cost or less there are way better options in Las Vegas where the staff actually values their hotel.
10,Terrible hotel does not take proper care of their customers. Doesn’t add rewards or points to card unless you’re playing with the machines which YOU WILL NEVER WIN AT. Their machines are terrible I went with over 15 people and no one won a thing; we were playing for 4 days straight
40,The trip was very good had a lot of fun in the Mirage casino servers were very nice gambling was up and down. At the end though had to check out online since was at the pool so for reason didn’t get my $100 resort credited to my account.
50,We had the space to work and visit plus baths for 3 women to get ready for outings. Gambling was never so lucky for us. Machines were new with fresh games. Food was amazing and they worked to accommodate our schedule for shows.
30,We’ve stayed here many times and loved the place but it’s not the same as it used to be. Rooms are dated and the beds were not comfortable. Gaming was terrible. Where do you get your dealers? We know it’s going away but still it could have been better
40,The rooms are very clean and have an updated feel. The staff is excellent. Fast room service. The waitresses are very friendly and efficient at the pool. The pool is very nice one of the better looking pools In town and the atmosphere is great. The Beatles love show is beyond mind blowing performance. If all you do is go to the show here it is worth it! Would highly recommend this resort!!!
50,I might be a little bias i love all mgm properties so i might not be the best person to ask but from mgm to aria what can u say mgm & its properties know how to treat people especially gamblers so yeah im a loyal mgm customer
50,I was very pleased with the ease of checking in did not need to stand in any lines all done on my phone. Walked in to the MIrage and went straight to my room with my digital key. The room was nice and clean and conveniently located to elevators and restaurants. Highly recommended!
10,"We had a event for our daughter and didn't want to bring a large amount of cash on us. We marked the app no housekeeping put the sign outside the door and even called the front desk to tell them we don't need them. They still came in made our beds and now all our cash is gone. The front desk sent us to security and to make a report but that is it. The comment made to us from hotel security initally on phone was that ""How do we know it was housekeeping? It could have been anyone."" Crazy! common sense says they were in our room made our beds and the cash is gone. But it's someone else at the hotel that got into our room not housekeeping who makes our beds who we know was in our room. So frustrating when you did every last step to say don't come in!"
40,Only issue never received an itemized statement for the 2 rooms I reserved. The restaurants were very good though a few more medium priced restaurants would have nice. The show Love was amazing and is highly recommended. If you are not sure what show to go to then select Love …
50,I brought my teenage daughters for a trip to see Cirque Du Soleil shows. I felt safe and comfortable traveling alone with them. The mirage was an excellent choice for convenience quality and service. The concierge and front desk offered exceptional service and exceeded my expectations.
30,The casino is average. It's almost the same in 20 years. My last trip to this was 10 years ago. Not much has changed. It's a comfortable room is clean and good time to stay. It' easy to access to others casino.
40,Brought our 17 mo son. The pool was great for him and the dolphin secret garden. I wish the room fridge was not jam packed with items to buy because there was no room for me to chill my son’s milk so I constantly had to fill the ice bucket. Overall it was a good experience.
50,Another great trip at the Mirage..we have been going there for over 10 years now and never have had a issue here...highly recommend..staff is amazing also...especially our casino host Chase Connolly. Can't wait to go back soon.
50,My wife and I decided to take the kids to Vegas for a quick mid-summer trip. We chose The Mirage for its awesome family-friendly pool and close proximity to the middle of the action on the strip.  We were saddened to hear that this icon of Vegas will be transitioning soon to Hard Rock.  The fact that this may be our last stay at The Mirage made it extra special. It was built when I was 18 and now at 51 it still delivered!  Great stay!  Check it out while it is still here!  Thanks for the memories!
50,I liked the property very much. My room was very comfortable and clean with great linens. The room had the quietest air conditioning I've experienced. The staff I encountered were very kind and responsive.
10,They refused to honor our reservation because of a phoney do-not-book list This type of monopolistic top-down cancel culture is un-American and reeks of gangsterism I cannot recommend this hotel and urge tourists to stay elsewhere.
40,Nice experience at a Vegas hotel beginning with the aquarium and check-in. Large comfortable rooms. But when it converts it may not be all that great. Mini-fridge unusable - you can rent a real one but be careful not to take anything out (or put your own stuff in ) - they will charge you for it. Didn't dine or do shows but the conference area is very nice though some people will feel it is too far away from their room. Quick tip - if you need to go to Walgreens or cheap lunch go out the right side of the hotel past the Beatles show and Starbucks. You'll be inside longer and get the nice A/C.
10,The hotel was very out dated. The bathroom lights didn’t work the staff on duty said that you have to punch the switch in order to get it to turn on. Wall paper on the wall was very dirty and windows were dirty.
30,"They charged my card twice. I checked out the hotel early because a family death. When I was checking out . The Lady at front desk asked if I wanted a receipt and I said yes. She walked me over to another counter and asked for a remaining balance and resort fee. I told her I already paid it when I checked in! I checked my  balance of my checkings today and I have two transactions of the same amount for the deposit and resort fee. Kind of upsetting I was just trying to leave and get my receipt with no problem because she offered. She than asked again ""do you still want your reciept ? "" I was confused because that's why we're here right? After telling me I need to pay resort fee. Felt like I got scammed."
40,I like to have coffee while getting ready not having to get dressed and be the 20th person in line for overpriced starbucks. I would have brought a mini pot from home if I had known. Even very cheap places have it.
30,Casino is great and great location. The rooms are not our favorite at all and the customer service not great. Probably stay somewhere else next year. We come 1-2 times a year and usually don’t have this many issues in a trip
50,Best location on the strip close to everything rooms are very cleanfriendly staff the pools are the best on the strip good food the best value for the money. If you have kids this is a kids friendly place highly recommend .
30,Poor hospitality and customer service. Poor food quality and choices. Not living up to any LV standards. I would suggest to elsewhere if you are looking for a true LV experience verse family vacation center.
20,Stayed for a week for my wedding. The website advertised a $50 food and beverage credit. This was never coded correctly to my room and didn’t find out until day 3 into the trip. Reservation told me they couldn’t do anything about it. The room has a mildew smell as well as dirty vents so if you have allergies be warned. Cannot use the fridge as it’s a scale and will charge you. If you need a fridge (we did for my husbands insulin) it’s $35/day for a beat up fridge. No free parking on site (unless a top tier card holder). The location is fine but all of the little things made it kind of annoying & expensive!
50,Excellent employees made the difference. Beautiful rooms extremely clean. All restaurants were delicious though the post- Covid menus are much smaller than before as in all Casinos. From gaming to entertainment to the employees it was great❤️
20,We were celebrating our anniversary but unfortunately we had a horrible experience. First room we went was very dirty with food inside the minibar from the last guest trash in the floor disgusting. Front desk changed our room the same situation room was dirty and with trash in the floor from the last guest bottles under the bed restroom door was dirty with fingerprints it was the worst experience we had for the first time in Las Vegas.
50,I love staying at this hotel because you get a nice room for a reasonable price. The location is great. I love the ambience. I especially love the huge pool. It’s one of my favorite places on the strip!
50,We did a quick getaway trip and used the My Vegas Slots game to get a great deal at The Mirage. Location on the strip was perfect for us. We had a show at the south end and the Harris monorail stop was very close. We also used the monorail when we went to Sahara for another show. Quick access to the fashion mall and the forum shops if you like to shop.
30,I stayed at this hotel 10 years ago and enjoyed my time. However visiting recently I did not feel comfortable sleeping in my room. The room seemed unclean with dust and the bathroom shower looked dirty. The rooms are outdated. Also i’ve traveled and stayed at many different places. I’ve never had to worry about moving water bottles that were in the mini fridge area in fear of being charged over $15 for every item moved. I called services and they refunded me since I did not drink or eat anything that was moved and put them back. They resolved it but it was just another unnecessary stressor. The hotel atmosphere and features in the lobby/ casino/ restaurants / outside areas are awesome.
50,I live in St. George UT and just ran down with the family for a couple nights. We had fun swimming and eating great food. The Mirage is very clean with nice sized rooms. I loved the friendliness of the staff.
50,Excellent location good view of the strip affordable comfortable atmosphere inside the casino and the smoke isn't bad. We have stayed here several times and have never been disappointed. Always a good value for your dollar.
40,We came in July 2022. This was the second time I've stayed at the Mirage and just like before I loved the experience. I love the tropical island of the resort from the lobby's aquarium tank behind the check in desk to jungle oasis theme of the pool and the exciting volcano show on the strip. Just like with all MGM properties it is not the cheapest on the strip but it is worth every penny. I won't hesitate to stay again there as many times as possible before it gets demolished in favor of the Hard Rock Hotel. It is a shame the Mirage will be demolished.
50,Would stay here again! Atrium is beautiful great central location with tons around to see and do! Rooms are perfect! Lots of space and clean! We did book a view of the volcanos as well and found it was a little too far to enjoy the show. However not a deal breaker
50,Have always wanted to stay here and finally got to. The room was spacious and the pool was fantastic. The music wasn’t to loud and kids were under control. My 14 year old loves the water fall. Will be coming back soon.
30,We’ve stayed at the Mirage the last 3 years and go for the friendly prices as far as the rooms go. Unfortunately this trip was with the Mirage was not as we expected our room was not cleaned the second day of our stay - our Privacy door tag was on until we left our room at 10:00am and we returned after 3:00pm only to find our room still not cleaned. We are also part of the Mlife rewards we spent a good amount of money on MGM affiliated restaurants a show gambling slots and betting through sports book and we earned a  Minimal amount of points. On top of that none of the slots were hitting for any bonuses of jackpots and it was very hard to find a cocktail waitress for drinks. We walked across the way to both the Venetian and Palazzo where we won multiple times and got our moneys worth - they have more of a variety on slots (slots that pay) and excellent drink service - always a waitress to offer a drink while your gambling. In the future I will pay the extra money for a better stay elsewhere.
50,I’ve been coming to Vegas for 20+ years and Mirage is hands down the best hotel on the Strip. Their customer service is fantastic and they value your business. The staff is all very friendly and works to ensure all problems are remedied and they will make sure that you are happy. The pool is beautiful and spacious and we love the Siegfried and Roy Habitat. We’re so sad Mirage is closing. It will be greatly missed!
40,Staff went above and beyond to ensure my experience at the resort was enjoyable. Provided with the space and amenities to relax and unwind. The property location is located close to the monorail allowing guests to explore more of Las Vegas.
40,The Mirage is a decent hotel in a great location. Had an issue checking out as I waited in line for receipt I was greeted by an employee asking my information guaranteeing they would send one by 3PM that day. Here I am a week later getting a request for a review but still no receipt.    Pool is very nice grounds are in good condition but rooms could use updating. Hard Rock purchased this property so I expect that to happen in short order. If you visit make sure you watch the Volcano Show as there really isn't any clarification if Hard Rock intends to continue this attraction
50,I love the fact that I can check into this hotel instead of waiting in a long line All the food options at the hotel Are amazing the swimming area is beautiful the fall and a perk is is going to see the dolphin habitat
20,The hotel definitely needs updates. Not sure what the resort fee included but there was no fridge no coffee maker no microwave in room. The bathroom needs an upgrade on the shower. Not many food options within the hotel/casino. It was my birthday weekend probably won’t stay at the mirage again
20,No carts to run your bags to the room yourself? No coffee in the room? Can't use the refrigerator int he room without getting charged up the tailpipe? Good grief! Even Motel 6 has all that. Why get chumped again by returning???? Not for me.
20,Staff I’d friendly and the hotel was clean however I think sleeping on the floor would have been softer than the bed and my wife and I both became very I’ll after eating an extremely overpriced meal at the Heritage Steakhouse
10,We didn't touch anything in the fridge yet when we came back to the room one day there was a bunch of things in there missing that we were charged over $100 for. Complete rip off. Not sure if this is a tactic by the hotel themselves or if the cleaning ladies just go around stealing things out of the fridge so that the person in the room gets charged for it but something is wrong here that needs to be fixed.
50,Not only are they super courteous when you arrive and inquire about anything but they go out of their way to make you feel at home on vacation Military family and every single thing about this place is just next level  Cleanliness! Food! Pool! You name it Highly recommended!! Thank you The Mirage!
50,I thought the staff at the pool and restaurant were particularly good but all the staff were professional and friendly. Vegas appears to be phasing out 3/2 payouts on a blackjack which makes a huge difference but for the time being Mirage is still paying on the 25 dollar tables.
50,We really enjoyed our stay at the Mirage. The rooms are HUGE and CLEAN!!! This is certainly a busy place but even with our kids in tow we all loved it. The pool is crowded but SO nice and lifeguards are all around.  One tip of advice: DO NOT MOVE the stuff in the micro fridge. It is sensored and weighted and they will charge for everything and anything that's moved. We were lucky to get a very nice worked at the front desk who removed the charges for us.
20,Not interested in going back for sure. No coffee maker in the room. All power outlets and charging ports in the room did not work except one. Cirque du Soleil show was a disaster. Show had to stop multiple times for technical difficulties. Wasn't impressed
10,No coffee machine no fridge no microwave. They want you to buy everything downstairs. There were many nice things about the Mirage including central location but to not be able to make coffee in the room or store last nights leftovers in the fridge is a deal breaker. Never again.
40,Fourth Time in Vegas previous stays at the MGM and Bellagio. This Time I attended a Business Convention being held in the Palazzo so this Hotel was a cheaper option and very close to the Palazzo/Ventian Complex. With the Summer heat proximity to where you wanna go is a must unless you wanna walk serious time with over a 100° Sun. The Mirage is a very nice option pretty much in the Mid range kinda property not High End as you mightj expect from a Caesars Palace or Bellagio but nothing cheap as a Flamingo kind a property...so For me it was a great Hotel pretty much close to everything in the Strip great restaurants in the property Rooms were nice again nothong luxury but nice. Pool is nice too but be warn if yo dont get there at leat 15 minutes prior their opening there no chance you will get a Lounger..at leat during Summertime since Vegas is Packed...    Overall Great stay.
50,If you’re looking for a quick reasonably priced get away artsy mirage truly does a great job! It truly was a delightful time being in this hotel when there’s soooo many others to be at. Staff definitely friendly and humble here
30,We chose adjoining rooms and one of them had baby cockroaches crawling out of the drain and into the shower/tub every single day despite staff’s efforts to alleviate the issue. All they offered to compensate was a reversal of their resort fees.    TIP: They charge $35 per day for use of a portable mini fridge that you could purchase yourself for $75 nearby.    Apart from these issues this could have been an enjoyable stay. Breakfast at The Pantry was especially good.
20,Staff seemed fine. Layout is good. Check in was a breeze. Room and dog debacle nearby and plumbing noises were horrendous. Also Mirage has a great scent but the room was overwhelmingly musty. Didn't notice at first as I threw my bag down and was out the door but it was bad.
50,Simple check in and checkout with the app. Great service always with a smile. Very clean room cleaning very thorough and detailed. Bellman very helpful and accommodating easy access to all of the services offered.
40,Staying at the Mirage has always been on my wish list and our recent stay did not disappoint. The pool was everything I thought it would be and made our stay. We had no complaints around the hotel and the room was spacious.
20,the restaurants could be better. i was there for a conference the prices were good but the restaurants do not have the hours open i needed. i did not come to play i came for serious business and i need food with out leaving the hotel and search the city. I do not have time for it. and i want to talk to my clients without shouting at them to be heard. Noise level way to high
50,Mirage is truly a hidden gem!!!! Stay was peaceful and quiet. My family and I had a wonderful time and can’t wait to stay at Mirage again. The front desk staff was very helpful and friendly. We were treated like vip.
40,We enjoyed our stay during The Freedom Fest at The Mirage. The hotel staff was extremely professional and friendly everywhere we went. Our room was the rights size and comfortable for 5 days. I would definitely come back to stay again in the future.
40,"Fantastic location attentive service at least one amazing restaurant (the Heritage steakhouse) and THE BEATLES + Cirque du Soleil! Not the best in Vegas but a very solid property a true self-contained Vegas ""experience."""
50,it was fun! we enjoyed staying at the mirage. we missed the buffet but there are nice restaurants.  The pool was very nice and I  really the casinos and bar at the mirage. I will go back and I will recommend it to friends.
40,Location is great! Volcano show is something that will be missed. Room needed maintenance. Bed was comfortable. Some restaurants were not open all day every day which sucked. Pool was amazing. Had a cabana for 1 day and it was needed to have a place to get out of the sun.
20,The hotel is pleasant the staff was hit or miss some nice and some rude. Check in took more than 40 minutes after I was at the counter because there was an error within the reservation. The shower curtain in our room had black mold spots on it I did take a photo but never got around to complaining. The mini fridge was stocked I asked for it to be emptied and I was told I had to ask for a rental fridge for 35 bucks a night. I think I will be sticking to Hilton properties which offer an empty free mini fridge. Clean rooms and super friendly staff.
30,I am a huge fan of MGM hotels and have stayed at Mirage in the past (pre-pandemic) . My last review was 5 stars for this property.  However this time; the stay was not up to the mark.  1. Cleanliness - Major let down. The bedsheets had stains on them and had to call up twice to get them changed  2. Cleanliness - Bath Tub had hair from previous occupants. Clearly not Cleaned . Those were visible. God knows what else would be there  3. Cleanliness - Bathroom had drainage issues and had notified the cleaning staff twice  4. I paid extra for strip view and all that was visible was Treasure Island hotel amidst a lot of walls. Clear letdown even after paying extra for a strip view    Maybe its because the staff knows that they have been taken over and the same service levels are not to be maintained.  Also this hotel charges a bomb for any incoming packets for guests @ Fedex office by Weight...so please take note of it.  Overall this stay was a disappointment by MGM and Mirage Standards.
50,Our recent stay at the mirage was excellent. Friendly staff. Really nice rooms. Excellent food at a variety of restaurants and lots of tables open for play. Good value also and central location. Close to everything
40,Location & value of this property is why I have been here 7 times as is the pool with the waterfall massage!! Tried the private oasis this time and it great if you want a little quieter time without all the kids splashing
50,Super clean friendly staff and perfect atmosphere. Rhumbar was the perfect vide with great music and even better drinks. No complaints about the room even has the volcano view. Ever staff member addressed and greeted me throughout my stay.
50,Very friendly staff location is great rooms are decent and clean.    Casino staff are very cool and friendly.    Love the pool they are big my family loved the water fall.    Restaurant are good loved the Pantry for breakfast!
40,Great pool. Clean room. Bathroom was not well cleaned but otherwise well kept. Casino looked and felt a little dated but was still fun and the waitresses were very attentive and accommodating. Gift shops way overpriced. Overall good stay.
30,In my opinion the hotel has gone down somewhat since I was there last (2019). Hotel location is excellent. We love the pool but pool music wasn''t that good. No draft beer at pool bars. Chairs at the edge of the pool must be rented. No change given out by the redemption machines (new MGM policy). The buffet was closed. I liked the buffet breakfast in the morning. If I go back to Vegas we will stay someplace else.
50,1st time staying at the Mirage. Usually stay at a Ceasars property. The hotel is perfectly set on the strip. A short walk from the front to the boulevard. Check in was super easy from the MGM app. There is a tram from Mirage to Treasure Island it's also an easy walk without having to walk on the boulevard. Main Pool was gorgeous and fun lots of families having fun just know it's not a pool you can sit and relax at. Lots of kids jumping and splashing and just having a memorable time. Overall a really nice and beautiful resort. No problems whatsoever.
50,Love the Mirage. Great memories for past 25 years. So sad to see it go. Married at Treasure Island July 4 1998 (stayed at Mirage). Been coming since 1996. Property has always been maintained and updated. Staff has always been awesome. Just had our last trip with our 21 year old son. RIP Mirage.
50,The Merage Hotel was outstanding in providing our needs during our stay we really appreciate it our family is looking forward to visiting again in the future Thanks Again for making our vacation the best..
50,I liked seeing the volcano erupt every night that I was there from the room that I was in. Somebody told me that it was going to be removed in the near future. So sad. I will miss it. The room was excellent. The staff and maids were very friendly and helpful. I didn't win any money gambling but that’s the was it goes.
50,We have been going to the Mirage for over 25 years. It is sad that MGM sold this property! It is the landmark in Vegas. We hope we can find another property we enjoy like this one. We will try the Hardrock once and see how it goes
30,Not enough reasonably priced restaurant options. No usable mini-fridge in the rooms and if you even touch the contents that they have stocked in their room mini-fridges you are charged an astronomical fee. Parking should be included in resort fees.
50,Had a great stay in June at the Mirage! Went with another couple eho had never been to Vegas and really enjoyed all that the Mirage had to offer. We will miss the volcano when it's no longer there! The pool and the Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat were great daytime activites. We enjoyed the restaurants Beatles LOVE and the night life in the casino after.
30,The Check-in guy really ruined our stay 😒 We wanted to address it while we were there but didn't want to suffer having to see or deal with him again so we waited to address in the survey. Someone like him should not be allowed to represent The Mirage
20,I traveled to this resort and casino as a part of a work trip. It was understaffed. It was not the cleanest. Oh and worst of all the staff was rude. I would not recommend to anyone as there are much better places to stay on the strip.
50,"Checked in late due to flight times and we were told that check in is at 3pm and that the hotel was overbooked so due to our late check in our room was no longer available. They found a room for us but not what we had reserved. Overselling the hotel shouldn't be a guest problem when the reservation was made a month in advance and our check in was late due to flight time. Sound like it's ""first come first serve"" now! Don't be late checking in!!!"
40,They are changing the mirage to a Hard Rock hotel which means they are not updating anything! Pool chairs are a disaster if you can even find one.  Love the size of this hotel because it is not super huge. Staff is nice.  Mattress in our room felt old and worn. Last time rooms were redone was 2014. Totally unacceptable!
50,Very beautiful pool and very nice room and wonderful food at the restaurants. Casino floor very nice size. Very well located very easy to get around to try the other place in town. The volcano outside is very cool.
50,Very nice hotel clean and the service is good.Nice location within the strip very central to lots of action.Good restaurants. The pool was very accessible with lots of chairs and great atmosphere.The gambling hall is inviting and exciting.
50,My daughter had a dance competition and convention in the convention center of the property. It was delightful to have the pool and dining so conveniently located. The price and service where excellent.
50,We absolutely love the Mirage. We’re very very sad to see it go. We love the pool the Beatles Love show the location and the Tiger habitat. Definitely going to not be the same Vegas without the Mirage in the skyline
50,We always stay at the mirage. The location is great and the staff is always welcoming and friendly. The oasis pool is our favorite place to kick back and relax while we are here. We certainly can’t wait for next summers trip!
50,It could’ve been cleaner but overall it was great and will be extremely missed when replaced by hard rock. :(  It wasn’t super busy when I went and the staff let me check in early with no extra charge.
40,Several parts of the hotel were well worn. Since it was sold to Hard Rock the staff was not happy about working there. Helping guest felt like more of a pain than enjoyment. Reward memberships were not explained or offered. I felt like I was a burden to the check in staff
40,Got a strip view king room. Great view of the pool and the strip. Room was ready early and mobile check-in was very easy. Room was in good condition and clean. I would recommend getting an actual key card made as the mobile app wasn’t working when I returned to my room at 1am and I had to go to the front desk to get a key made.
50,Easy check in and out. Beautiful room. Everyone was very helpful if we had any questions at all. Beautiful pool area also. Only bad thing was alarms going off at two in the. Morning for about 20 minutes.
50,Nice comfortable good rooms good food at the pantry swimming pool area very relaxing  The aroma as you walk into the casino really nice coconut smell the bar area next to the receptionist area good location meanwhile we check out
50,Enjoyed the food selections and shops as well as casino offering. Conference rooms were conveniently located and all personnel very pleasant. They want 200 characters so I am adding this even though all was stated above.
50,Excelente customer service and the hotel was clean really love our stay will be back soon  one of the best hotels in Vegas! The food was also great we stayed in many hotels before and the mirage has become one of our favorites
50,I frequently visit Las Vegas and my favorite place to stay is the Mirage because everything is easy to find. In addition the staff who work there are always very friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and you always have enough towels and if you don’t you can always ask for extra and the towels will be delivered in no time.
50,The Mirage is a very well maintained hotel. We totally enjoyed our stay. The staff is fire and very helpful. The concierge helped us plan our stay by getting us tickets to a show in another hotel. Those tickets were real close to the stage.
50,fun time with business ppl that was fun entertaining. loved seeing good people that mean a lot to me my family and my company. always loved vegas and the atmosphere that has been around me for years!!
50,Very enjoyable casino was sharp and my room was very clean. Staff was friendly and all restaurants were excellent. There are many places to choose from to eat at and never was a wait. The pool area looked amazing as well.
50,I had a fabulous time at the Mirage. My room was nice and comfortable. Though the only downfall was that the ceiling was too low that I could touch it without trying and the bathroom floors were slippery. But those things didn't ruin my trip. I'll definitely return. The bars and entertainment were great and the casino itself was awesome.
10,Three hours to check-in! We are long term MLife members credit card and all which makes us Platinum MLife. We use our rewards and purchase comp rooms and upgrade to suites at all MLife hotels. Never have we been denied an opportunity to upgrade until today. Initially we were told there were no penthouse suites or any other type of suite available. We asked for a manager Saul Gonzales and we were told that we could upgrade to a Hospitality Suite. Saul said we would have to pay $250 per night plus resort fees. We agreed. He walked away and stayed away for approximately 45 minutes. When we asked what he was doing he said he was looking for our room. After an hour and one half he returned and said he was doing us a favor to look for a suite but there were none available. We said you just booked it. He said VIP gave it to a VIP guest for 4 nights and they're paying $900 a night for the suite. FYI VIP's are comped they pay nothing. He then said we could have a Penthouse Suite for one night and then change rooms. He walked away again and came back and said we can't have the Penthouse Suite. He said it was given to another guest. I then explained to him what it meant to be in the hospitality business. You don't do guests favors you accommodate them. He offered a regular room with a strip view. The Mirage will be closing soon because the hotel desperately needs renovation. Only the suites are still maintained nicely. We're two hours checking in and still no room. Saul goes to get another manager Darren and Darren tells us there are no suites whatsoever for an upgrade. We said there is a Penthouse suite available for one night. He said yes but you'll have to change rooms. We said we will check tomorrow because things change people cancel and there are no shows. We'll speak to management tomorrow. Three hours to check in and finally we got to the room exhausted. The bidet in the bathroom leaked water all over the floor.
40,Having a coffe maker and fridge on every room would make the stay even better. All housekeeping staff and front desk were above and beyond on every request snd they all responded quickly and very polite. We would stay again in the future.
50,Loved the property!! Room was very nicely appointed. The restaurants were excellent. We really enjoyed the casino! It was very hot outside so we spent the majority of our trip inside & had a blast!!
40,Excellent view of the volcano and the strip… reasonable price… wanted to stay here because I watched the movie “Vegas Vacation.” Looked almost like the movie… The room is dated… the shower curtain is dingy… but over all I had a great time staying there…
50,We enjoyed it very much ! Very nice clean and very friendly nice rooms employees were very happy helpful and glad to have us...  We are actually headed back in a few weeks and looking forward to staying at the mirage again
50,Our Mirage experience was amazing. It starts the moment you walk in the door. The scent is one you miss as soon as you get home. The staff were super friendly and knowledgeable. The view from our room was exceptionally amazing. We could see the strip and the volcano. Food selection the room room service everything was great!! Can’t wait to visit again.
50,I love the lush greenery waterfalls & volcanos this hotel. Still my favorite grounds out of all the Vegas hotels. It's a shame & so disappointing that they're going to tear it down and make a Hard Rock hotel & casino.
50,Checked in late and was upgraded to a suite with no extra charge. Great staff. So sad they were bought and will be changing and getting rid of the volcano. Love the tropical feel of the hotel and the pool is amazing.
30,My husband and I just stayed here for three nights it was our first vacation outside of Canada in over two years. This is a fair review.    For starters the pool was absolutely fantastic. Really fast service with towels drinks and if you wanted food. Even though all the chairs were full quite early in the day we still managed to find a spot along the waterfall.    Casino is OK very very busy and could use some upgrades. The drinks are super pricey (including water) and the restaurants were just OK nothing blew us away. We had better experiences and options at the LINQ for food.    The room was pretty brutal faint smell of vomit no use of the fridge unless you plan on acquiring room charges. If you accidentally touch any snacks above the fridge it auto charges you. We had to fill the sinks with ice. Lots of dust throughout the room it was pretty disappointing. The bathtub still had hairs in it. We didn’t use it and weren’t planning on it anyway. We had to purchase shampoo and conditioner as they did not lather properly. They were garbage.    The service was pretty good fast check-in housekeepers are super friendly and always helpful.    Overall we won’t stay here again but glad we experienced it before Hardrock takes over.
50,We decided to stay at The Mirage during the weekdays and was very happy with the friendly staff not very crowded and is very easy to move around with out getting turned around. Has great restaurants good shows and close proximity to great shopping.
50,This is the first trip that I take my whole family including my two-year-old granddaughter. We love the hotel with all the amenities and the pools were beautiful. My family and I will definitely stay here again if we decided to visit Vegas
50,Hotel was very nice. Staff was very friendly. Good location. There was a lot to do right in the area including restaurants shopping shows and several hotels to explore. I would definitely stay here again.
50,My favorite resort in Vegas. Classy but not pretentious. Friendly staff good restaurants and bars. Can get on tables here and play blackjack for $15. 6:5 which is a ripoff but whatever. Rooms are clean. Pool is spectacular.    Gym is awful but has what you need. No coffee in the room need to stand in line and pay $5 for Starbucks.    Aging gracefully. Going back in November. Prices are decent. Shame Hard Rock bought it and it's going to changeover in 2023.    Highly recommend.
50,Easy to find casino and easy parking. Hotel front desk did ask if I wanted to upgrade for half off original price which I did $75 for a suite with a nice city view. Not bad. Clean room and very cozy. My son enjoyed the suite plenty of room to run around.
40,Wonderful staff capable and pleasant. Room was clean and comfortable but a/c noisy and strip lights kept us up. Pool is great but don't get there long after it opens or you will not get a chair! Gambling was ok. Food was good shops ok. Needs more late night food options. Overall stay was nice and location was great.
50,I’ve always loved the vibe of this hotel. Customer service is great! Place was very clean. Every hotel worker was very nice and said thank you. We were greeted by people just walking to our room. The smell of the air is just so refreshing.
10,If not at a restaurant (in which case you have to order food) or a bar (in which case you have to order dinks) there is not a SINGLE sitting area. Had to wait for friends after lunch with 3 little ones (can’t take to bar) NO where to go!! Very disappointing.
40,Considering that Mirage has already sold I am impressed that the wheels have not come off. I love and will miss the spectacle of the Volcano. I think that it is a staple of the LV Strip second only to the fountains. I had a good time on this trip. My room was on the second floor and that was not a nice view. However the room was fine so long as you didn't want a view of anything. The pool is better than most the casino is fun I can't complain.
50,The Mirage is still the perfect place to stay as is. No reason to rip out the volcano and dolphins to change it. Go see the volcano before it goes away forever 😢😢😢. Also remember to visit the dolphins one more time.
40,Great location great customer service from the staff lots of food and shows! Rooms can be better I can deal with them being older but broken and dirty is not ok. Thank you so much for listening! 🙏🏽😊
50,We love The Mirage. We’ve made many memories there over the past 20 years. It’s an absolute shame it is being torn down. The only hotel on the strip with wonderful choices of “non-pretentious” restaurants.
50,Overall great convenient property on the strip. Central to many of the area’s attractions. Great rewards program for Vets and members too! Free parking is a big life saver as it can get expensive on the strip.
50,Nice clean rooms. One of the best family pools in Vegas and really close to surrounding popular casinos. This trip was to relax and with the nice pool and bar right next to it I was able to do just that! Will definitely be the place we revisit when going back to Las Vegas!
50,Every staff member I spoke with was friendly helpful and kind. I was very happy with my first time at the mirage and would highly recommend it especially before they take our the volcano to build a new tower. Must see attraction!
50,Came here for a quick weekend getaway. It was nice using the MGM app to checkin avoiding long lines and I was able to enjoy my trip. Friendly staff. Clean cold rooms. I would definitely book here again.
50,One of the best resorts I've stayed in. The staff is both friendly and professional making you feel like they are happy you are staying there. Rooms are spacious and immaculate with very comfortable decor. Beds are great. Location couldn't be better middle of strip close to both the Monorail and Deuce Bus which can take you to the downtown and to the end of the strip if you want to visit casino's there. Definately well worth a stay here.
50,Thank you for the hospitality and services. Me and my wife are highly appreciative. After working such long hours in the hospital I much needed the stay and relaxation. Thank you to the staff and all workers in the casino.
20,"This was supposed to be a nice weekend getaway for my wife and I.  The first room we checked into had a smell as if someone threw up inside and the smell was still lingering. We requested a room change and asked if we could be somewhere closer to the elevator. We received a handicap room. That okay but we couldn't take a shower without squatting down. Regardless after a shower there is not way to keep the bathroom floor dry the entire bathroom floor was filled with water. Nobody said that we were wheel chair bound and needed something like this.  The entrance of the room i believe had solid floors. The bedroom had carpet. Let me be clear ""dirty carpet"". Please feel free to check the room that we stayed in. I floors have not been vacuumed in quite some time. The room just felt dirty."
50,I didn’t like the location of our room  2 057 looking over the roof . People had throwing trash out the window over the roof they look like nobody clean up the trash they look very clean. The security was excellent. I just wish the ice machine had more ice .
50,The Mirage is aging but still has the polish you need in a proper Casino property. The dolphin habitat is pretty nice as is the tropical garden in the main atrium. The rooms are clean bright and almost up to date. They could use some updated USB outlets and a power outlet accessible for the nightstand but there are plenty of power outlets in the room and bathroom.
50,We enjoyed our stay in Mirage Hotel. The staff are very nice and helpful with our needs. The bed & pillows are very comfortable. The cleaning lady made sure that our room is clean and tidy before coming back to our room🥰
50,It is always a pleasure to stay and play at The Mirage Hotel & Casino. We always enjoy our stay! The team members at The Mirage are always happy and helpful! This always means a lot when we are choosing where we are going to enjoy our time. Thank you for keeping your guests happy!
50,Finally made it to staying at the infamous Mirage where the Griswald's checked in in Las Vegas Vacation. The Aquarium behind the check in desk is still there in all it's unique self very nice. Got a room with a nice view where one could see the Volcano a few times a night before it's gone as the rumors have new owner The Hard Rock removing the historic Volcano to build a guitar shaped tower hotel where the Volcano currently sits. The room was super clean and comfortable very nice and room in this was was super good with strip and the Volcano view guaranteed upgrade. One could even open the window a bit to hear the sounds of the streets outside just a few inches not too much but a bonus none the less. Only negative i have is teasing guests with a refrigerator that only has incredibly overpriced items in which if you even lift them up a bit to look at you get charged for. There was not even a list of prices for items so you know ahead of time what the costs are. Personally i would rather pay a few bucks more and have an actual fridge i could use in the room. Will be sad to see this place go very much enjoyed the stay.
20,Hotel was quite literally overbooked as told by the front desk manager. Mobile check in worked for our friends but was a bust for us. They got their room 4 hours before us and we were awkwardly waiting with our luggage.    Room was half nice. For the price I would stay at park. Room felt pretty gross and quickly cleaned. Hair and used toilet still unflushed when we arrived
50,We had amazing service. From the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out all our needs were met or exceeded. They found a large room to accommodate my family of 7 and the housekeeping staff were lovely and willingly got us everything we asked for. Also the most comfortable hotel bed I’ve slept in ever!
40,Hotel is due for some updates but lots of shows and eatery nearby! Enjoyed our stay due to the friendly staff  restaurants and shows!!!!!  Bathroom size and questionable elevators were our only complaints
30,Dated hotel where front desk want pick up no matter when you call them. To many kids running around unsupervised and to much noise in the hallways. Only saving grace was the decent location to everything.
50,My niece performed and won a scholarship. Nice ball room and had everything we needed in a hotel. We had a wonderful time awesome pool and casino and car rental place one stop and shop. Everything was wonderful.
50,Stayed at the venetian hotel fab it was our 11th trip to las vagas stayed at tha mirage 6 times we are going again on christmas day staying at the mirage for 5 nights i cant wait its my most favourite place ever
50,Loved the location property pool room bed and pillows staff it was immaculate wait staff at Tom Colicchio's Heritage restaurant  and smell. This is an iconic legendary and classy place. We were impressed and will be back !!
50,Very nice room. Staff was super helpful. Very clean room whole time room was cleaned. Casino was kept clean and always wiped down the machines. Was super satisfied with the visit I had. I would recommend that if you want a good hotel you must stay at The Mirage.
50,clean rooms friendly staff ( All staff) security room service delivery and cleaning staff drink servers table game staff bartenders Everyone was friendly and helpful could answer any question we had
50,Stayed at a higher-end Caesars’ property(buddy’s choice) the first couple nights and had problems with the room from the beginning with a/c not working TV not working & possible mold. We decided to stay an extra night and I checked us into the Mirage for more than half of nightly rate we were paying and our room was ready 2 hours before check-in and the room was clean and spotless just like every room I’ve stayed in before at MGM Properties.. Mlife rewards in my opinion are way better than Caesars too!
50,Love the location the rooms and the awesome team at the Mirage! This is our second trip to Las Vegas and we always enjoy staying with MGM…we can always count on a positive experience. I can’t thank them enough!
50,Love staying at the Mirage. The best rooms and location everyone is so helpful great place.  We have been coming to Vegas for over 40 years about twice a year. Hope we can get these  great deals and come back soon.
50,3rd time staying at the Mirage! Love the location. However the had a Dance competition going on with kids from 5 to teens…crazy busy! Think we will check next time! Kids were all over and the pool…..
50,Great Hotel! Loved everything about it! Super friendly staff clean rooms great pool! Stayed in a stay well room and loved it! No smoking and comfy beds. Nothing bad to say at all other than I wish it was on a higher floor! Greta experience.
50,Even though the Mirage has been around a long time it’s still a fantastic place to stay. The tropical theme is so pleasant with all the palm trees and fresh flowers and waterfalls. The location is one of the best in Las Vegas. The pool is THE BEST one in Vegas. Very friendly staff and you can’t beat the value for everything you get.
40,Returned here for a second visit because of the great pool! Get there early because chairs get covered with towels from guests. I did like the fact that a few lifeguards would remove towels from chairs that were unoccupied for a long period of time. Plenty of food choices and the resort is centrally located to everything. It’s become more of a family resort. Was not expecting to see SO MANY KIDS! Be prepared
20,Horrible check in experience. 4 rooms within 12 hrs. Horrible waitstaff and food was served cold on two occasions. Staff even shared with us MGM doesn’t care about staff or guests. Doesn’t make me want to come back again.
50,Right on the strip and first stay at the mirage  a lot of Activities you can do. Everything right at the hotel . The only thing is hard to find the parking garage . The ice Machine on the second floor was not working that well .
40,It's a solid resort for a Vegas getaway. Service staff was professional and very friendly. Room was nice and big and clean.  And probably one of the best pools on the Strip The lack of a food court really limits your casual/cheap dining options but there is stuff across the street. Not sure how it'll do as a Hard Rock Hotel but right now it's a great choice.
40,Hotel is showing its' age and appears that management is deferring maintenance in anticipation of new owners planned renovation. The room assigned to us had a significant leak in the bathroom. We were offered an upgrade to 27th floor suites but when electronic key updated it was just another ROH; nothing special. We were disappointed.
50,Mirage never disappoints in making for a fabulous vacation. The staff is always great and attentive. Great rooms great spa great pool! The casino offers all the table games and has enough open so usually not a wait to get on and play the game of your choice.
50,Perfect location nice and clean room pool area is beautiful but to save a seat you have to be there when they open at 8am. If you don’t reserve sun-beds for a ridiculous amount of $. Only negative was that the sound from outside was disturbing.
40,Everything was wonderful except you went outside 2 hours early to line up for the pool after being there for and hour you were told to move into the hallway were there was already a Hugh line you felt like a jerk if you got in front of everyone but you were already waiting and hour out like we have in the past. They need to put a sign up to let everyone know what to do.
50,We loved our stay at The Mirage! It’s an awesome hotel and has a great location in the middle of the strip. Very clean and has plenty of things to do see and eat on the property as well! We will definitely recommend this property to friends and family.
50,Check in went smoothly staff was nice and very knowledgeable. Hotel was very well kept poll DJ was great pool was perfection. Booking through the mgm app made it easy to line up plans with the stay.
50,Good customer service from start to finish good food & entertainment good pools good location on the strip good ambiance overall a great hotel & casino. We always have a good time staying at the Mirage!
50,Had an excellent vacation. Rooms were very clean. All staff from housekeeping to other staff were friendly and there to do whatever they could to make our holiday awesome. I would recommend anyone to stay at the Mirage.
40,Professional courteous and friendly staff that go above and beyond most places we have been. Food is WAY overpriced but that's Vegas for you =). Both my wife and myself are VERY pleased we chose to stay here and would do so again.
50,Had a great time everyone was very the room was nice the house cleaning people were nice hate to see you change to hardrock will miss seeing the valcone I have been going to the Mirage ever since it opened
50,Was amazing and staff was excellent MGM treats you good. See volcano show hope hard rock doesn’t get rid of it. Room was clean not troubles in that department. Bell hop service was excellent and reservations staffing were superb.    Keep up the great job Mirage and MGM.
50,Second time in Vegas and this time it was fun super clean room. me and my wife had a great time. Ready to go again more things to do can't wait . Nothing more to say counting down till till the next t
50,Love the Mirage we are always treated very well there. The casino is fabulous the restaurants are great and we really enjoy the pool. The service is always outstanding we had dinner at Costa this time it was really nice. Our room was upgraded and a late checkout was provided for free.
50,We haven’t stayed at The Mirage in over 15 years & it was wonderful. Everything was very clean and the pool was amazing because of not overcrowding with chairs. All the food was delicious at the restaurants too.We would stay there again.
50,Great experience! Outstanding really nice rooms! Was able to get extra towels from housekeeping and a lot of awesome options for food around you. Great place to play hard and sleep hard! 😂 Overall would come again!
50,First class service from the rooms to the hotel restaurants. The conference area is also very comfortable for business meetings both large and small. The Mirage Hotel and Casino has been an annual favorite of mine for more than 10 years.
50,The ambience and beauty of the Mirage is awesome. Our suite was super nice/clean and was in a great location with a wonderful view of the strip and fountains at Bellagio. Sometimes it is very hard to find a waitress for drink service but once the waitress starts coming they come often.
50,I love The Mirage ! It's a wonderful hotel and more family-oriented. The landscaping is gorgeous especially around the pool and all the trees allow for much-needed shade.    The hotel employees are helpful and friendly and everyone we came across greeted us warmly and wished us a good day. The rooms are superb quiet spacious and comfortable. The bathroom is also spacious.    This is our second stay at The Mirage and we don't want to stay anywhere else. We missed seeing the volcano this time and were disappointed that there will be changes made to the hotel. We feel that The Mirage is wonderful as it is and don't see a need to improve!
40,Room was very clean towels were like new nice and thick. Lots of choice for dining. Staff was friendly. Whats missing is a coffee pot  too bad that one has to go so far for that cup of java when you need it first thing
50,Overall a great place to stay on the strip. Great location with easy access to all the other venues restaurants and shows Vegas has to offer. Mirage pool is great! But busy in summer so if you can afford it pre-pay and book a lounge chair with umbrella either at main pool or more private Oasis Pool. You’ll be happy you did when it’s 40 deg C!!! Mirage has decent restaurants with a wide variety of price ranges. Rooms (Stay Well floor) are good size and clean. The hotel has been there a long time and Is starting to show a need for a “refresh” but still a great place to stay. Most of what I’m referring to is minor and really doesn’t impact your stay too much but you notice it (i.e. inside of elevator doors are heavily worn with small dents etc and worn carpets in some areas…:but again these are not show stoppers). With Hard Rock taking on ownership of Mirage there likely will be some updating taking place so a refreshed look is inevitable. Looking forward to returning!
50,My first time at the Mirage. I enjoyed the property and only left once. Everyone was kind and helpful. I like the size. The casino is not too large the rooms not too far away and the food choices were good. I came to see Kathleen Madigan and had a great getaway!
50,"Great room very clean a very safe place to stay very good places to eat. was a great 5 days.loved staying there one of the best places I""ve ever stayed in the shops are great and they all have very nice people working in them I will always remember this Hotel ."
50,The hotel and casino provided very fast and friendly service! The suite had great view and was very clean and bed was very comfortable. Used the room service and the food was great and the kitchen was extremely fast getting food to room.
30,Rooms were fine but staff and waitress service lacking. Elevator key is annoying. No other casino on strip is like this. Great pool and ambiance. Good mix of restaurants. Guest service staff is not real friendly or helpful.
50,The room was clean. The service was amazing. They gave me the room price with my players card and it was free. I was pleasantly surprised no hidden fees at the end of the stay. I thought my bill was going to be a little higher due to resort fees but it was only $28.00. Great trip.
50,Thrilled with the entire experience! Beautiful hotel enjoyed our room and most comfortable bed ever!!!! Would love to know what type of mattress you use :-) Would have loved more casual food options open 24-hours.
50,Delightful and entertaining. Truly a place to recharge! Parking was a breeze being an MLife member. Mobile check in via the App and ease to access your room via your phone device is super simple. No need for room key which provides peace of mind. The room access was secure starting with elevator access to only hotel guest. Rooms were found clean and stocked and spacious. Totally a great mirage experience!
50,Arrived around 11am and was told my room was ready at no extra charge great. We headed down to the pool enjoying the waterfall and drinks. That night we ate at Diablos Mexican food and as always it was great. At 8pm went out front and watched the Volcano show! Day 2 was another fun day with pool gambling and the Beatles LOVE show that I highly recommend. After the show got a bite at the California Kitchen it hit the spot. Day 3 if it's not broken don't try to fix it! After breakfast gambled some hit the pool and met some nice people that evening headed down to Excalibur for the Bee-gees show! had a great time! Heard the Mirage is changing into The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino. I'm sure gonna miss her!
50,I use to stay to different hotels in Vegas not the very expensive ones but some like Circus Circus Stratosphere Luxor Excalibur Golden Nugget South Point maybe some others…. I decided to get a regular room to Mirage for the 4th of July weekend.  The room was unexpected welcoming very clean and a pleasure to just be in.  Definitely I am planning to stay again to Mirage.  Also this is my first review ever for a hotel or almost anything….. I don’t give reviews.
50,Everyone was great...especially the valet team. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The housekeeping staff made sure we had plenty of towels and were very friendly. Had a blast in the pool. Can't wait to go back again.
50,Thank you for a very nice stay at The Mirage. I have been a Mlife member for years and this was my first stay here. A very nice room and comfortable amenities I was very impressed with Shin Lim and Colin Cloud . I will definitely visit again.
50,Everyone was very nice and helpful things were conveniently located food was amazingly delicious and our room was fabulous very comfortable! The staff seemed to go above and beyond to help us with whatever we were trying to do. Excellent vacation!
50,The Mirage exceeded my expectations with hospitality accommodations and pricing.    From the outside The Mirage looked a bit dated. I found parking to be very convinent in the property's garage. After a short walk into the lobby I was pleasantly surprised. The interior was bright open and updated. The staff was amazing during the check-in process and throughout the stay. The casino was well-laid-out. making navigation easy. The rooms were equipped with all of the things you'd expect to find. The only knock I have and it's to be expected is there were no microwaves the room and the fridges did not have space for anything except the pre-stocked snacks that cost $1000 each.    Overall I would recommend The Mirage to friends and would stay again.
50,Beautiful hotel. Great stay. Very clean!  I don’t think I have any complaints. The pool is amazing. If they really go through with tearing this down it will be a shame! It was my first time in Vegas and I would love to stay there again
50,I had so much fun at my stay at the Mirage. My room was so beautiful and it was a standard Every single employee from housekeeping to management went out of their way to make my stay memorable. I went to The Beatles Cirque de Solei and loved every second of it. The best time I had was gambling While I didn’t win big I won enough to play my entire stay. Fun! Fun! Fun! I ate at three of the restaurants and the food was amazing. Room service was speedy and delious and really not that expensive.
40,I wish there was no smoking in the casino. The shower/tub is not good for a person 6’5”. The staff was friendly and the room was clean. I had one issue with the Pantry Restaurant. I ordered a cheeseburger. It was presented with no lettuce no tomato no mayo and no ketchup. The burger with a beer was $30. Really??? Worst burger I’ve ever eaten.
50,Nice clean room. Comfortable bed. Nice cold a/c. The pool was great and the drinks were even better. Over all a great stay. We will be coming back on our annual trip. Lots of slots to choose from. It was just a great stay
50,Excellent facilities!! Excellent Service! Great casino! Great restaurants! Wait staff truly enhance this establishment. Very attentive and knowledgeable. Made our stay even more enjoyable. Would stay at the Mirage again without question!!
50,Great hotel clean friendly staff centrally located. Check in and check out were easy housekeeping was was attentive. We dined at several of the restaurants for breakfast lunch and dinner. Food was always above average and service was adequate.
50,I was fortunate to be able to stay for 5 nights. I was comped 3 of those nights which was incredible as I had originally made reservations for a different property. My room was beautiful even though I didn’t spend much time in it. I spent a lot of time gaming in the casino. Every employee that I came in contact with was friendly and extremely helpful.
50,For the past 10 years we have chosen to stay at the Mirage. Why fun for all#1. 2nd feels like a resort so good! 3rd wonderful staff from the check in until check out so accommodating anything you need just call. Prices are high for everything but you are on vacation so plan accordingly.
50,Service was exceptional room was roomy and sparkling clean. The casino was lively and vibrant but like most strip casinos the tae limits were alittle high for my taste. We ate twice at Snacks and regardless of where we stay next time - I will be going there for the chicken sandwich.
50,Clean room check in and check out was done quickly all personal friendly and accommodating with any needs I had. always stay at the Mirage when I come to Vegas and never had a complaint each visit was great.
50,Great hotel! Only complaint is the price of everything but that is Vegas! Rooms were great pool was awesome (get there early if you didn't reserve a chair!) staff was awesome great food in all of the restaurants. Great location on the strip! We stayed here because we were attending a show in the Mirage Theatre and it was so awesome to be back in the room quickly afterwards!
50,The rooms are more spacious than nearby resorts the pool is beautiful with plenty of seating the dining options are plentiful the there are great games to choose among and the property is definitely going to be missed.
50,Very nice rooms. Staff very friendly and helpful. Right out the front doors and you are on the strip. Multiple places to eat in the hotel as well as right on the strip. Gilleys is close as well. Casino is very nice and as long as your playing you get endless drinks.
50,Good location on strip. Hotel exceptionally clean. Room and casino very clean. Restaurants were very good. Nice selection to choose from. Pool excellent. A resort feel and very spacious swimming area. Never a issue finding a table game to play.
50,I enjoyed my stay sorry that it will be leaving for the Hard Rock.. it will be missed. I loved the pool nice size right temperature! Not to hot and not to cold.. the Oasis pool perfect temperature hands down. Great experience!!
10,In the fitness center 4 out of 8 treadmills and 2 out 5 cross-trainers were not working. The guest services representative at the desk's response was that they are serviced once a month. I also was unable to get my key card to open the parking gate at 3AM when I was leaving for my flight even though at check-in the key card was programmed to open the gate of the garage.
50,I have stayed at the Mirage on each of my 3 visits to Las Vegas and have never been disappointed. However there is now disappointment since the hotel has been sold to Hard Rock. I will be back in 2 years but will need to look for a new place to say.
50,The Hotel and staff were both excellent and we recommend our and family to go there. We would definitely go back there and visit next time. The rooms were clean the pool was the best food was best the show was great.
50,We stayed in the Stay Well room and it was great. The view was wonderful too. I got to watch the volcano erupt from the room.the strip was really pretty as well. We had a great time! Will definitely be back again next time.
30,The Mirage didn't disappoint- nor did it impress. The MGM app for check in alone is worth the install. The service was good clean hotel basic rooms weren't priced well or poorly. The resort fee returns it to 100/night room during the week. Be forewarned- your internet service at this property will be impressively poor. The pool is great with the falls and is very spacious with many different alcoves to lounge in. There is a neat bar in an oasis area - but now you are paying top dollar for your drinks which all of the same ones can be picked up wherever you go. The mirage has its shows and entertainment just like every other hotel. If you like to spend time in the canal shoppes and in this general area- the mirage is a decent value relative to other properties nearby.
40,The room was great staff was great but they gave us a room with a view of the roofAC units and trash on the roof from the second floor. Tried to get a new room but they said they had no other rooms except rooms that had similar views. Needless to say was disappointing to have that view.
40,We decided to get in one last visit at The Mirage before it was sold. We wanted one more day at the pool and one more weekend with this classic property. Things are still well maintained despite the pending takeover. Pool was a most excellent time. The room was a bit better than average for the Strip.
30,We wanted to stay at the Mirage one last time before it became the Hard Rock. We booked two rooms and both were a little rundown. The curtains were broken on one and the Wi-Fi didn’t work in the other. Overall the rooms felt old and dingy but weren’t terrible. The elevators had some kind of issue on our first 2 days and didn’t come when called making for long lines.    Bars on the casino floor could have had more options. I was hoping to get the tiki drink and commemorative mug on the website but the bartender said they don’t even have a drink menu anymore. The piano bar doesn’t have a piano anymore either. We enjoyed Rhumbar very much but didn’t like most of the other restaurant offerings.    Pool hours were too short and could have been open till 8. The Gym needed maintenance and a lot of machines were out of order or missing weight pins.    The volcano was great. I’ll miss it but It was pretty clear that the Mirage stopped being a high priority for MGM a while ago. We’ll stay at Mandalay Bay next time.
20,I love mgm properties but this stay definitely had some issues. their internet was absolutely horrendous! if you have to work from room I suggest DO NOT STAY HERE. I also noticed when using the bathroom a hair in the tub and a hair on the towel. which was gross! The staff was nice! I didn't have a problem with them but this hotel is lacking plenty.
50,Everything was exceptionally amazing from front desk. Everything was clean. Room service and house keeping were super friendly. Casinos were fun and people there helped me to get a players card and make some bets.
50,Although a short get-away from home but it was excellent and easy to stay at Mirage. We love it and hope we will have another chance to come back and enjoy again at Mirage to see friendly staff good food.
50,We had an amazing time for the Fourth of July weekend the amenities are great. The pool was amazing with the waterfalls and it was nice and cool unlike other pools were they are warm and not very pleasant on a hot day.
40,I wish the representative would have told me all about the hotel like amenities and what’s on the property during check in time. They have a nice pool that’s family friendly. Lots to do on the property including the secret garden and see dolphins!
50,You will not be disappointed at the mirage. Clean well kept establishment. Family friendly. So much to do just in the resort alone. I have stayed in many other hotels on and off the strip but this one is our favorite so far.
50,Always clean and decent return at casino (at least compared to the rest) but it's the people who work at the Mirage that bring us back again and again. They're the absolutely the best (compared to anyone!)
40,Great weekend!!!!!!!!!!! really enjoyed the pool can’t wait till next trip with my husband and family ………...had an amazing time with my husband relaxing and tanning at the pool ….already planning the next trip to Vegas
50,This pool is amazing one of the few with shade highly recommend renting chairs with umbrellas. Staff are super friendly every time housekeeping saw us they greeted us. Plenty of amazing food and snack choices.
50,We spent a week at the Mirage and enjoyed the pool very much. The proximity to Ceasars Belagio Venetian and the Ferris Wheel is ideal.  The employees at the Mirage were excellent. Friendly and engaged.
20,The housekeeping almost doesn’t exist mgm rewards wouldn’t comp me beyond the standard dinner despite platinum status and spending lot of $$. I think I’m going to stick to Aria. The main reason I picked mirage was for better comps won’t be making the same mistake again
50,I have been coming to this hotel since they opened and have always been very happy! From the staff to the cleanliness of the hotel it is wonderful. They have the best pool in Vegas hands down and is always a great time!
50,Check-in was easy with the mobile app. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Room was nice and clean. Housekeeping did a great job keeping the room clean. My daughter spilled some juice on the bed and they changed out our sheets for us!
50,Recently enjoyed 4 night stay in 2 bedroom tower suite. Really made our stay comfortable and had excellent view os the volcano and strip. Enjoyed the fast and friendly room service as well. Would enjoy going back for another stay
30,The atmosphere at the mirage is fantastic! The location right in the middle of the strip is perfect! The beds are comfortable the staff was friendly and the machines are fun! We also enjoyed breakfast and Pantry and the frozen yogurt is delicious!
40,Good location for experiencing the strip. Olivia at the concierge desk was fantastic. Gelato ice cream shop and staff was good. Best thing we did at the hotel was renting a cabana. Pool was amazing and had a great experience.
50,Love the mirage. Hotel is clean  people are so nice & fun. It’s not too big either. The overall experience is great .. And  You can’t beat the value. They actually make it worth while to become a rewards member as well.
50,Very clean. Had a volcano view room and the views of the strip were amazing. The pool is great with plenty of places to get shade. Splurge for the oasis pool if you can and request Seth as your attendant. He is the best!
20,"We were ""upgraded"" to a room that had a constant obnoxious noise. Ac was set at 69 but it would get much hotter than that very often. We were charged more for the upgrade than was originally quoted. Hot tubs are luke warm at best"
50,Great location! Amazing pool!! And the staff delivers exemplary service going out of their way to ensure your stay is perfect!    Be sure to visit Siegfried & Roy's Secret Garden & Dolphin Habitat for an up close and personal experience!
30,Advantages : Nice pool / Clean rooms / front fire show is a nice free 5min show / parking and onsite Avis rental are convenient    Disadvantages: See through toilet paper ! Fridge is a spending trap : do not touch anything inside … wifi is unreliable.
40,"I picked the ""Stay Well"" room not thinking it was anything different from the other rooms. Everything was good except the matress was very hard which made for not good sleep at all. Some of this was probably my fault for not reading the fine details but maybe it's something they could make a little more obvious from the booking site? Other than the matress everything else was great including the Beatles LOVE show. I intend to come back just to do this show again."
10,Rude guest services lied to us that our truck would fit in garage. Was forced to valet as oversized outside parking was insecure the security guard told us and oversized cost more than valet. Resulted in our truck roof being scuffed and scratched. Extremely rude guest services filthy rooms that were not cleaned had toenails popped tags food and trash on floor. Not vacuumed or mopped dirty shower and black mold. Broken toilet paper holder and shower head gross lube on headboards and face prints all over windows. Foggy water in pool was beyond gross. 45 minutes to get our truck out of valet. Couldn't wait to checkout of there.
50,My stay at the mirage was phenomenal. One of the best hotels that I’ve stayed at in Vegas. Housekeeping was amazing and ensured that the room was always clean and tidy. All the staff members at the hotel was friendly and willing to help. The mirage is an amazing hotel and in a great location.
50,Had a great stay. Clean and friendly staff. Great pool. Fun casino good restaurants and reasonably priced. Easy to get anywhere from there since it’s at the Center of the strip. Great air conditioning
50,Excellent location service ! Provides all the amenities needed in Las Vegas. We stay at The Mirage once or twice a year and they never disappoint. The staff is amazing the pool is perfect the food is exceptional. I will continue to always book my stay at The Mirage!!!
10,I stayed at Mirage for two days and the experience I had was terrible. The carpet in the room I stayed too old and it was falling apart. The tub was not draining properly. The exhust fan in the bathroom was too noisy. The ironing table was too dirty.
30,I was initially placed in a room that had not been cleaned since the last occupant - bed was unmade and restroom trash has not been taken out. Requested room change which was much better. The location on the strip was excellent.
30,Michaelmeservey my account communications specialist was no help to my problem. Told me 1 thing on the phone and when I showed up for check in it was the total opposite to what we had booked or reserved for
50,Great hotel. Wonderful friendly staff. Easy check in. Nice clean room. Housekeeping was great and helpful. Hotel has wonderful amenities. And smells amazing inside. Reasonable rates. I will be so sad to see it go.
30,Midweek prices are attractive but the rooms are outdated and small and pretty worn out. There are better hotels on the Strip that offer more. I didn't appreciate paying for parking. This property while located well on The Strip does not have the best restaurants/shopping to choose from.
50,The Mirage did not disappointment. We had the strip and volcano view which was nice. Comfortable beds were cleaned daily. The pool is amazing although closes too early I believe 7pm.  WARNING do not use the fridge even to cook your beverages purchased on the strip you will be charged simply by moving their items and adding yours without consumption. The front desk employee stating the hotel does not own these and a third party is responsible for stocking etc. Other than that our stay was great.
10,Rooms are atrocious staff is rude and overpriced. Chose another property for your stay. The only good experience we had was at California Pizza Kitchen for dinner. Everything about the experience was a disappointment!
50,When I found out The Mirage was sold to Hard Rock I knew we had to stay here (our first time) while we had a chance. This property has historical significance.    We had a great stay. The property is beautiful and well maintained. Our room had a view of the strip which was cool. Our room was comfy. Housekeeping was great.    My husband is temporarily in a wheelchair and everyone went above and beyond to help us navigate that.    I felt very safe at this property. I love that you had to use your room key in the elevator to get to your floor. We were playing in the casino one day and I witnessed security quietly but firmly ask someone to leave and they escorted them out the door.    If you love Vegas history I recommend you stay here while you still can.
40,Slot machines tight. Go across street to Harrahs …better gambling there. Staff friendly. Check in easy on app. Was allowed to get into room earlier than expected. Liked the scan code to join wait lists for restaurants. NEVER waited the time it stated…always much less. When checking out double check your receipt for parking charges. They charge in app. Our barcode did not work at gate. Had to pay again. Hotel refunded after 41 min wait on phone.
50,Everything was awesome and close to everything. Wish bed wasn't as hard but it's not something I would knock stars for. Definitely will recommend and come back! Everyone is friendly and willing to help!
50,Great for family. Perfect location in the center of the strip. Plenty of restaurants and friendly staff. Only complaint is it seems that there may not be sufficient staff to clean the rooms. We were out for several hours on a Saturday and our room never got cleaned.
40,Excellent service and very clean rooms and facilities!! The in-house restaurants are very goor and the atmosphere is very attractive - highly recommended. Great location on the strip but LV not a plcecfor kids.
10,Our stay started with a unclean room m not getting our mini fridge for medicine then being charged for others meals and then the embarrassing thing of bot being able to charge my food to room and having our friends pay our bill then having a dining experience charge those wrong bill n place their own tip to our room when we paid cash. We stayed a week due to a convention or would of left. I literally went hot cleaner n cleaned myself this was a horrible stay I should have not been chargef for
30,Was an enjoyable stay no major issues. Pool service was meh and we paid for the seats right by pool edge. Room was ok a bit smaller than what we are used to at the Venetian. Overall an ok place to stay
40,Mirage has always been one of my favourite LV hotels. Great location pool area sports book etc. On this visit the buffet and poker room were closed down and less table games than previous visits. It was obvious they are getting ready for the change-over to Hard Rock in the coming months. Enjoyed my stay but will probably wait until reviews start coming in after it becomes a Hard Rock property before I stay there again.
40,Clean hotel with great customer service. As with all of Vegas the price you pay isn't worth what you get. Food is mediocre at best. I booked a tower suite for my grandfather's birthday and was unable to use the refrigerator without an additional charge. No microwave in the suite to reheat leftover food. I feel like those to things are a common curiosity ESPECIALLY for a room that is $799/night. I will not be doing that again.
10,I am very much dissatisfied with the way i was treated my mirage manager. There was so many issue with the room. I requested so many time to change the room but manager didn't helped me to do so. I am very ever going to mirage again. Worst part was the manger of the property.
30,The hotel and casino are good but they should not charge for parking if you are a guest at their hotel. They already Charge you for the room and a “resort fee”.    MGM has gotten a little greedy over the past years.    We were also told they will not open the buffet anymore.
40,As you'd expect from hotels along the strip this hotel is big brash busy and full-on. Check in was fine but they sting you c.$45 for a 'resort fee' which is friggin' annoying when room is already pricey + parking. The room was modern and large and overlooked the volcano and strip. It's a bit of a schelp to the end of the strip and back but walking along and taking it all in is part of why you come to Vegas. There's a big loud pool area and gambling/retail galore. We had just the one night in Vegas and if you want to be part of it/make the most of your time then it's a decent place to stay.
30,"I frequent mgm properties and seeing as Mirage was sold I wanted to stay here before anything changes. First off the  Pros:  No lines at Check in  Plenty of food options  Location is as good as any(next door to Caesars.)  One of the best pools in town.  Wasn't as busy as other hotels.  The room I had was big for a standard room.    Cons:  Room was dirty.  Voiced my displeasure over a couple issues to the front desk and was told there's nothing they could do.  Front desk attendant was very rude and quick to dismiss any issues I had.  Was told by one attendant my resort fees would be removed and told something else by another. No communication (I was charged it still)  I asked for a different room and was told I could get a ""complimentary"" upgrade for just $100 more per night. The room was just a step above standard so I declined. My main reason for asking for another room was because the air-conditioner was barely working it was 110degrees outside.  I was given an email and told to contact them about my stay but hadn't done so as usually that just falls on deaf ears and won't accomplish anything.    Overall the hotel is nice and has alot to offer. The rooms are great aside from the toilets that sound like an airplane taking off and a/c that wasnt great. Pool is amazing the Beatles LOVE show is there. Didn't have any luck gambling there this time but there's plenty of slots and table games to play. Planning on giving this place another chance in August. But hopefully the room issues and more Importantly the rude employee issues will be fixed by then. Just because it was sold doesn't mean the standard of MGM properties has to change."
10,The evening is the best time to go swimming in vegas but they close well before sunset! No mini fridge? Is it 1986?What am I supposed to do with all my delicious leftovers? All other hotels have better amenities then this place and at better prices too. Puck a different hotel.
40,This was the first time to Vegas with our two children. They loved it. I’ve stayed at other resorts in Vegas and felt the rooms were outdated. Regardless my kids thought this was the most magical place
50,Had my bachelorette party here in June . I usually stay at the Wynn or Encore or Venetian but with friends I prefer a more laid back atmosphere Mirage has to offer. I have stayed here a few times also and have never been disappointed Amazing staff quick check-in amazing restaurants at all price points and great casino ! Only place within this hotel that needs some help is really starbucks. Other than that we ate breakfast and lunch and late night snacks at the hotel daily. All staff was amazing. I am so sad this resort will no longer be mirage and will now be Hardrock soon. When that happens I will not be back. They will not provide the same atmosphere . I will go back to the Wynn or Encore now no matter the type of trip. Mirage will be missed!
30,Everything was beautiful very clean staff was very helpful. Got in late and had to grab to go food when I made it to the room the fridge was LOCKED. When I called down stairs to get the code I was notified that the fridge cost $35 dollars per night! This is on top on the resort fees and all the other outrageous fees you have to pay.
10,The room was as expected. 3 night stay with only 1 day of housekeeping service. The hotel was clean and staff were pleasant. However the billing department I am not pleased. I paid $300 at the time I made the reservation. I was charged the remainder at check in as well as $100 a night for damage deposit. No damages to the room. After arriving home I was charged an additional $390 from my account. The only thing hotel can tell me is that the money must not have came out my account when I made the reservation when I know it did. I am very aware of how much I have and when and what is deducted from my account. I am very displeased with the outcome.
50,I loved this place was updated to a suite room for absolutely free!!!! No tax or resort fees either parking was also free!!!! The pool was nice and clean room was right next to food places and the parking garage
50,First time at the Mirage and I found the staff extremely helpful and pleasant. The room was a little dated looking but clean and comfortable. We were able to arrange two rooms close together so our daughter and SO we’re close but not too close!
50,Was an awesome hotel and casino rooms are very clean and great location to stay. Staff are amazing they helped and also look for the view you want to stay I highly recommend this hotel on the strip. Thanks
40,selected the hotel just for a pool beautiful pool. Wish there was direct access to the pool from the guest elevator rather than walking thro casino mainfloor smokey environment. Lots of secondhand smoke not really kids friendly.
50,This was my first time staying at The Mirage and it is a really nice hotel especially for the price! Me and my family members would stay here again! The Pantry restaurant is also really good!! We had a great time.
40,The Mirage is a great place to stay even if a little dated. The only drawback is that the pool is too busy or not big enough for all the people. Overall though the rooms are incredibly comfortable and in general it is the best smelling casino that exists!
50,When we checked in it was a breeze. Our hotel room was very nice and comfortable and even had a great view we went downstairs to play some slots and the casino was very clean and inviting when it came down to eating the pantry and el Diablo were great will definitely be back for some more fun
50,My husband and I stayed here over the Bellagio due to finding out the soon to be fate of The Mirage. We found ourselves pleasantly surprised with the beauty and Vegas charm at The Mirage. Our favorite was the day at the pool. It was beautiful relaxing and provided a great getaway experience.
30,We loved the location of the Mirage and the girl that checked us in was awesome but for the price we paid there was hair on the back of the bathroom door and the shower curtain either needed cleaned or they used a dirty rag or mop to clean the bathroom.
30,I entered many casinos on my trip and The Mirage was by far the most foul smelling. You can smell the cigarettes right before you enter the main doors. It’s very disappointing because amenity-wise this casino is the most family friendly but you have to grapple with the idea of your kids inhaling and stinking of cigarette smoke.  I explored 3 star early 80s casinos that had less of an odor. I sat at other MGM casino slots next to smokers and couldn’t even smell the cigarette. Maybe they care less now that the casino is going to become a Hard Rock.
50,We always enjoy our stay here! We are so sad that they sold to Hard Rock.. there’s so much to do inside the hotel even with kids! Between all the restaurants Beatles LOVE the Secret Garden w/white tigers leopards lions and dolphins. We really enjoyed our stay and will miss it so much when it’s gone!!
40,I entered many casinos from 3 star early 80s casinos to 5 star modern casinos on my trip and the mirage was by far the most foul smelling. It’s a shame because amenity-wise it’s the most family friendly. You smell the cigarettes before entering the main doors. Other MGM properties you can sit next to a smoker at the slots and not even smell their cigarette.
50,Excellent value for what you get pool was very clean always enough staff to help out  restaurants were clean and service levels very good .  Will be back very soon I miss it already  all our friends talked highly of the service in our trip
50,My go to whenever in Vegas. The people are great rooms always clean and up to date. Location of everything inside is just right. Is centrally located in the middle of strip. Can’t go wrong with this resort.
10,Undisclosed resort fees tax on undisclosed resort fees. Overcharged at checkout. Room bathroom facilities worn shoddily repaired toilet had trouble flushing - felt like a Motel 6. Overpriced amenities. Don’t eat/drink in-room offerings. $10 bottled water $10 Pringles chips $7.50 M&Ms. Price gouging.
50,The location of this hotel is perfect in the middle of all prime attractions. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The building and the rooms are very clean and the beds very comfortable. The pool is mind blowing and very roomy.
50,"The hotel was very nice and very relaxing. I would definitely stay there again. Next time I would just confirm ""the upgrade"" since our upgrade was more of a downgrade. The pool was small for all of the people staying there and not enough shade for such a hot place but it was still very nice. A good place for the family to vacation."
50,This hotel casino and resort was just as we expected. It was very clean and smelled great. Could not smell cigarette smoke even though smoking is aloud. Darius our check-in staff could not have been more friendly and was extremely helpful when we requested an upgrade. Thank you Darius. We also had the pleasure of a waitress Janel during breakfast. She also was super friendly and very efficient. Our room was superb and cleaning was done efficiently and quickly each day. I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Vegas.
20,The resort fees are cuh-razy high ($275 per day…NOT the ROOM fee). The location on the strip was okay but the room itself was quite disappointing. I’ve experienced better rooms at Best Western. There was smeared excrement in the bathtub when we arrived.
50,Outstanding staff. Amazing restaurants and bars! Music shows shopping... friendly slots and tables. You will feel like a prized customer. It does not get better than this! Not so oversized like most casinos. You will not want to leave!
50,Stayed at the Mirage one last time had a great time with a lovely room. Will be such a loss on e it is gone as there are always available restaurants and shows to see here. I can only hope the next hotel can do it justice.
40,The room was very nice. We had a great view of the strip but please explain how the resort fee benefits me?? Not even a free bottle of water! However a fully stocked fridge with no room to place personal drinks.
50,Was a great and fun trip! Service was great hotel casino was great. Pool restaurants and downstairs dancing were our favorite part! Stacks restaurant has AMAZING food. Would love to come back in the future definitely.
20,The Mirage has become the Walmart of hotels in Vegas. If you don’t like good food and you don’t mind smelling like an ashtray you’re good. I guess you get what you pay for. I won’t be back. Most of the restaurants were closed and very limited in room dining. Basically they hand you a togo bag at your door. No carts or trays. Just plastic forks and cold expensive food.
10,"Upon arrival Crystal checked us in she didn't greet us or smile she was terrible. She then informed me that even though I had a booked the very expensive two bedroom tower suite months ago I could not get ANY view. We were getting the crappy ""mountain view"" which is actually the view of a huge roof. She could have cared less she didn't apologize or offer any amnesties to make up for it a free breakfast would have been nice. She should not be at the front desk. Horrible first impression. Then the room was terrible. At 1:30AM my son left his bedroom into the attached kitchen his door closed behind him and LOCKED HIM OUT. We could also not get the keys to let us enter from the hallway. It took 40 minutes and THREE security guys to open the door. We were told the interior door locks because it's ""an old door"" and sometimes the lock engages when the door closes. REALLY? This is what I paid $3500 for??? Alsothe suite had no Kleenex and the makeup mirror didn't work. Terrible experience."
40,Haven't been to Las Vegas for work in a long time. Mirage was great. Clean room great staff and excellent business center. The Business Center went above and beyond with assisting with our packages. Happy to be back in Las Vegas.
50,The Mirage was a fantastic place to stay! My 86 year old mom and I were there for my nephew’s wedding and I was very concerned how we would get around since she cannot walk long distances. We were able to rent a wheel chair which worked out for us.The rooms were clean and if you needed anything it was a phone call away! There are restaurants and shopping available which was so convenient for us. There are also scooters available. If you do decide to rent a scooter at the front desk make sure you check the setting. Ours was cranked up to the highest speed when we got it. Once we figured out the speed settings my mom was too afraid to use it so we used a wheelchair instead which worked out just fine for us!:). I also felt very safe and secure here. There is security monitoring the property which is comforting especially when you are in an unfamiliar place. I will definitely come back and stay at the Mirage!
20,"We $700/night for a suite. Arrived to a dirty room with clogged bathroom sinks dirty leftovers towels left behind and hair in the tub. When we complained we were moved to a handicapped room of lesser quality. This room was also dirty and the shower was 2'x2'. My son who is 6'6"" couldn't even fit into the shower. We should have been moved to a suite that was of equal value that I paid for NOT a handicapped room. The front desk lady that ""helped"" me was very impatient and rude. We did not get what we expected or paid for. Very disappointed and would not recommend staying at this resort."
30,Like everything in Las Vegas the room was expensive and didn't deliver anything extra for the cost not even A/C or a bath tub that would drain properly. The hotel its self was nice and the staff were friendly but the room was a disappointment.
50,I arrived at the Mirage around 8:30am and needed somewhere to work on my laptop since check in wasn't for quite a few hours. They allowed me to check in right then without any early check in charge. Everyone was very helpful.
40,my wife and I celebrated my birthday in Vegas last week mostly because we just wanted to do a cheap get away and keep it close (from Phoenix). some good things were that many of the buffets were operating although just as many have yet to reopen after the covid crisis. the mirage despite just announcing a changeover to hard rock was pretty spotless and showed no signs of the imminent change over. what disgusted me was the increased number of drunks crackheads and such simply lying across the paths of all the tourist traffic. they have always been there but it seemed more blatant on this trip. I cant imagine bringing any children here where a family would have to step over a passed out bum or walk around a sprawled out individual smoking crack out of a dr. pepper can. i'm not sure what the answer is but unless there was a special concert I had to see I don't see us returning any time soon for any extended period. get in and get out would be our plan going forward. too bad.
50,The stay at the mirage was nothing but amazing. My only tip would be that valet is expensive so I did not di valet I usually do but for $30 bucks a night for guest staying there as well I preferred to try the self parking for $15 a night and the parking structure lead you right into the lobby so it wasn’t much of a walk.
20,Really bad customer service. Air didn’t work in my room and I called multiple times and no one ever came to fix it. Loved the check In process though. The MGM app is really great and i loved that I didn’t have to wait in any lines to check in
50,The pool area is really nice but it was really crowded. But with a little bit of walking around we finally found a spot to enjoy the pool. Also the number of restaurants close by make it easy to find some place to eat.
50,The location was perfect; it was within walking distance of many attractions. Plus it has its own attractions. Great rooms good eating places and helpful staff. We would very definitely stay there again.
30,"For $200+ a night you will not have complimentary coffee in your room. Even the cheapest hotels that I have stayed in I have always had coffee in my room. Not here. You have to walk literally to the other side of the hotel to Starbucks for the nearest coffee unless you want to sit at a restaurant and wait 45 minutes. We had paint pealing off the walls in the room and a funky smell. If you make a reservation at one of the hotel restaurants like The Still or The Pantry still expect to wait in line for over an hour. However the Sigfried and Roy Dolphin Experience is worth every penny. The pool is also amazing but I recommend getting a cabana because the chairs fill up quickly. They also do not tell you about the additional $100 a night they automatically take out of your account in case you order room service or take snacks or use the mini bar. Speaking of mini bar. It's weight sensored. If u pick up a drink and put it back it will charge ur card TWICE. You also cannot use the fridge for personal use because again if you add weight it will charge you. Oh and none of the vending machines on our floor worked. They had drinks in them but would say ""sold out""."
10,We stayed at The Mirage because we were seeing a show at their theater. Upon entry the room was dirty. The headboard was greasy with handprints there was food on the floor the tub was dirty - among other things. The walls are PAPER thin and it was just overall - a well below average visit. Additionally they can be really expensive! They’ve recently been bought and it almost seems they’ve simply given up.
40,Resort fees are ridiculous. Pay all that money for a room and added resort fees seem to get more and more expensive. I know every casino does it and it’s way too much after paying for the rooms in general.
50,We had such a great time this past weekend at the Mirage. We were pampered by the staff all weekend and had a reasonable priced clean room in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip. We really hate to see this hotel go.
40,This hotel was really cool. The theming is awesome including the oasis style pool. Plenty of shops and restaurants/bars to choose from. The resort fee is only $45 per day not too bad. My biggest gripes were the $100 deposit PER DAY and not being able to use the in room fridge without paying a $50 restocking fee. The app was unreliable so while having digital keys was convenient and made check in a breeze we ended up having to go to the counter anyways to get physical keys.
50,Stayed at the Mirage from June 19th to June 24th. Great experience. Pool area very well maintained and staff. Staff very courteous and helpful throughout the trip. Rooms were well designed and strip view rooms were great for seeing the volcano show and the Linq Wheel and down the strip. Definitely would stay again.
30,Plumbing needs an update as the room above us had a sewage leak in to our room. Had to change rooms but front desk couldn’t tell us if or when they would have a comparable room for us to move in to so we lost a day of activity. Lights burnt out in the new room as well.
50,Stayed a whole week for a dance competition. The staff provided incredible service. Made me asked myself why haven’t I stay at the mirage more often. From the pool cabana service to front desk. Very welcoming.
30,The room was clean and fine. Hate smoky buildings. The elevator was always congested. Bad service and check in and check out. Messed up my reservations then turned my room key off a day early. Nobody went out of their way to make up for my inconvenience.
50,Nice place to stay. Eating places in the mirage were very expensive. Location was great. Getting your valet parked vehicle was timely. Resort fee here was cheaper than at some of the other hotels. Nice place to stay
30,The room was very clean and very comfortable. There was easy access to the casino and the pool. Though the hallway to the room was very cold the room temperature wise easily controlled. There were many restaurants offering great choices. I have 3 out of 5 because I was unable to rent an umbrella for that same day then there were many unused umbrellas at the pool. At one point my sister’s card wouldn’t open the room so I called the desk and they said they would send someone. Fifteen minutes later I called again still no one came. Called a third time and he told me we’d have to come to the desk to get the card. Sister found security herself who let her in the room. Irritating. But overall we had a wonderful time.
20,Surprisingly the Mirage has been kept clean and nice even though it’s been awhile since it’s last remodel. Unfortunately the AC in our room was only partly working. We called maintenance twice. The first time I was there and a dirty filter was replaced. The second time I wasn’t and nothing changed. Every time we entered the room it was very stuffy—a full 8 degrees minimum warmer than the hallway. I could have lived with this if the room had ever gotten cold while we were inside. It did not. When the AC is set at 65 and it’s still too hot to use the minimal blankets/sheets provided something is wrong. I even recorded a sound that the AC would make on occasion—which is probably why the room wouldn’t get cold. Fix it.
40,Except for the high resort and parking fees the Mirage is a beautiful property and in my opinion in the perfect location on the Las Vegas strip between Treasure Island and Caesars Palace and across the street from the Venetian Palazzo Casino Royale Harrah's Linq and Flamingp. I had a Resorts Tower King on the 28th floor with a Volcano view.
50,This is the only hotel I stay at for many reasons. The location is perfect and it has a great pool. For breakfast The Pantry has great food and they are so quick. Late night drinks at the Rhumbar were spectacular. They also have a 24 hour store with everything you need after a long night of drinking.
30,Hotel is located right in the sweet spot on the strip. The room wasn’t horrible but in desperate need of a renovation. And do not pay for the strip view rooms as you will get a pool view with a view of Cesar’s palace mechanical buildings.
50,If you prefer the smaller more personal hotel than this is for you!! Great rooms pool and restaurants!! Location is the best!! We have been staying here for over 15 years it is the best you will not be disappointed!!
30,Hotel and most accommodations are great. Bath tub drain did not work. Water would pool in the tub. It took it upon myself to pull previous hair out of the bathtub drain. Then the drain worked better Phone kept ringing in the middle of the night. Only static on the other end. Not a nice peaceful journey
10,Terrible customer service and disgusting food at the still bar. Room wasn’t properly cleaned. Very out dated hotel room toilet had issues flushing. The bath tub took a long time to drain and sink as well.
30,They use every trick possible to try and get your money. Rooms are nice but very few towel bars and no nightlight in bathroom. Have to walk a long way from check in the elevator mini bar a ripoff- I was charged for a Diet Coke which I simply moved back a few inches.
50,We enjoyed our stay at Mirage for the second straight year. The property is beautiful. It will be a shame to see it change in any way. The staff members are pretty amazing and very helpful! We enjoyed our time in the pool as well.
10,I had an issue at the pool Carolina your employee threw away my daughter hat . I had towel and chairs saved while my daughters are in the pool and Carolina took the towels out of the chair and clear the chairs out . I told her my kids are inside the pool and she said they the mirage has an hour policy I had to go then get my kids out the pool and show staff we had four people in our party . Management did nothing !!
50,Maybe I am old school but no matter how many hotels I have stayed at i always tend to go back to the Mirage whenever I can. Maybe because I made some great memories here my friends and I were younger and this was our first hotel we ever stayed at in Las Vegas.
40,We got comped rooms here through our MGM Rewards. We were a bit reluctant to stay here as we normally stay at Delano or Mandalay Bay because their rooms and property are modern and very clean. We stayed here because our room was comped and were very surprised how clean and well kept the property was. The hotel rooms could use new beds but other than that it was fine.
50,Friendly staff great food and location location location. I've stayed here on my last 4 trips and have found it to be the place to be. game room is nice and the tables are affordable $15.00. The pool was also very nice as you can hide from the sun under the waterfall. I'll be back!
50,Id like to start off by saying this was my first time at the Mirage and I was impressed at how spotless everything was.  Our experience from arrival was amazing everyone was super friendly and helpful.  Room was impeccable bot one spec of dirt we will definitely be staying there whenever we visit Las Vegas.
50,My husband and I go to Vegas about 2x's a year. We have stayed at several different hotels on the strip but the Mirage has been my favorite. Our host is so accommodating and the tower suite we get is absolutely beautiful. The staff is amazing and it's very clean. Love the Italian restaurant (well all of them are great) the pool is perfect and the grounds are beautiful. Going back in August : )
50,Everything was great! Clean and comfortable room. Service was great. The only thing that could be better was if there was a refrigerator and microwave in the room. I have a low blood sugar issue and need to have snacks and drinks.
50,Please understand I am writing this review based on Vegas experiences and expectations. If I were comparing The Mirage to hotels in other cities it would be no higher than 3 stars but things work differently in Vegas.    First the location is perfect! Right at mid-strip. The resort is beautiful. The casino area is vibrant and busy. You can catch a taxi right out front! Rideshare also! (But from a different pickup spot)    Our room was comfortable. The bed was great! Room was clean. The biggest complaints I have are lack of amenities and the ridiculously overpriced wet bar and snacks in the room. No refrigerator. No microwave. No coffee pot. No......nothing really. That is by design and typical for Vegas so no star deduction but I would be remiss if I did not mention how much it annoys me. There is a frig in the room but it is not for customer use. It is for way overpriced drinks. Of course we are Vegas veterans and know to not touch anything! Still the fact the hotel is attempting to financially rob its customers with these tactics is annoying and frustrating. But again....typical Vegas so no deduction.    The housekeeping staff was the friendliest and most polite we have ever encountered at any hotel anywhere.    Complaints aside we loved our stay at the Mirage. We loved the volcano and other attractions. We LOVED the amazing pool. Huge and beautiful. It is really sad this hotel is scheduled to be partially torn down and changed into something else by new owners. We would love to stau here again but likely will not get a chance.
50,Love the hotel very accommodating you will see me back there soon. Clean rooms Bell desk people very helpful. Valet parking Was awesome . The bell boys took my stuff to my stuff up to my room promptling All in all I would recommend everyone to go to this hotel
50,The Mirage was excellent The rewards perk saved me money on the rooms. The staff is inviting. The rooms are super clean and comfy. The pool is awesome but mainly the location is great. We didn't eat here but the Starbucks was a plus and Gelato a huge hit
30,Overall a decent hotel with a few good restaurants/eateries. Hotel did feel a little old and worn but everything was very clean. Rooms had tiny bathrooms and were slightly noisy. There must have been minimal insulation to help prevent disturbances by neighbors and hallway noise. Pool was too cold to enjoy (even in 100+ degree heat) but the two big hot tubs made up for that. Warning...do not leave anything at your pool chair for any amount of time. The staff will clean it up...cell phone hat shirt and anything else. They don't even check to see if anything is inside the towels they just dump your stuff. I was away from my chair and towel for about 15 minutes. Their policy says 1 hour and they will clean it up. Pool staff at least check if there is somebody's stuff there. Minus 1 star for that horrible experience. Luckily I was able to track my phone which forced them to actually look and find my items. Great location on the strip with easy self-parking and check-in.
20,"had some friends staying at the Mirage for their 25th anniversary. so my wife and i thought it would be nice to send them a bottle of champagne and some chocolate covered strawberries.  called the concierge folks who handled everything. they were great. super professional and super helpful.  here's the problem -- their web page said the champagne i wanted to send was $130 a bottle. when i ordered they told me it would be $200 -- for a bottle i can get for $50 at the liquor store around the corner from my house.  the chocolate covered strawberries that the web page said were $25 turned out to be $49. i wasn't crazy about the discrepancy but i thought what the heck. i could order and be done. i'm 1500 miles from Las Vegas and it was a special occasion for some special friends.  well the $249 turned out to be $312 by the time the charge showed up on my card. vague fees i was never told about were added it seems.  the card they delivered to the room with the gift just said ""happy anniversary"" without our names (as I'd asked them to put on the card) or the wishes for 25 more. so our friends thought this nice bottle of champagne strawberries and the card were a gift from the hotel since when they booked they told the Mirage it was an anniversary trip.  to add insult to injury later i found a business in Vegas that does the same thing and delivers to all hotels on the strip. would have cost about half."
50,We love the Mirage! The location can't be beat. The property is beautiful and the pool is truly an oasis! The only glitch was the ac. I guess the room is eco friendly. The ac doesn't cool when you are not in the room. On our 3rd night we called the front desk to complain. It turns out the room thinks you are leaving if you come back and shut the door but don't use the deadbolt. So everytime you return to your room you must use the deadbolt if you want the ac to cool. I just wish someone had told us this when we checked in. We had 2 miserable nights before figuring this out!
30,This hotel and casino is not up to par and should not be compared to the Venetian hotel and casino or the Cesar’s palace hotel and casino or the palazzo hotel and casino. Service was unexceptable at the mirage. From staff at the hotel being unacommadating and waitress’s and staff were very hard to find. Like seldom.
40,We were staying here for our honeymoon/birthday celebration as a first stop before heading else where for the week we were set to be on the 3rd floor but when arrived we were accommodated to the 20th with a nicer view which was really nice of the front desk clerk. The room was nice and had comfortable beds. The only down falls I think were the fact that there was no mini fridge other the one and it’s full of their “refreshments” at a charge. We had restaurant left overs and cake for my wife’s birthday that we couldn’t properly refrigerate. Also the door to the bathroom was way to close to the toilet when opened. My wife had reached to grab something while I was doing my business (as all long term couples do) and almost smacked me lol. Other than that it was a nice stay for an ok price.
40,This trip was 8 days combined with business and personal. We celebrated our 35th anniversary by book-ending a business conference I was attending. Very friendly staff and accommodating. Issues with the room but we adjusted. Really enjoy Heritage Steak!! We come every year and that restaurant serves as our anniversary dinner.
50,It was a short trip with the ladies but overall we all had fun . But some of the downfall was waiting too long to get waitress for our drinks while playing slots  some of them just walked by without asking us if we wanted drinks .. there were couple ladies that was good at bellagio.
10,Great location however the shower didn't drain the AC didn't work and there was a nasty stain on the sheets. Pool was freezing. We wanted to stay at the Mirage since it will be closing...wish we never did
30,Times are changing with the MGM resort is being sold to the Hard Rock group. There is no new money being invested and it seems like the Mirage is already in the change over/ being sold mode as there is a very limited selection of machines to play.
40,The location is great not too crazy of an area but great to get anywhere you want to.  Staff are friendly check in and check out were very easy.  The rooms were clean.  I would like to see maybe one more restaurant for breakfast or brunch.
40,Nice property. Check in was quick and easy. Was able to check in hours earlier. The bathroom is very small and tight. Toilet is extremely close to the door and very low to the ground. Cafes had reasonable prices and the food was good
30,"My family and I choose this hotel last minute we had been driving for 7 hours and needed a place to sleep check in was fast and easy we got our room key and headed up to the room when we got there we just set our things down we were so tired that we didn't notice right away but the room was really dusty and there were water stains on the celling there was black stains on the box string of the bed not sure what that was from housekeeping came in the next morning and ""cleaned"" but everything was still the same even the stains on the sheets my toddler made with his shoes were there even trying to take a shower was a hassle the water was either too hot or too cold I had to play with the handle for 10 minutes to get it just right the only good thing was the location right on the strip overall it could have been better for what we paid for"
50,Love the Mirage. I only stay here when in Vegas. Rooms are large and spacious. Food is excellent. Front desk was so helpful with check-in. Would highly recommend this hotel. Centrally located to the Strip
50,Best resort in Vegas perfect location right in the middle of the strip. Great vibe and amazing pool. Tons of stuff to do and plenty of places to eat. Love the rhum bar. Really chill vibe. We have been here 4 times now
50,Was our first trip to Las Vegas and we decided to celebrate our 20th year wedding anniversary and picked the Mirage due to location and recommendation from family and friends. We were not disappointed.
40,I enjoyed my stay at the Mirage the staff were helpful when I ask questions and the bed was very comfortable pillows were the best ever. Will definitely stay there again. Preferably on a higher floor than the second floor
10,Been to Vegas 20 times. BY FAR WORST TRIP !!!!!!!!!! I’m a higher tier rewards member It was my anniversary they promised amazing upgrades and failed at everything !!!! Dealers were awful! Constantly messing up and than would make snarky remarks like don’t play than. Weird cause you people playing to stay in business. NO POINT WAS IT A GOOD TRIP. PLEASE STAY AWAY
50,Great location and venue for families traveling to Las Vegas. Not inexpensive but not unaffordable. Good value for the price point. This is a very well kept property with very attentive and friendly staff. Super concierge desk. Shin Lim and Colin McCloud show is fantastic.
50,We enjoyed staying at the Mirage. Nice hotel. This was our first time. We would diffidently stay again. We usually stay one night on strip and a couple downtown. Remember not to touch anything on the sensor in the room. We were told not to and of course husband had to pick up a charger set. It went on room bill but was fixed by the front desk.
30,During our stay an employee entered our room. Allegedly we had called and asked for clarification on a room charge. We didn’t and even if we did that’s a phone call issue not a enter our hotel room issue.
50,Was in and out for a one night rewards stay easy arrival and check out. Would most definitely be recommending this place to anyone that asks. Clean rooms and well stocked fridge only quality products like Fiji water so no complaints from myself.
20,The check in service was good but the room definitely left a lot to be desired. The bathroom was very outdated and the room furnishings were very scratched and beat up. The floors were filthy like they hadn’t been vacuumed.
50,This was a very central place to stay while in Las Vegas Nevada. Gaming was fun for adults and the on site shows and amenities were great the kids to see. Staff and everyone was pleasant to deal with.
40,Great location for the Vegas shopping experience. Central to LV strip making  UBER trips simple. Great pool and hotel guest services! Beds aren’t great and rooms are a bit dated. Great diverse restaurant selection.
20,The room at this hotel did not have several basic hotel room amenities: no refrigerator no microwave and no coffee maker. It is doubtful that I will ever stay here again. Perhaps they will do better under new management.
50,Have stayed at many strip hotel/casinos but always return to The Mirage. Wife loves pool have had great rooms excellent service and food is top-notch. Good casino games. Everything is clean and well maintained.
50,The room was very spacious clean and modern. TV was super big and the toiletries were high end. Check-in was seamless. Arrived at 8am so room was not ready but I stored our luggage and got a text when my room was ready and luggage was sent to my room. Rooms were cleaned everyday and the whole staff was friendly.
20,Thought it would be a cool place to spend my birthday but it's very small and the hotel room I received faced a roof. The bed felt very hard and the toiletries were rough on my skin. It was a birthday trip that didn't feel as luxurious as I would have liked because the room wasn't comfortable.
10,As other reviewers have stated hotel is in poor condition and rooms are minimally maintained. Hotel staff was not accommodating and didn’t listen to complaints. It’s a good thing this place is sold to Hard Rock hopefully they do something with it for the better
50,Great stay at the Mirage. Rooms are nice. Lots of great restaurants on the property. Something for everyone. Lots of amenities. Pool is huge and very relaxing with cool waterfalls. Mirage is on the strip and close to everything
50,Took my mom to Vegas for her birthday. We had a great trip. Mirage is clean friendly and close to everything. They even clean your room daily unlike most hotels now days. Lots of food options awesome pool.
20,This hotel has given up and it shows. From check in to the tired rooms to the casino- The Mirage is a has been. The location is the only saving Grace for this once great hotel. My stay was anything but great.
50,Great location and the best pool on The Strip. Dining options are good (not great). Overall size of the facility is perfect. Rooms can use some updating but nothing major. Will stay here anytime I’m in Vegas.
50,Did a two night stay after three night at the Bellagio. We used mobile check in and received our room at 11:00 am. Original room was on the 7th floor looking at TI from. The floor plan. Decided to go to the front desk before goin got our room to ask about an upgrade. For a $100 minus all the fees we got a one bedroom suite overlooking the pool and strip on the 27th floor. Had an absolute blast at this resort. Went to the Beatles Love show and Shin Lim. Ate at Costa and Heritage both were fantastic. Pool was amazing was amazing. Casino was lively with good music playing. You can’t go wrong with this resort. It is for everyone from couples families young or old. Highly recommend staying here.
50,Haven’t stayed at Mirage for more than a decade but glad I got the opportunity again before it gets torn down. No better location on the strip and it still has the classic Vegas feel it had when it was first built. Service was friendly dining choices were great and the rooms were comfortable. Couldn’t ask for more.
50,We had a blast rooms were clean staff was nice and we were very well taken care of for our honeymoon. The Beatles Love show was a blast as well. Sad to see it go to the Hard Rock but we will try another MGM property soon
50,Great location on the strip. Rooms clean and comfy. Casino is spacious. The food at the restaurants was great. We tried the steak house and the bar n grill. It was great. They have the fire show outside at night. It gets hot but awesome to see
30,The hotel is conveniently in the middle of the strip. We were on the 24th floor and appreciated having elevators that services 2 floors only! The rooms weren’t super clean but clean enough considering the amount of rooms. There was only food on the floor near the bed in our room before we switched to another. Also consider “requesting” a certain bed size upon booking is not always honored due to availability.
40,The tropical feel of the casino and pool is awesome! So sad it may be going away when the Hard Rock takes over. Beware if using online check-in. We had 3 rooms in our party and all three rooms were placed on different floors using online check-in.Your room key only lets you access your floor. So we had to constantly meet in the lobby to go to each other’s rooms. Rooms are inconsistent in quality. One room was awesome. The other two had issues. One had a strong mildew smell and the other had night stand drawer’s my that would not stay closed. They literally would pop open the second you closed them. Got up in the middle of the night to use the restroom and got jabbed in the leg by a corner of the drawer that opened.Magnifying make up mirror had been removed in that room but not the others. Buffet is closed but the restaurants had good food. The days of cheap food in Vegas are long gone. Be prepared to spend a minimum of $20 pp on any meal. Overall we like the atmosphere of the casino and pool better than most on the strip. Can’t beat the tropical feel.
30,Let me start off by saying the staff & place beautiful. However just upkeeping was not at best window couldn't shut or seal since it was windy it made nose all night couldn't sleep. After two phone calls maintenance finally came. Pretty much told me they would have to put padding but they don't have any at the time. They couldn't move me to require a room and not to mention the lights were not working. That got fixed after 12 hours though.. I really don't have any bad experiences and it's not pressing but sleep was not good
50,First time visiting Las Vegas! The Mirage was at a perfect location on the LV strip! Rooms are renovated great size and very clean. Plenty to do at the hotel as well as checking out other hotels and casinos nearby. Only downfall was not able to use the mini fridge for personal items. Highly recommend staying at the Mirage!
10,Room not satisfactory old outdated. No plug in for phone that was convinent. No hair drier chairs nasty. Rooms to small looking at air conditioner units. Bathroom too small no room for two people to share.
50,The mirage is a very nice hotel I had a good time being there my only problem was the resort fees being so expensive and specially for every night there. I would of like to stay longer but i couldn’t pay so much.
30,The hotel rooms are outdated and needs major renovation. Plumbing issue with the bath tub not draining. Housekeeping didn't show up 1st day. Called every day to remind them. Pool area was dirty and not enough chairs and no shade area unless you pay $200 a day for a chair and umbrella. People smoking in places where they aren't allowed to smoke
50,Overall excellent experience at this property for it's age! Clean Stay Well Room is excellent ease of Digital check/in casino has plenty of selection and tables multiple Pools and an Adult Pool with Cabanas which we rented Cabana Girls excellent staff multiple restuarant choices!
10,The specific room reserved was not honored due to maintenance issues and rooms being put out of service. The overall quality of the resort is subpar. The Mirage is very very tired. The restaurants offer little of a refined experience. The ice machines were broken etc.
40,I enjoy my stay up to the point my purse was taken. I really enjoyed the pool bar. I didn’t get an opportunity to try any of the restaurants. The room was good and the bed was very comfortable. I only interacted with the security staff unfortunately.
50,Spa services were incredible. Service and cleanliness throughout the resort were great. The pool was awesome and our servers were all great! The slot machines were very tight but we viewed money spent as entertainment and it was still  So much fun!
50,Stay at Mirage 4x/yr (Ok I was there 3x in the last month bc I live in permanent winter). I've been to most pools on the strip and Mirage's pool is hands down the best if you're a sun lover. Pool gets sun all day is kept clean and cold (cannot say that for the other hotels on the strip) and the staff are excellent. The guests are friendly and it's a laid back atmosphere compared to other pools. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Rooms are not as posh as Aria or Encore but who spends time in their room in Vegas? My biggest gripe is you cannot rent single padded chairs. 1st world single problems I suppose.
30,It was a great location however the bathroom drains were clogged. The bathroom was not thoroughly cleaned upon check-in. There was a blood spot on our comforter. The guests next to us were very loud and the walls Our MGM rewards card did not work on all the slots.
50,Epic last stay at Mirage. Been coming for over 20 years. The fragrant air palm trees lions suites pool staff restaurants and all amenities. Spent quality time with friends new and old. It will be missed!
40,Very nice place. Staff is exceptional. Only complaint would be they have “eco-flush” toilets that do not flush well. Have stayed here several times and always very satisfied. Get a Volcano view room. It’s worth it.
50,Being an old hotel and casino we didn’t expect the facilities be so nice and clean. Mirage is centrally located on the strip and in walking distance to some of the biggest attractions casinos and fine restaurants in Las Vegas.
50,We loved staying at the Mirage! The room was very clean - the towels were soft shampoo/lotion high quality. The views of the pool and dolphin exhibit were grand. Every staff member we interacted with was friendly and professional. We’ll be back!
40,I understand the Mirage will become the Hard Rock & construction is to begin later this year. I'd wait. The rooms are tired....but the staff is great.  Be certain to have dinner at Otoro...DELICIOUS! Not overly pricey and worth every cent!
50,We stayed for two nights and honestly I chose this hotel because we had tickets to see the Beatles Love show so I thought it would make it easy. I've stayed in several Vegas strip hotels but never this one. We were very pleased. We don't gamble but the food at several of the restaurants was great - especially the street tacos in the sports bar who knew?? We loved the quiet bar in the lobby for a nightcap and the pool was fantastic. Next time we'll come back and plan to spend a whole day just there. It's also a good location on the strip to go walk and explore. And the bed was super comfortable. We definitely plan to return - I feel it was a great experience for the money.
50,Beautiful hotel great location and service. Glad I got to experience it before it’s gone. Wish I would’ve had more time to walk through the property and see the pool as I’ve heard the pool is amazing! Loved visiting the Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat.
50,Room cleanliness was exceptional as was service by all staff we encountered. The general vibe of the resort made this a welcoming experience. We would recommend this hotel as it is close to all the amenities anyone could want for a fullsome Vegas experience.
50,Beautiful rainforest to gamble in! Amazing food! Gorgeous pools! Wonderful shopping! Spectacular staff! Had a wonderful Girls Trip in the middle of paradise! We love Mirage! It’s our home away from home!
50,We have such a great time at this casino. Lots to do like swim sit poolside gamble many dining options and the staff is super friendly. We've stayed at other casinos and they were fine but the Mirage is in the perfect spot and many places within walking distance to enjoy as well.
50,We decided to stay at the Mirage before they build the new Hard Rock establishment. The location was perfect. The view was exquisite. The staff was friendly. I love tue big aquarium by the frontdesk. Hopefully they will keep the tank and the fishes. I am looking forward for another stay soon.
10,Not even a complementary bottle of water was in the room much less a small coffee pot with complementary coffee or tea. The vending machine with cokes and water never functioned in the four days that we were there. Room service only offered a minimum of a quart of coffee instead of 2 cups….. We will not return to the Mirage. The Venetian offered many more amenities for the price.
50,I really enjoyed the Mirage. The room was relaxing. I love the bathroom. It has a shower & tub ( separate). The pool was amazing. It is beautiful. The property has lots of shops Starbucks & places like that. I loved The Beatles Love Cirque show & The Seigfreid & Roy Garden & dolphin show.
10,Very rude staff . They have one answer only like repeated . Don’t allow late check out even VVIP also they don’t case u are gold client or Amex platinum client . Very bad service don’t recommend this hotel
50,All around a great stay! Room was nice and clean and very spacious. Bell desk took care of our bags until our room was ready and promptly brought them up. The pool area was very nice and big. Definitely will be back!
50,The only a couple things that were a little disappointing. Other than the items for sale there is no refrigeration for supplies or food. The wall paper was peeling off in some places as well. Overall a beautiful property with amazing staff!
50,I have been using Caesars rewards but switched to MGM & stayed at the Mirage (before it goes away). All aspects of my stay were excellent from the very friendly staff to the clean room. I would highly recommend it.
50,Overall we had a great experience. Room pool spa casino restaurants were amazing. Had some small issues but staff quickly resolved them. Only thing we didn’t like was all the hidden fees. However we still greatly enjoyed our stay and definitely will be coming back.
50,We love staying at the Mirage.  We love that it’s a decent size but not overwhelming.  We at at 3 different restaurants and relaxed at the pool.  It was a much needed get away for us especially my husband.  Highly recommend staying at The Mirage
50,The Mirage has been a hotel that I have always wanted to stay at but never have. We had the opportunity this past week and it was great. The beds and Pillows were comfortable everything else was great. I recommend All of the MGM Casino/hotels to stay in.
50,What a wonderful experience to spend my vacation here in mirage hotel in hurgada animation team is the best full of energy and fun they are full of joy and the activities are so fun My kids was so excited with the aqua park activities  The hall experience is very nice and hope to be come again
50,I have tried several times to book one of the 1 bed Lanai's at the Mirrage  this time we were sucessfull and WOW was it superb !!    Limo airport transfer included you have your own private entrance to the Villas  They are just so beautifull with your own outdoor space with heated Pool / jacuzzi.    Our stay was made so fantastic by all the staff at the Mirrage ( As usual ) but especially Luxury Experience Host : Amanuel Gebremeskel..  Thank you for all your help and assistance.    I here the Mirrage has been purchased by the Hard Rock...  I so hope it dosent loose its charm and frendleness its what makes the Mirrage the best hotel on the strip !!  I here they want to remove the Volcaino and put up their huge Gituar.... Hmmmm.    I know its the nature of Vegas to keep changing........  But sometimes if it aint broke dont try to fix it.
50,This is the 2nd time I stayed here. I love the location. The cabana is nice and the private pool with is makes it all worth it. Great helpful staff. There were enough craps tables to always have room to play I'm going to miss this place heavily.
40,A -6- because even though I got a free room with comps it doesn’t necessarily means that I didn’t pay anything and I didn’t deserve a bad far away to the Back room.I had to pay resort fees but I have comps for a reason. I had to earn them and spend my money in the MGM rewards. Also I had some money left in my comps and couldn’t access to the free play even after I was assisted. So I left without using my rewards.
50,My Stay was unbelievably nice. The staff was friendly and the service was great. Our room was clean at arrival and the housekeeping kept the room looking amazing. Also the bed was as comfortable as sleeping in my own bed at home.
40,Dated property but still delivered good ol 80's style Vegas fun. Special shout out to Housekeeping staff who were constantly ..cleaning mopping and wiping down. :) Food and service was good at Cali Kitchen. Pool was awesome! Great location best on the strip --very close to Caesars Venetian and Mall. Thank you for a great stay!
50,Still one of the better more affordable hotels on the strip. Will be a shame to have it turn into Hard Rock but they may make it really nice as well. One of the best locations great service/food/entertainment rooms really nice. Would definitely stay again but probably won't be back in Vegas before it changes to the Hard Rock.
50,We loved our recent stay at the mirage! It's the perfect location and it's quick from the room to the strip. The beds and pillows are SO comfortable! I had my best sleep at the hotel out of the 3 we stayed at this trip. The smell is amazing! Only thing that could have been better is if the rewards program wasn't cut by 75% this past year!
40,It was great! Housekeeping did a great job room was quiet and comfy. Starbucks service could have been better but truly enjoyed the hotel and would stay again. Hope you add more shows to the calendar like Wayne Brady- he was the best part of the trip. Thanks
50,Always a nice enjoyable comfortable experience. Never had issues. Comfortable rooms fun bars and tasty dining. Entertainment casino and of course the pool area is just as wonderful. Mirage is always my first choice when I come to Vegas.
30,Always great to stay at the mirage. Location is ideal to get to most of the major casinos. It’s also not a huge casino hotel. Downside is the rooms are dated. Doubt much will improve as they move towards changing it to the hard rock.
40,We stayed in the Staywell rooms. We had a good view of the pool area which was great and also of the Paris Eiffel Tower light show at night. There was a few cracked tiles in the bathroom and the lamp shades need replacing and the carpet could use a shampoo where people had eaten but the room was clean and the staff gave us extra towels quickly when requested. We were happy to catch the volcano show such a shame to lose it. Great central location.
10,Room is out dated bed us not comfortable bathroom is really really small as soon as u open the door the toilet is right there😱🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️you can not have two people in the bathroom at the same time too small carpet in the room feels gross and its nasty no refrigerator in the room just go somewhere else not worth it
50,My room and hotel was perfect. Workers were kind and helpful . I checked in by the app and didn’t have to worry about getting there to check in. When we got to the Mirage there was a line for checkin. Happy there was an app option.
50,Good experience as usual clean facilities…  We dined at Otoro California kitchen snacks. Also we paid a visit to the newly revamped outside bar rum bar and hung out there how to drink liked it there.    Otherwise we were enjoying the pool bar and that’s where we like to hang out. Now if you don’t mind my saying it’s a little crowded around the pool area. The chairs are very close together no tables no umbrellas and white not. As for the service southside excellent we always visit the pool restaurant for late breakfast. As far as gaming goes what can I say we love to play Laura my partner and I . I was surprised when they downgraded me from my goal card I come there a lot considering play a lot lose a lot spend my money at the Sellitti‘s… Anyway all good I’ve already got reservations on September 14 at the Bellagio of tickets to see Aerosmith should be a great time .
50,The Mirage has friendly employees to check you in after a very short wait; parking for the rent car was free with Pearl MGM players card; the whole place is super clean and the location is the very best for conveniently walking to many casinos and places to eat and drink day and night. Have stayed here 8 or so times in last 8 years as well as many other spots on the strip.  Its a fun place to stay. We were there 4 nights.  Hopefully the new owners wont change it much.
50,I love the Mirage! My stay was fantastic! I can’t believe they sold it to the HardRock. They are going to ruin it. The Mirage is so beautiful with all of the Palm trees and water falls. They have the absolute best pool in Vegas just beautiful. It will be a big mistake if they change the pool. Even though it’s one of the oldest it’s the best! I have stayed at many other hotels in Vegas including the new Resorts World I still think the Mirage is the best!
50,Had a great time. Really enjoyed the pool but you do have to get there early to get chairs. Easy pickup area for Uber. Workers were very friendly and helpful. Casino was easy to get around. Many dining options.
40,Very nice for the price. Clean which is important to me. Wasn’t as fancy as the others but was still nice. Pool was great. Surprised how many kids/families were there though. Not a ton but I guess I didn’t really expect any. Was my 1st trip back in 20 years though. Checked in on a Tuesday. By time we left Thursday night the crowd had almost doubled.
50,Great stay as usual! The pool was a bit crowded and never got to sit in a chair. But just made the best out of it. Clean room great view. Staff was great at the desk (very helpful). We ate at Pantry our favorite breakfast and had Dioblos at night!!!! Great food
50,Very clean very happy & cool place to visit lots of fun good customer service  Very commutable rooms & amazing folding show I’m very happy to stay there & enjoy myself also all over nice decorated & lots of slots
40,Clean hotel with a great pool but get there when they open if you want to claim a chair. Great restaurants on property too - a coffee/pastry place and the sports bar were my favorites. I’d stay here again.
50,I also stayed at another MGM hotel during this trip and was extremely disappointed. The Mirage however was an excellent experience - centrally-located casual (but classy) environment spacious room with amenities and a decent selection of slot machines and food choices. I plan to stay at The Mirage again during my next visit.
50,Very nice clean hotel. The entrance is beautiful! I love the aquarium and tropical feeling you get when you walk in. I've stayed at many hotels on the strip and I rank mirage one of my favorites! Definitely worth checking out.
50,Fabulous staff clean everything within reach. Rooms clean great food and drink. Pool was very welcoming and the nights in the restaurants and bars were memorable. Casino was happening and the guests were really enjoying themselves
50,Great hotel. I love my experience here. Easy to find . Parking was packed but its worth it. Most handicap parking were taken on level 4. Must use level 1 if u can't use escalator. I wish the sign was there ir more noticeable. I didn't like how I had to walk across the walk way with my daughter with traffic. I dont kind but I think about it for handicap not as safe as expected  but its doable . I like the rides here and valet area. Super easy to find and not a far walk like other 5 star hotels . It's also easy check out . Can do on phone by email  use their tablet downstairs or do late check out ok tv with extra fee . 30$ till 1pm.
50,Very clean organized people super friendly the entire resort was so clean even the roof we looked over it’s says so much about management. Good variety of food and a a little shopping which I needed a belt.
50,Always have enjoyed staying at the Mirage every time we have came to Vegas for our Conventions. Also love this is a union facility with a well trained staff that definitely know their jobs. Really hate to here they will be changing the name but time goes on.
40,The room was clean and functional. The food and drinks were good. The check in and out process was easy. The location is great! The pool was fun lots of people to watch hip music to vibe along with.
40,"I love the Mirage. Still a beautiful hotel with a gorgeous pool that even has some shade. Great central location on the Strip best show in Vegas (Beatles LOVE). I'll be sorry to see it rebranded when the Hard Rock takes over. But there are a few issues.    First the pool was only open 9am-5pm. There were 300 people in line for the pool at 8am! Why are most banks open for longer hours than the pool? The temperature was already in the 80s.    Second the rooms are starting to show their age. I found 2 electrical outlets in the entire room available for charging phones laptops etc. This is so easy to fix! Get some new lamps with outlets built into them! Then there are the lights -- all uniformly DIM even the ones at the desk.    Finally a few other things. The casino floor smells like smoke--and the ""non-smoking slots"" room was ALWAYS roped off at every hour I went by. All the vanilla in the world can't cover the smoke in the casino. Also there's a real lack of cheaper food options. Every sandwich at every location started at $13-$15--even the take-away food in the gift shop. Finally other than at tables/slots in the casino and the bars/restaurants there's NO SEATING ANYWHERE. I wanted to talk about the great Beatles LOVE show afterward with the person I saw it with and we had nowhere to sit and chat a few minutes. What would be the harm in a few chairs or benches somewhere? Not everyone wants to eat or drink all the time. Also it would be great if they re-opened the Cravings buffet. It doesn't look like they're using the space for anything right now and it certainly seemed like they had a volume of guests big enough to support the buffet.    Hard Rock people please don't kill everything that makes the Mirage special. Don't touch the pool just make the hours longer. Don't touch Beatles LOVE either or the Beatles gift shop :) I wish you'd even keep the Mirage branding but I think that's already lost."
50,Great stay loved our room and the classic vibe of the hotel. When we checked in we were pleasantly surprised with a room upgrade to an amazing pent house suite. I could have stayed the whole trip in that suite! I loved the tropical smell of the hotel and the tropical feel.
50,Another great stay at the Mirage! Comfortable as always! So happy CPK is back up and running! Checkin and checkout were seemless! I wish it were easier to stream on the hotel tv tho…I might just not know how.
50,I stayed at villa with private backyard and private pool jacuzzy 2 large bedrooms each with 2 baths his and hers also guest powder room exeptional interior design and colors expensive paintings and stachus exellent food and service.
50,From start in front desk they were very nice and the room is nice and very clean. But our first night playing is not good we lost a lot maybe we are not familiar with the machines. But the whole stay is perfect specially in the pool. We will come back for sure.
50,We stayed at Mirage this year and last year. We were at the Mirage many years ago on the day it opened. It’s been well-maintained. The restaurants are great. Our favorite was OTORO. The staff is very professional and friendly especially the concierges. Our room was nice on the 23rd floor. Very quiet. Wonderful view of pool and dolphin habitat! Centrally located on strip.
40,great rather have room closer to elevator though food was great looking to return to Las Vegas in August Room temp was a little warm needs to be cooler other than that stay was great. Need to get usr to time change lol
40,Clean room and good atmosphere easy access to strip and other hotels. Online check in was supper easy. Check out was easy and simple as well. Would stay here again in the future and would use the pool in the future….
50,We love the Mirage! Staff is always so friendly and helpful! Food is delicious! Rooms are nice with great views! The pool area is beautiful! Make sure you get the dole whip. We can't wait to return sometime soon!
50,The pool had a cool waterfall feature. Nice outdoor bar for drinks with servers so you could order from your chair as well. Get in line for the pool early if you want a a free chair. Decent location overall on the strip.
50,I had to come stay there before hard rock changed everything. I loved every minute. My fiance had the best mother's day ever. It's right in the middle of everything on the strip. I'm sorry I waited so late to see it. The volcano fire show was phenomenal.
50,The room was great the wireless internet worked well for my business needs the staff was kind and friendly. They did not disturb when the sign was on the door brought clean towels daily and were always available for any needs.
50,The Mirage was a nice mix of excitement and relaxation. Great place for families needing to stay on the strip. Excellent service clean quiet rooms comfortable beds. Very enjoyable place to stay
50,Love the Mirage and the people who work there Willie Haddock and the people I have known for years make sure I'm happy and treat me like family- I can Gamble and lose my money anywhere but you can't bet the Mirage
50,The rooms are clean and the location is great. We stay here every time we come to Vegas. Room service is fast and it has one of the best pools. We always get a couple chairs in the private oasis which is a quieter area of the pool. If you like being in the crowd the main pool is perfect.
50,Annual Siblings Getaway. Easy to coordinate meals activities etc. It was extremely hot so much of time was at Mirage. Also using Uber the Mirage is the most convenient to arrive and pick up. We went to other hotels during visit
50,We loved it! The property is about beautiful. I love all the greenery and water falls. The music at the pool could of been a little louder. Lol but the whole experience was awesome. The sandwich place was delicious.
20,No heater no heater no heater no heater . Was moved to three rooms the last being a hospitality suite and still no heater. Asked for a view got garbage thrown out of the windows of past guests. So my entire stay in the room I kept the curtains closed
50,My girlfriend and I decided to travel to Vegas to celebrate my birthday. As always the Mirage is my preferred resort to stay at. We were very pleased with our time at the property and will for sure return in the fall.
50,Beautiful property. Love the pool large tropical fish tank and the aquarium screen savers on the room TVs. The Dole Whip drinks at a high light to a great day at the pool. The volcano show is unexpected but unique and a must see.
50,We just spend our vacation here and loved it.  The staff room and the pool are awesome.  It's easy to get around and the pool if very tropical!  The restaurants are excellent! Our favourite is Otoro!  We would defiantly recommend.
50,My wife and I came to Mirage for our anniversary. Everyone was helpful and the service was excellent. Our room overlooked the volcano show and the strip. It sad the this will be our first and last time experiencing the Mirage since being sold. We can't thank the staff enough for a wonderful experience.
40,I initially booked the stay well suite but when we got to the room the mattress was very hard and uncomfortable. They switched our rooms very fast and easy but I was Disappointed that the room wasn’t up to our expectations.
40,The bed was very comfortable. It was a standard room and bathroom but the staff was always friendly. It's a great location on the Strip. Close to food Walgreens the bus stop to Fremont St and the Monorail.
30,Vegas is not like it used to be. You spend all your money on your room and food leaving nothing to gamble with. I used to enjoy Vegas you knew the casinos were there to separate you from your money but it wasn't blatant. Today it seems like gambling is an after thought.
50,My wife and I just stayed there for our 29th anniversary. All the staff were fantastic. Rooms were really clean and the casino was awesome. It’s close to everything on the strip. We had a little problem with our my Vegas slots room comp so we had to pay full price for our stay instead of the two free nights we had but it was still worth it. We are planning on going back in February or March for a week!
40,The front desk clerk was extremely nice the room was clean with the exception that I had to request that it be cleaned only once. The pool was closed at 5 and my children wanted to swim longer. The access was easy to the strip.
50,Everything was so prefect  we ARE coming back  Customer service was excellent  Adult pool was amazing  Drinks were on point  Front desk was very friendly  Casino was super clean and it didn’t smell like smoke like other casinos do
50,We love the Mirage. This was our third stay and the resort is as beautiful as ever. We did the mobile check in using the MGM app and printed our own room keys so no line to wait in. Everything went smoothly. We chose to forgo housekeeping for our four night stay and were able to just grab new towels at the midway point. We also paid for a guaranteed late check out (3:00pm) which was totally worth it to us to have the room an extra four hours. Our favorite part of the experience is the beautiful pool area. Yes you have to get there early to get a chair but we were on east coast time so getting in line at 8:20-8:30 was not a big deal to us. You can bring in pretty much whatever you want (snacks and drinks) but they do check your bag for something. I was told they were looking for glass items which are not allowed for obvious safety reasons. I have heard that Hard Rock bought the Mirage from MGM and I’m hoping they don’t change much because it is pretty perfect the way it is! Only complaint was the mattress was hard.
30,"We had an overall good time; the grounds pool and Sigfried and Roy's Secret Garden were cool. But the service was very subpar for a ""luxury resort."" Glad we stayed once but wish we'd have tried it when it still had luxury service."
50,We had a exceptional trip as a couple. Everything was just as described and better. Great location pool food and staff. Room clean and nice. We will definitely return here. Staff friendly and on top of it.
30,I have always wanted to stay at the Mirage and I found out I wasn't missing much.    First impression at check in wasn't good. I did not feel I was being welcomed to the Mirage I felt like I was more of a bother. She was super unfriendly while checking us in. She never talked directly to us just mumbled things while looking down. We didn't even understand what she was saying.    Room was dated. Furniture chipped and scratched up.  No outlets at beds to charge phones.    Toilet was constantly running non-stop and was very noisy. We did call maintenance and they fixed it the next day.    Windows were very dirty hard to see clearly out.    Bathroom was very small. Hardly had any towels.    Only received housekeeping once during a three night stay.    We were woken up each night by loud people in the halls. One time it was a security person who was going up and down our hall speaking very loudly on a radio. This went on for quite a while. We could hear the conversation back and forth from the radio. You'd think they could use wireless headsets or something to minimize the sound.    Ate at the poolside restaurant once. Had good service there but had a hair in the food. They apologized and took the price off the bill and remade the meal.    We couldn't find any empty chairs at the pool. Seemed like people were just saving chairs with towels all day.    Slots in their casino were super tight. We played at many casinos on the strip and were able to win at those but never won at the Mirage.    I really wanted to like this hotel but it had way more cons then pros.
40,I think that the Mirage is still one of the nicer properties on the LV Strip. The Room was in good condition and clean. They DO NOT have refrigerators and although coffee was somewhere I did not find it easily. I wish there was a way they could restrict MJ smoking to specific floors so those of us that wish to stay away from it could  The security was present and we felt safe here too. The Resort fee is an absolute turn off though. I had to pay that fee of $39 on top of parking $15 for a 14 hour stay. Now that was a real turn off. Guests of the hotel should NEVER pay for parking.
50,Just simply had a great stay. Nice room. Nice view. Beautiful decor with the iconic volcano. Such Vegas classic and still very well kept up. Fun new bar outside with new and very classy restaurants and other bars. The smell of the piña colada when you walk in welcomes you and will stay with you the whole time on the property. It’s also beautiful outside and your walk to the stop. Never a bad site. Great Stay!
30,We enjoyed the staff and hotel room but the bed was like sleeping on the floor. The pool was great and great food. Except for the bed we truly enjoyed everything. The show outside by the water fall was very good
50,The stay was absolutely amazing. The food in the restaurants was spectacular I could not be happier with the friendliness of the hostess and waitress that was a repeated nature on my 7 night stay. They remembered me at the heritage steakhouse greeted me Mr Davidson it’s nice to have you back with us. The welcoming is something you really appreciate it makes you want to come back to for dinner and drinks every night.
30,This hotel is getting dated. Did the online check in and our room was ready by 2pm. The walk to the elevators from the front door is quite far! Room was very dated carpet was bubbling. But the beds were comfy. But overall quite disappointed considering it’s a 4 star hotel. Our room did not have a view but that was expected for the price we paid. But when we looked out our window you could tell that the hotel does not keep that area clean. Underwear on the ground garbage. Would not stay here again.
50,The room was surprisingly large and very clean. The casino was clean and all staff friendly. Could’ve had a better view but Red Rock was in the distance and that was nice. The bed was very comfortable.
50,We have stayed at The Mirage twice in the last 7 months. It is at a great location on the Strip there are alot of good restaurants and the pool is wonderful. All of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful.
50,Wow... it was great. The staff room I love ❤ it.will do it again soon. The lovers & friends I saw Whitney Houston concert. The people there is very friendly. We road the bus and met Aot of people from different states.
40,Hi just back after 10 days in Vegas...this was my second time here the first being 20 years ago.but a few of our party had been more recently..  Firstly bring lots of money the prices are very expensive everywhere for food and drink.  Bud lite bottle $10 is the normal..breakfast in hotels will set you back $40 per person.  Walgreens is definitely the busiest shops on the strip selling water for $1.99 and beer from $2.49.  Also sandwiches from $3.99.  For cheap food and drinks head to the ends of the strip or just off to various bars and restaurants..  The black bear at South shopping centre was excellent.  We all had a blast in Vegas just alotmore expensive than past years....
40,We enjoyed a couple free nights (excluding the fees and taxes) and it was very enjoyable. I would stay there again if the price is right. I'm a Beatles fan and a magic fan so the fact that the Cirque show LOVE and Shin Lim were there was a plus.
50,I always have a great time at the Mirage it is the only hotel I stay at in Las Vegas and the reason is is because there are some employees there that I have become great friends with. To me the Mirage is my home away from home
20,The casino was the worst ever- no payouts not able to play a while. They were super tight. We went off sight and had a better time. Resort fees are excessive. Drink and food prices are excessive. Price gouging at its best.$8.00 for a bottle water is robbery. Wont stay at resorts like this anymore.
10,There was pieces of carpet all over the floor. It looked like a rat came and scratched up the carpet. Paid extra to give me a view of the strip and pool. Was downgraded because they said they didn’t have another room! Big hotel and not another room with similar or better amenities! Very very disappointed!
30,The bathroom doesn’t look like the one they show you on the pictures. I felt like I was at a motel. There is no sink cabinet for you to place things. The bathroom lighting is poor. The floor wasn’t cleaned.
30,I hit the trifecta on my most recent trip. The first night I had a barking dog in my hallway from 12 to 2:30AM. I was told nothing could be done. The second night at 12:30 AM the fire alarm went off. The third night no noise but house cleaning decided to skip my room. Otherwise things were good at this hotel
40,Resort and location were excellent. The cleaning staff was exceptional and friendly. The only reason for the 4 star review is that the buffet was still not open; I went last year and they weren't open. This is a very family friendly place. This may be my last chance at staying here since they will be putting a big guitar in place of the volcano when Hard Rock converts it.
50,We've The Mirage I'm only sorry the Poker room has been closed. The Mirage is our Vegas Home we love it there. Awesome staff very welcoming. Awesome Rewards program.. Best Casino in Vegas. Will never stay anywhere else. A little disappointed it has been sold
50,Enjoyed the Mirage immensely. I love the location on the strip the staff was friendly and very helpful. Unlike a lot of hotels on the strip the uber is close to the registration desk and you don't have to walk yourself to death to get a ride.
30,Hotel was nice and room rate was reasonable but drinks for $30 and $6.95 for coffee? Had to line up 30 minutes before the pool opened to get a chair unless you paid another up charge to rent or pay for a more private pool.
50,Rooms were very clean staff amazingly attentive gorgeous pool area close to everything. Convenient location at the Heart of the strip boulevard. Lots of activities to do in the hotel kids loved the secret wild habitat.
50,Love it.. Always have fun in Vegas. 3rd Stay at Mirage. Would go back. Mirage makes me feel 1st class. Rooms are clean. Staff is friendly. Casino is nice. Good location. Right in the middle of the Strip.
40,Chose this hotel because it won’t be around much longer. It is an icon on the strip and we are sad to see it go! The volcano show out front attracts tons of people and is really cool to see.  We checked in around noon and our room was ready. We didn’t ask for an upgrade but were given a beautiful room facing the pool on the 23rd floor with a partial strip view.  The casino is top notch - had great drink service at the slots casino is really big and lively. Two nice bars with some lounge chairs to just sit and listen to music.  We ate at Diablos (Mexican) which was really good.  The gem of this place is their pool. Tropical feel and lots of chairs that you don’t have to pay for. Great food and drink service poolside all the chairs have a QR CODE if you want to order that way too. Really loved our pool time the only down side was people line up very early for the 9 am opening for the pool - gone are the days of being able to go down to the pool and find a spot any time of the day. We got in line at 8:45 am and didn’t have an issue getting two chairs.  We also saw BEATLES LOVE - which was excellent. Highly recommend.  Location is also a plus so many fun places/casinos surround the Mirage. It’s a gem!
30,Trip was fun couldn't get a place by the pool without lining up at 8:15 so really couldn't use it which was annoying sleep quality bad due to noise (changed room once helped a bit) but the rewards program was great.
50,We enjoy coming to Vegas especially on our anniversary. We started at our 20th and we have been there every year except 2020 and 21 because of covid couldn't wait to get back. It was an amazing week can't wait to come back
30,I don’t mind old furniture but this was dirty. The chairs were stained and the counters were dirty. The fridge door light switches lamps and window sill all dirty. I used the wipes I had to clean so I could feel comfortable touching things.
40,The location is great and you are right there for the volcano show at night. The rooms are average but clean. Everything was nice except the wifi signal was horrible and cellular signal also. I had to work and couldn't get any signal inside the hotel which forced me to work out front outside in the heat for 8 hours. The business center was closed when I needed to login for work. Also I needed a refrigerator to keep my water cool and a microwave to warm my food. The housekeep was beyond nice She was friendly and cleaned very well. She made us feel welcomed.
50,My stay was exciting full of fun and enjoyment. The assigned room I bunked in is nice and perfect to rest after a long day of drinking dining and gambling. The staff was all wonderful helpful friendly and very polite. Thank you to the front desk employee ( Miss Milly) for the speedy processing of our checked in.
40,We enjoyed our time at the Mirage and are sad to hear it will be changing hands. The location of the hotel is perfect for enjoying multiple parts of the strip but we found we spent a great deal of time staying at the resort too. The pool was very nice but it is very expensive to get reserved chairs or a cabana. Would be nice if there were more umbrellas at the pool.
50,The rooms were spacious modern and very clean.    The entire property was very well kept.    All of the staff were friendly and accommodating.    The food selections were great we didn’t have to leave the hotel to satisfy everyone’s dining wishes.    What more could you ask for?
10,Dirty room ie. stick for one of the blinds was broken wall socket didn’t work hairball in shower empty beer can on window sill false eye lash found on floor. Very disappointing. Won’t ever stay here again
10,Horrible.. place should be imploded staff needs to be retrained on customer service. The rooms are disgusting. The MGM rewards is a joke they jammed up my play(rating) .. Shame on MGM. Caesars Entertainment is really organized
50,The Mirage was fantastic! We spent 14 days there this May and had a blast. The casino staff hotel staff food pools and host were amazing. We won two jackpots but lost overall. We still had a wonderful vacation. The location was perfect on the strip. There is a tram to go to TI and a short walk gets you to Harrahs Linq Caesar’s Paris Bellagio and cosmo. Wear good shoes when you venture out. The pool was our favorite along with the one bedroom suite. We are sad that Mirage will be no more once Hardrock takes over. We hope that they keep their staff and that the clientele doesn’t change to a frat party environment. We will see what evolves. In the meantime we will stay as often as we can. The only downside is the new mgm players program you definitely feel the difference after heavy gaming. They need to rethink this change!
50,Always a good stay with our favourite pool.  Staff is friendly. Check in with the app was awesome as we didn’t have to wait in line when we got there. Always fun. Rooms are clean and staff was great. Small glitch with pool chair reservations but the staff made it right.
50,Wonderful hotel and staff! The hotel was upscale while still feeling inviting. Several great food options were located inside the hotel as well. We will definitely come back! And the volcano was amazing!
50,Perfect location  affordable and my favorite Vegas vacation. Tropical island beauty still resonates after 30 years. Highly recommended that you get there before it is turned into another Hard Rock hotel.
50,Everything was okay front desk was very nice  The rooms are clean and everybody is nice to us the whole casino are very accomodating  Well situated on the strip especially near other casino nice restaurants
20,Room not clean. Beer bottle tops under bed and nightstand. The snacks had been previously opened nuts and candy everywhere and unnoticed by staff. No toilet paper. Sheets smelled like hair oils..etc
40,Hapy with our stay at the mirage. Our only complaint was difficulty getting lounges at the pool. You need to get to the pool early to secure a lounge. Once your towel is on a lounge you are pretty set for the day. No-one checks how long you are gone and no-one takes your towel away.
50,Had to book a stay at this resort before the Hard Rock takes it over and probably destroys it. I must say we thoroughly enjoyed our 2 night stay. Great experience !    Stayed in a Stay Well room with a pool view  ate at Diablos Cantina and Loved the pool area. I recommend getting a chair by the Oasis Pool.
50,Check in to check out. A+. Staff friendly at every job. Outstanding service. Clean. Good gambling venue. Volcano is always a treat. Many different types of restaurants. Quick food or take your time. I will definitely be back.
50,Love love love The Mirage! Great hotel not too big yet a nice variety of dining options. Beautiful pool! Very friendly and helpful staff. I had a small issue with my room safe and there was someone there in 10 minutes to fix it. I will truly miss this place!!!!
50,Great please don’t change the pool area!! Nice staff rooms are great! Clean machines could pay a little better! Ha ha Hope the Hard Rock doesn’t gear the change to just young people! We always stay there!
40,Great experience from check-in through check-out. Excellent customer service and cleanliness. The spa and massage were great and definitely plan to visit again. The Mirage is in a great location on the strip and has a nice pool area.
50,Loved our girls trip everything was great! Most of the slot hit I had from my whole stay was at the mirage casino food was a little pricey but it was great food our over all visit was awesome will definitely stay again.
50,Great service and nice clean rooms. I wish there was a nonsmoking casino area. The pool area was great as well. Restaurants had good food and service and loved the online check in for everything you do there.
50,Beautiful hotel staff was very friendly! Great family vacation! Definitely will have to come back again! Easy access from the airport to the hotel! Hotel was very nice  cleaning staff was on point always had are room cleaned each day ! Thanks Mirage
40,Hotel staff were very pleasant to deal with. Room was very comfortable. Enjoyed the pool and waterfall. Great location on the strip that was within walking distance of everything we wanted to to do and see.
50,Very nice hotel. The Food in the hotel  Was great. We are at 3 different restaurants the Italian res was very very good. Breakfast at Pantry was good too.  Check in was easy “Frank” helped me there. He was awesome. Thank you
50,I have stayed at most hotels on the strip and The Mirage is my favorite! It’s not the biggest or the fanciest anymore but it was the first mega resort and blends that and still has some old Vegas feel as well. The location is great the pool is amazing love the restaurants has the dolphins and tigers and so much more. I am very sad that it was sold and will be rebranded. It was the first place I ever stayed in Las Vegas back in 1993 and it’s the place I stayed the most. Hoping to get back one more time before it’s gone.
50,Great check in service. Room was nice. Enjoyed the volcano show which is why we stayed since HARD ROCK wants to tear it down ! Horrible!  Everything else was great. What a shame that this Vegas icon is going to be torn down.
50,Great room great restaurant’s  plenty of slots (but didn’t win). Pleasant check-in and check-out staff. Great location on the strip! Came home and booked my next trip to Vegas staying at the Mirage.
50,So much fun. I loved staying at the Mirage. Very nice hotel AND Casino. Loved the Still on taco Tuesday and the California Pizza Kitchen was great. Great location on the strip too! I would recommend the Mirage to anyone.
50,Great location! Make sure you download the app for easy check-in and room key access through your phone! Easy checkout as well. Just be prepared for the resort fee and $100/day being held on your card! I wasn’t ready🤦🏽‍♀️😂
50,Just a great place to come and relax!!! The staff friendly and they have nice variety of food options. I like the steak house with the wood fired grill. The casino is small enough to find somebody if you are traveling together but they have great variety of table games and slots.
50,Always stay at this casino when I go to Las Vegas . They have great food and slots. House keeping cleaned my room everyday. Take insulin and they gave me a refrigerator to keep my insulin in. Able to see a show.
50,All was great. The only complaint was faucet in bathroom was a trickle of hot water that came out.  Otherwise everything else was great.  We had pizza and salad for lunch and had a snack at Starbucks.  We were disappointed that the deli was gone but will try the new restaurant next time.
50,The stay was excellent. The staff was excellent. The food was very good. The room was very clean we I check in. The snack bar was best place to eat. I love 24/7 essential store whenever need something quick and easy.
50,Me and my wife have stayed I. Different hotels when we stay in Las Vegas the mirage was the one that blew us away from the park garage to check in to the rooms everything was well set up to be fast and efficient will definitely be staying there again
50,The Mirage has a great location. A variety of restaurants. Rooms are nice. Great value! We continue to return time after time. Easy to access central location to access the strip. Great deals available!
50,This is the second time within a year I stayed at the mirage and both times I was very happy with the whole experience at your hotel staff were very helpful and courtesy I would recommend your hotel to all my friends
50,I love staying at The Mirage friendly staff nice rooms. The is a great selection of restaurants from breakfast food to tacos Italian and two great steaks house. The pool area is great plenty of chairs and great cocktails.
50,We love the Mirage! It’s been our go to spot for every Vegas vacay! Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Casino is fabulous and fun. Their pool is relaxing. Sports book is the place to go for the game.  And the Rhumbar is great way to end the day.
40,From check in to check out service was amazing.  The lights they use to illuminate the building suck. Makes it difficult to look out at night. Other than that a thumbs up to the Mirage. It's going to sad to see it go.
30,I love the Mirage. But I hate that they took away free parking for Gold members. I am very willing to tip nicely for valet but no on top of a $20+ fee. Forget it. I tried to be open and honest but you want more chatter. Geez.
50,Service was excellent and I had a great time. Pool was the best part of the trip. Dining was also very convenient and had good options. Would def stay there again and overall great experience. Hope to go back soon.
10,We have enjoyed all are stays at the Mirage Resort /Casino. We enjoy the rooms in the towers. We had a good check in from staff. We had good service well gambling from the drink ladies we enjoy the slot machine choices. We enjoy the pool area for relaxing and the pool side Restraunt to start our day. Are only complaint is our whole group misses the VLT this Restraunt was always on the top of our list to enjoy.
50,Nice I loved it I felt so safe it was very convenient to all of my attractions very secure I will definitely visit again. And I did gamble a little staff was very friendly and attentive. The Mirage is the best.
50,We had a very nice time. The staff throughout our stay was amazing. The casino (we lost hahaha) was very fun. The restaurant & bar areas were very satisfying. It was an anniversary weekend that will have memories of a lifetime
50,The room was very nice that we received. A good view of the volcano.  Staff was very friendly. Slot machines were very tight. Disappointing. Atmosphere was exciting. Restaurants were of a good variety. Like everything in Las Vegas very expensive
50,My staying was excellent. Customer service was awesome. I really enjoyed my double bed that I stayed in. The Mirage was one of the best hotel I stay at in Vegas. Aria is also one of my favorite to stay in.
40,They were very accommodating. Azzie at the front desk did everything to make my stay as pleasant as she possibly could. The pool area was beautiful. Only problem was the public smoking. But that is just about everywhere in Vegas
50,I have always had a Vip experience at the Mirage. Proffessional staff and fun casino Good food also near many attractions on the strip. I have made the Mirage my go to destination in Las Vegas I am looking forward to my next stay there.
40,"Hotel in General was very nice and accommodating. Xander at the front desk was awesome. Wait staff in casino was horrible. Wife ordered a soda a when waitress came back thru wife asked where her diet Pepsi was and waitress said ""I didn't get you one and I won't bring you one"""
50,A short stay at the hotel but it was very enjoyable. The beds were comfortable and the room was clean and quiet. A nice location on the strip that provided easy access to other locations nearby. It will be interesting to see the changes once Hard Rock remodels the hotel.
50,I enjoyed my stay at the Mirage. My room and view were perfect. I would make sure that my room isn’t close to an elevator but overall the Hotel does not disappoint. The staff is super friendly and accommodating
50,Love this place! My absolute go to when I'm in Vegas!! Unfortunately this last trip 5/22 will be the last as MGM is selling it to Hard Rock and The Mirage will be gone!!! It's a staple in Vegas with the Volcano Show.
50,I love the mirage so much I wish it would stay the same foreverrr!! Laid back but clean and safe and funnnnn. There’s nothing like it on the strip . Gonna miss it . I guess I’ll have to start going to the bellagio now . G vibes
50,To this day the best resort for the value in the best location on the Strip. From food choices to bars/lounges service to pool the Mirage is the best! A quick drive from the airport and a few minute walk to everything.
40,1st stay at Mirage was for 8 days / 7 nights. Very pleasant staff clean room. Convenient to a lot no car needed. Mirage Conference center is beautiful and our event was handled exceptionally by their staff.
10,Room is terrible. Very small and no amenities. only two bigger towels. No water to drink. No fridge to keep baby food. TV is not working even properly. No microwave. There should be courtesy at least free water what I get from 2 start hotel even. No thing free over there.
50,The rooms were clean the chocolate almonds in the bar are delicious the staff was very responsive when we needed extra pillows and other housekeeping items. The price was reasonable the location was central to everything. I would definitely stay again!
50,Great Hotel no issues other than the mattresses were harder than the floor Seem to be the talk at the elevator. Mirage was bought out hate to see it go. Icon and staple of the strip. Great location on the strip.
30,rooms were ok  location ok  could not get a server in the gambling area for drinks---pit boss was no help manager was no help...I had to leave my table and walk to a bar and PAY for what should have been complimentary drinks.  Never again Mirage.....too many choices in Vegas for this treatment.
40,Great location. Great layout. A little dated but all in all a great hotel. I noticed my car was damaged so I asked to see the cameras from when I dropped the car off. They did not oblige. Take photos of your car as you drop it off. Word of warning!
10,The room tub would not drain. Toilet wasn’t flushing correctly. Pool staff rude and you had to chase them down for service. Prices for food was outrageous. Housekeeping was late to clean room and we were in the room when they came so we said nevermind just give us towels.
50,The stay well suites are very nice pool is amazing get the breakfast burriot and a margarita in their travel cups hit up Otero for some sushi and go see Beatles Love Cirque Du Soleil. You don't ever have to leave the resort it's all there!
30,When you hear the name “Mirage” you think that’s the best Vegas has to offer but it’s way over priced with upgrades needed like yesterday. The room reeked of old wet moldy carpet. The bed felt like I was sleeping on a comforter covered box spring. I was there for a convention and wasn’t really spending much time in the room so I just bared with it. It made my 1st stay in Vegas less than I expected but none the less the staff was courteous and professional.
10,Valet was free and fast. Now its 30 bucks a day and extra slow. 30 minutes wait to get valet. Front glass doors dirty no coffee in room very basic room with horrible view. $93 bucks for basic breakfast in room. Slow delivery food was a tad under awful.
30,The bathroom was really small. The room was a nice size. I would not stay here again. The bathroom was not as clean as it should have been. The size of the room was fine the bed was comfy but I just needed a bigger bathroom to really enjoy the stay
50,Our stay at the Mirage was great. Rooms were clean and well stocked. Pool was amazing and friendly staff. Great location to restaurants and Caesar Forum for shopping. We were there for a birthday celebration and the restaurant delivered 22 stacked pancakes as a surprise.
30,Chose this hotel for the Love theater so the location can't be beat obviously. The rooms are outdated. Furnishings are worn. Colors are dark and depressing. Carpet is yuck. Otherwise the people are great food is ok the Beatles Love show is awesome and those are the important things.
50,This hotel and casino is in the perfect location for staying on the strip! Beautiful amenities and great service from the hotel employees. The restaurants and bars are very well kept. The rooms are very comfortable.
10,The room doesn’t look life it’s been updated since the 70s the bathroom is so small you can’t shut the door if you are sitting in the commode the A/C half worked the bed was uncomfortable the room didn’t get serviced one day the safe had to be replaced did not clean the room very well.
40,It was a great first stay at the Mirage and I'd stay there again but I believe it will be undergoing rebranding/remodeling as the Hard Rock is taking over soon. Also would love a refrigerator in the room that wasn't full of the overpriced stuff....just need an empty one to put leftovers/beverages in.
10,the moment you lift anything in the mini fridge you get charged $200? yes!! you hear that right insanee!! so whoever reading this dont lift nothing in the bar dont even go near that bar or much better find yourself a better hotel
50,I've been coming to mirage since 1989 with my family and love it. It doesn't have the flash that some of the newer resorts have but the pool is amazing! It opens at 9am and I saw people on my last trip lined up at 730am to grab the best spots. My family always feels safe there the staff is great pricing is reasonable for the strip location couldn't be better and I often feel like I've stepped into the south pacific. Big Shout out to Amanuel Gebremeskel from the Luxury Department for always making us feel special.
40,The rooms are nice but a little out dated. The toilets are extremely low to the ground so if you have bad knees get a room with handicap accessibilities. Other than that the stay was great. The staff is amazing and the restaurants were great. If you ever stay here you have to try the breakfast burger from Snacks. Best burger I have ever had.
50,I've stayed at the Mirage for multiple trips and it is always lovely. The rooms are comfortable and spacious well furnished and well thought out. The restaurants are fantastic specifically Costa.  The pool is a highlight. As long as you get in line earlier than it opens you will have a great seat. If you splurge on a cabana at the adult pool it's heavenly with great service.  Expensive sure but worth the $$.
50,We honestly could not have asked for a better hotel to stay at. Everything was really clean staff was great. And food was amazing. If we could rate this a 15 out of 10 we would. There are many hotels at the strip but we definitely pick the right one
30,The staff was very friendly and the strip view was great! However the rooms are in need of an update and there didn't seem to be a lot of attention to cleanliness. There was quite a bit of noise that comes from the hallway. The bed was VERY comfortable however and the room spacious. Decent value for the price just dont look too closely at the little details
50,I love the Mirage and it is my favorite hotel to stay in when in Vegas. The view the cleanliness the staff the rooms the check in and check out process the concierge the location all make it a wonderful location and a great stay
30,Upon arrival room was not ready for check-in was informed that I would receive a text when room was ready. After waiting for over 3 hours I went back to front desk and worker told me it was my phone type why I didn't get the text. ( Android) Went to room and cable wasn't working in the room. At check out found out they tried to charge me for my stay which was paid in full upon arrival. Worst experience and possible will never stay here again.
30,This was not a typical stay. It has always been exceptional. It will get better. I truly believe it is a result of being understaffed. I will still return and stay at The Mirage because loyal customers stick with you and give you feedback to get better.
50,We absolutely loved our stay and the pool was a blast! The dolphins were an added treat. The beds were great and we slept like a dream. Thanks Mirage and Mirage staff for helping make our trip to Vegas wonderful!
40,The experience at mirage in May 2022 Was Great Outside of the Rooms. The hotel is great far as amenities and things to do inside hotel but the rooms are average hotel rooms far as furniture and bath tubs are outdated need new up to date tubs
50,Extremely easy check-in process via the mobile app and very easy and accesbile self-parking. There is also a wonderful dog friendly area outside. The room was immaculate and I cannot wait to get back!
40,Always a pleasure at the Mirage. Friendly staff great ambience tables are fun lots of slots too. Stayed for 4 days and took-in a show couple of restaurants lots of onsite amenties for everyone. Would recommend! Right on the strip!
50,I travel to Las Vegas about 2 to 3 times a year. Have seen pretty much all the shows and stayed in about 80 % off the Hotels/Resorts. I do love to play slots and also spoil myself in restaurants.I love staying at the Mirage because it's well managed and right in the middle of all the fun. When I travel with grand kids the Excalibur used to be my choice but It's starting to go in the direction of Circus Circus. I seem to get more comps with the CAESERS resorts then i get with MGM especially my Valet parking which is a must.
50,Wife and I went to Center Bar at Mirage to listen to DJ and have some drinks. Victor the bartendar was amazing. He was so professional warm and inviting personality and helped us throughout the night. He makes a mean cocktail. Thank you for the evening of entertainment.
50,Stay here while you still can since MGM sold the property and it's going to get replaced by another casino/hotel soon. Lots of tradition and lore. Going to miss this place. All the employees are great and the amenities are amazing. Pool could be a little warmer but I'm sure during the summer there won't be any complaints on that end.
40,Well kept property but rm was a lil dusty. The staff on floor 24 was friendly & knowledgeable of the city. The property is pretty big & the pool area was relaxing. I was there on business but got a chance to enjoy the amenities & extra services the Mirage offered.
50,This is my favorite hotel on the Strip. The rooms are quiet the casino is engaging and exciting and the restaurants are 5-star. The staff could use some weeding out but it just a few rude 'tudes in the midst of some really genuinely great people who work there. The Mirage will forever be my one and only love in Vegas.
50,Mirage is large but not too large that you get lost in it. Friendly staff great food pleasant cocktail waitresses informative dealers and many varieties of table games card games slots video poker and other video games.
10,Do not waste your time and money in this place. It's yuck!! Customer Service is Yuck!!! I don't like the demographics either and people smoking pots disgusting. Nothing new...the US is disgusting...so Bye-den!!
20,A lot of flies and wasp in the room. I killed at least 3 bugs in the room. When I tried contacting the front desk for room service or help The phone in the room wasn’t even on . I asked the front desk for an upgrade and she denied it and said my room is the only option for now. So I basically was forced to sleep in a bug infested room. Good thing I stay up most of the time and I was at the convention  so I barely spent time In The room due to the fact that I was uncomfortable    Needs more staff to assist. Everyone seems busy or doesn’t want to respond
20,The hotel was was dingy and has old dirty carpet throughout. A small bottled water was $6 and a large $10. We ate at the Sushi restaurant and the food was not fresh. The meat was discolored and appeared spoiled. The staff was very friendly and check in was a breeze.
50,The hotel rooms were Clean good size the staff were friendly and helpful without prompting. The hotel has great amenities and they are organized in a easy to access fashion. Reserved this trip through Snaptravel and the trip was flawless!
50,Love this hotel. Great location very helpful employees except for the rewards department. We felt safe and very comfortable here. Beautiful pool area. Just wish they had a few more affordable food options. Hope the quality doesn't go down after it changes over to Hard Rock
50,We had 5 nights here in May 2022 and loved it. We had 2 rooms on different floors the rooms were large rooms too plenty of space to relax in. Both rooms had good air conditioning and good black out curtains which you need. We had a slight issue with our parking but that was sorted with a trip down to the main desk. This hotel is a good distance from the Las Vegas strip compared to some though I felt we have stayed opposite in the Best Western Casino Royale before and you can get to the strip from your room in about 30 seconds. Here though by the time you walk to the lift then through the casino then out the front of the casino to the actual road its like 5 mins away. We loved it though and if I could get a good price I would happily stay here again no problem !
30,Please look at my first response for horrible experiences. If you have further questions feel free to call me 2533472080 Jodie weir thank you so much hope this issue gets adressed and you get someone else in charge to talk to guest
30,The Mirage is rated high by AAA. We had very mixed feelings about it. The room was pretty basic and did not have a refigerator only the mini-bar that you had to pay to use. We were provided with a tiny plug-in unit to use for medication and you could maybe fit a bottle of water and can of pop in it. The bathroom had NO space for toiletries which was very inconvenient. The fixtures were definitely older. Perhaps because the Mirage has been sold and most likely will be torn down in a year or so they just haven't bothered with any upgrades. The lobby and atrium are quite lovely there is a huge aquarium behind the main desk. As with many strip hotels you have to take a hike to get to the elevators to get to your room through the smoky casino.  The pool is very large and well-landscaped with waterfalls etc. Bar and restrooms adjacent. We ate at a few restaurants in the hotel (separate reviews will be done) and attended The Beatles Love Cirque show in the theater that was built in the hotel just for that purpose. You are not inundated with shops as in some of the other hotels. The volcano out front which erupts nightly is fantastic and not to be missed.  If you don't have a cell phone you would be very inconvenienced in this hotel. Everything is by QR codes including the room service menu which is very limited. The restaurants also want to text you when your table is ready.  Overall this is a nice property but the room was definitely not up to snuff for a quality hotel!  And one additional note: you would think that COVID had never happened. No one was wearing masks except for very few of the staff. There were hand-sanitizers all over the place. But masks and distancing were not happening.
40,Enjoyed our stay here. Have stayed at several of the MGM resorts and have loved them all. This was no exception. The staff was friendly the restaurant food was amazing especially for the price. Recommended for any type of travel fily fun business....etc.
30,3 stars because the housekeeping stole a pair of shoes I left in my room. No one from the hotel followed up with me after I submitted notice via email as well as called the lost & found. I have stayed in Vegas hotels far worse than this one but the staff was trustworthy enough to turn item in. Why anyone would want a pair of used leather sandals is pretty disgusting. Shame on whoever cleaned Room 0256 on May 26 2022. To think I left a nice tip for this thieving bum!
10,Got charged with a $178 resort fee that I was never warned about. The room was extremely humid i had it on 69 and wouldnt work. Walls are super thin could hear everyone walking by could hear my neighbors screaming and partying. The bathtub was old and super rusty. For that price I could've got much more.
30,I don’t know what’s going on with the Mirage but this trip was a disappointment. The place is rundown and it makes me sad. It’s not the same hotel it used to be. I couldn’t get over the cheap towels at the pool and charge you $$$ for premium seats at the pool. I don’t think we will be back there.
30,This hotel needs Major updates. We should be offered night life options as well as food choices during checkin. This isn’t something that any of the check in receptionist do. We found a nightclub in the hotel on our way out which was disappointing
20,Who closes their pool DURING THE SUMMER at 5PM? Rooms are dated staff are unremarkable and poorly trained. Shower pressure was poor.    Only saving grace was the location (which remains excellent) and the Volcano which apparently the new owners want to get rid of
40,Nice location price and quality. Staff could of been a bit more informative. Really wish there was a night club on the property but overall I would stay there again and recommend it to family and friends.
30,This room is not worth the extra money the view was not good. Volcano/fountain was off. My kids and I were disappointed. Everything else was great! friendly staff nice big pool very clean plenty of slot machines and tables.
30,When booking I was told I was eligible for $150 free play. After checking in amd settled I went to inquire about the free play. The lady told me that I was not eligible. I would have booked at a different property if I knew this was the case.
30,Rooms are weathered from use over the years and restaurants like Diablo Mexican was not open yet even at 4pm. Shows and attractions are fun. The pools are nice and rewards program is not as good as others in my experience. Room service will come in even if you tell them no thanks. Unfortunately we didn't have a do not disturb door hanger. Use the safe for any valuables.
50,We were upgraded to a 30th floor suite for our one night stay. It was such a wonderful surprise and a wonderful way to end out bucket-list Grand Canyon Trip. The room was beautiful and the hotel offerings were great. We saw the Cirque Du Soleil Beatle Mania Show. It was wonderful. We had a wonderful experience and highly recommend the Mirage. It is worth becoming a MGM Rewards Loyalty Program Member.
50,Had a weekend stay at the Mirage over Memorial Day and had a blast. Staff was extremely friendly and fun. Our suite was clean and provided a lot of room for entertaining. Would definitely stay here again.
10,Not the Mirage I remember. It's gonna be a hard rock owned by Indians so don't plan on winning anything. I'm so bummed this was my favorite hotel but since it's getting shut down they are crappy about the size of drinks and service is terrible now.
50,I came to EDC 2022 a week early for the week/pool parties and this place made it so comfortable to stay. I am probably going to be coming back and staying here again over the other hotels I have stayed at around the area.
20,Unless you are rich don’t stay here. The common treatment sucks and the rooms need serious updates. The service is terrible. The employees are unhappy. This is not the environment they make it out to be
50,Beautiful casual inviting property for so many years only to be replaced with another dreadful iteration of The Hard Rock?! Another Vegas gem vaporizes into the heat waves of the Mojave. The pool is fabulous the Dolphin Bar a favorite haunt. The jungle entrance-the huge aquarium at check in- the volcano- all gone in another year? Big mistake.
50,Few Vegas resorts rival The Mirage both in terms of the ability to inspire long-lasting enriching memories as well as the iconic. A stay here is a guaranteed dream getaway between the exemplary customer service that makes you feel right at home from the onset multiple attractions that lend it in an identity and personality above most other resorts including their famed volcano show that needs no introduction one of the best pools on the Las Vegas Strip and their adorable dolphin habitat and a balance of both casual and fine-dining options. The rooms are also homey and comfortable with a dazzling digital aquarium on their high-definition televisions that provide the most soothing ambient soundscape to complement a deep peaceful sleep on their Perfect Sleeper beds. NO Vegas experience is complete without a stay at The Mirage. =)
50,Had a great visit at the Mirage and really enjoyed the Resort. Pool area was perfect. Also had a chance to see the Beatles Cirque show…fantastic experience. Rented two rooms for a bachelor party and all enjoyed!!!
30,The Shower had hair on the wall the rest of the room was very clean. Talked to someone at the hotel they were supposed to give a credit but did not. The room was nice if it wasn't for the shower issue I would rate higher
50,Great place to stay.. center of the strip. Great prices n service. Only wish they would open the buffet again n the poker room. Sad to see it turning into the hard Rock.  Hope they will create something worth visiting
50,Great place with a good location rooms only a short walk to the strip. Unfortunately it's been sold. Go while you still can not sure what will happen in the future. I hate having to walk a 1/2 mile from the room to the strip.
40,First trip to Vegas. I learned a lot on how to avoid the high prices. First if you like your coffee do as I did and get Amazon to deliver a cheap coffee maker to the hotel. They have a package pick up center and charge you $10.00 for the handling but there is no coffee in the rooms. Bring your coffee and filters. The room refrigerator is full of alcohol and snacks avoid this it's expensive. No free bottled water. Be prepared to pay a lot for food inside the casino. Cheeseburger fries and a drink was $26.00. No microwave in the rooms. There are other cheaper choices across the street. Use Uber for transportation I took a cab from the airport $28.00. If you smoke there are no smoking rooms but you can smoke on the casino floor. For you pot smokers (which I am not live and let live) there is dispensary close and you don't need a medical card but its only 3% from what I am told for $60.00 for a vape pen. The pool was nice. Overall a great place to stay land in the center of things.
30,"Their ""Resort Fee"" is a ripoff of old people like my wife and I. We have no use for their pool sauna and all the other so called extras in their ""resort fee"". They cleverly lump the ""wifi"" in the resort fee so we were effectively charged $40 a day for the use of the Mirage wifi."
50,Great staff wonderful Stay Well rooms. Mobile App works great as a key and other information regarding the hotel and other MGM Properties. Was able to share a key with my wife and even make reservations thru the app.
50,We enjoyed our stay. The room was nice. We did not touch any of the food/drinks in the room after reading a lot of the reviews. The casino area smelled badly from smoke I’m assuming which made me feel sick but that’s more of a personal problem. The restaurants we went to were nice
20,Check in is at 3 pm. I was told our room wasn't ready multiple times. Finally got the notification it was ready around 5:15. Went to the room and a staff member was still cleaning the second bedroom with the door locked. She didn't finish cleaning close to 7. There was a large liquid stain on the ceiling near the bar dust accumulation on some furniture the main phone didn't work the master bathroom lights didn't work and required us to call them to fix it. Overall not worth the $3k I paid for the weekend.
10,Elevator problem. Staff not empathetic. Late to dinner and late to Bill Maher show. Staff not empathetic and had to be escorted through lower level hallways. Maintenance staff was more empathetic than front desk staff.
40,The hotel is bustling and fun. So many restaurants to choose from all great. The pool was jam packed so we didn't get there. Our room was just ok small and darker than expected but quiet. We have stayed in the suites before and they were exceptional.
40,Really great staff & casino experience.  Our room was warmer than we would have liked and we couldn't get the room cold enough for our preference but otherwise a wonderful stay.  The pool area was beautiful the casino had some great games that paid out well. We had a great time.
50,Love love this place great location great food and gift shop. The slots were good too lots of variety and place is not so big that I can find a machine back the next day. We spent our 50th wedding anniversary there  but we have stay there many times and always come back. We are coming back again over the Christmas holiday.
30,Overall the stay was a great time. A couple of the front desk employees left a lot to be desired. Lack of eye contact & lack of sincerity ran rampid. Great room though. No complaints there. I am ADA so I do wish that they had elevators at both ends of severely long hallway as our room was a corner room at end of hall. Can't have it all I guess. Housekeeping was pleasant & always had a smile in their faces. Jax at the pool really knows how to make a great drink! She was so pleasant.
50,5 out of 5 for this stay. Getting checked in was easy the room was better than what I anticipated for a comp. Housekeeping answered on the first ring and had our request delivered in minutes. I was able to work from the room screenshare and stream on basic wifi. The room was equipped for me to use the TV as a much needed second screen. My only objection to my stay was having to leave.
50,Loved my stay here! All staff were nice and the room was so clean. The hotel itself is so beautiful! It’s right on the strip so we had access to everything. The hotel itself provided everything we needed! Will definitely be staying again soon!
10,We went for my daughter’s 10th birthday and to visit some friends. We were given a room wi to a broken bed upon checkin. They did make arrangements to change our room but didn’t communicate it properly with their staff so we were dragged through the hotel and staff elevator to get to the new room and basically accused of lying about the room change. When we went to their restaurant “Pantry” we dealt with racist servers and didn’t even have our drink order taken for 15 minutes in a half empty restaurant with plenty of servers. I would have left had it just been myself and my boyfriend but my daughter wanted their chocolate chip pancakes for her birthday.
50,Excellent place to stay. The Mirage is like our “home away from home”. Staff was friendly accommodating and very clean through out. Pool was great and beautiful. Great experience would stay there again!
50,My wife and I love the Maroge and an offer is an easy check in with a beautiful view of the strip and there’s a reason why we stay there every time we come to Vegas the Maroge is the best and we love everything about it
30,I assume since the property was sold and staffing issues there is no upkeep being done. Hotel was dingy and rundown. Room wasn't ready at 7:30 pm and new room had nuts in the bed and a blood stain on the sheets. The Pantry was terrible.
30,Short stuffing no 24 hours services except casino and overall disappointment with service. Restaurants were overpriced and food was 1 star restaurant quality. Had to spent at least $150 for dinner for two people. Expected much more.
50,The staff at the Mirage is a well oiled machine. The staff makes their work look effortless and blends well the service they give (us) the customer. I call with a problem and with-in minutes it was problems was solved. The staff is very professional and friendly hardworking and happy. I will book again. Thank you Bob L.
10,Was promised / was paying for guaranteed room connection at the time of my reservation. Arrived to find out that was a lie. After spending close to 1 hr trying to figure out the room situation we ended up all squeezing in 1 room so we wouldn't be separated.  Was promised a $200 compensation credit towards room service that was also another lie. Never got a single penny towards room service.    and to top it off our room barely got cleaned. The last day we ended up calling the front desk to ask for the maid service to come by. That lady was super rude and tried telling us they cleaned our room at 3pm. I have tons of pictures and videos providing them wrong.
40,The Mirage is a mainstay on the strip despite the fact that it has been acquired by Hard Rock and will likely fade away into memory. I've always enjoyed staying here it's in an amazing location center of the strip and everything about it is really good. It's not going to blow you away but you won't be disappointed.
50,This was our first time in Vegas and we loved the Mirage. Staff was friendly room was clean our strip view was fantastic. We loved the pool. It is also in a great location. The only time we ran into some bumps were in the restaurants. (Some of the restaurants’ staff were not friendly at all especially at The Still)
50,Everyone wonderful everything works easy logistics starting with parking…. Concierge checked me in Room was fantastic patrons were fantastic employees were fantastic there were no lines and the prevailing attitude was joyousness.
10,I was told by conference coordinators that my rate is 149. They never told me my rate at check in. At checkout they told me it 448 per night plus tax and resort fees. None of managers were willing to talk. They were rude about their customer service.
50,I’ve been in Vegas several times and I always stay at the Mirage it’s a fun place to stay great customer service and when I go back to Vegas I will stay at the same place. Barash it’s always my first choice for a hotel
10,Ac was not working properly in our room it was so warm. Should have expected as much as they do not even give you a real blanket for your bed just sheets. We booked three nights and each day had to go get new room keys .
50,My stay at the mirage was very good! Didn’t have any problems! Staff friendly and room were clean. Casino had good amount of tables volcano show was fun and the location is in heart of Vegas which made it a plus.
30,The Mirage has great restaurants on property and the staff is super friendly. I used the fitness center which is outstanding and the restaurant right next to it had the best wings in the world. The only issue was the bed in the room was hard as a rock.
50,I really enjoyed my first time in Vegas. The hotel was beautiful and clean. I found the bed to be very comfortable. My only suggestion is to have more accessible outlets by the bed. Everything was spacious and well appointed.
30,The bathrooms are small and needs updating. I did have to request a new room upon arriving after finding mold/mildew around the tub of my initial room. The location of the room is in the center of many attractions.
50,Excellent place to stay. Rooms were big and had a great view. Pool was very nice and inviting. Casino was clean and brought you drinks right to your machine. Lots to do right at the resort. Front desk staff was very friendly.
50,Great hotel for a great price made my vacation easy and simple I recommend everyone to stay at this hotel when they come to Vegas the room had an amazing view and the staff were very attentive and friendly
40,Sad to hear Mirage will soon be the Hard Rock. Will miss the volcano  Hope the pool stays the same. The best pool on the strip. Love the tropical feel of the hotel. Dolphins and all animals will be missed too!
10,My family and I did not enjoy our stay the staff is very unfriendly the show preferential treatment. The rooms are old we had a room with stains everywhere. Restaurant food expensive. There are better hotels on the strip with better service.
50,Spend the weekend there for the first time! My family and I loved it!!! Great Customer Service Great beds Housekeeping on point the pool and the bars next to them was amazing!!!!!!!! We will definitely be back.
50,Liked the location just a short walk to the linq promenade fashion show mall  Caesar’s palace Venetian etc . Rooms were clean staff was helpful and quick there is scooter rentals for those who need one and family loved the pool and slot selection .
50,We were extremely satisfied with our six night stay at the Mirage. The room and facility were clean. We very much enjoyed relaxing at the pool. We highly recommend eating at the pool cafe. Most important of all was the professional and friendly service we received from each and every Mirage staff member we contacted. This will be our preferred location to stay for future trips!
50,The pool and Dolphin area can’t be beat but watch out for the poolside chair reservation system. If you don’t make a reservation for the next day when you check in you won’t find lounge chairs for your family.
10,Rooms were not available check in and we’re told that the people staying in the rooms opted to do a late check out which affected everyone in my party. So we were downgraded on all our rooms. Will never recommend.
40,Although the app allows you to pass up the line checking in face to face allows for you to ask where your room is located (my room faced a undesirable roof top) and you also get a key which is much easier to use than the phone app when using the guest elevators unlocking your room and self parking sensor. Overall the inside of the room was nice. Bathroom is small.
10,Not enough help in casino from restaurants to casino. We had a great time at rumbar everyone there was extremely hard working and very nice  could not get into the still bar on sat night  it was half closed due to short staff. Crap table was were extremely crowded only 3 open Thursday and Friday and the 5 guys I was with could not play and that’s why we come there  Very disappointed and probably after 10 years the guys and I this will be our last trip to the mirage
50,Had a great time at this resort. Pool was great food and service was great. Casino was clean and rooms were great! Highly recommend as it is in an awesome location on the strip and has good options for food. Check in and out were a breeze and staff was friendly.
40,Nice hotel. They didn’t have the king bed we requested but ‘comped’ our resort fees for the inconvenience. Asked for a low floor did get that.  Pool area was busy but it was hot so to be expected.  Room was clean. Check in took a bit but all in all a great experience.  Perfect location. We were advised that they were purchased by hard rock. What that looks like going forward and when it will happen?  Great experience would stay there again!
30,No coffee in room no charging ports anywhere near bed room only cleaned one of the days we stayed. For the price of this I certainly expected at least these amenities be provided. Very unlikely I'll return.
50,Great experience friendly and accommodating staff and while it is an older property it is well maintained and comfortable with good restaurants within. The pool areas are nice and very popular. Cabanas are expensive but great if you went a group area.
50,Really enjoyed the hotel. Had that whole moment where you feel like you have finally arrived. Had a yummy dole whip in my slushie while sitting at the pool. Just  a great moment feeling like it was perfect. The Cirque du Soleil show Love was incredible. Recommend to anyone and everyone for that moment.
10,The staff had caused us to wait much longer than necessary because they had made a mistake on their end. We were woken up in the middle of the night by the cleaning staff barging into our room. This was extremely terrifying as we were 2 girls staying alone. Our room's outlets did not work so it was extremely inconvenient charging phones.
10,They are getting ready to remodel it as a hard rock. Good riddance usually a good place this will be my last time visiting this hotel. Makes  Me wary of other MGM properties. Our room was changed during the booking process and we were not notified
20,The Mirage used to be a great hotel to stay at. Right in the heart of the strip it was fun and a beautiful hotel. It has really gone downhill. The staff don’t seem to care about guest experience anymore and the restaurants had terrible service. The food was barely edible even if you got what you actually ordered. It was a waste of money.
50,Had a good stay at one of their 'Stay Well' rooms. It was clean as advertised and I found the resort better than I thought it was going to be. Was able to check in check out and access my room with app easily. Nice location obviously would stay there again if I was in town. Hallways were noisy overnight but that's going to be anywhere in that city.
50,Older property but well maintained with an excellent staff. Wonderful entertainment options and we’ll located on the strip. Beatles Cirque show was phenomenal and Shin Lim was excellent. Will stay here again on my next trip to Vegas!!
10,The hotel rooms in Mirage aren’t clean at all and especially the bathrooms are very unclean. The exhaust fan in hotel room makes very loud sound.  There is no microwave in the hotel room. I had to ask the hotel receptionist twice to make sure I get the 50$ breakfast credit that was promised originally
50,Love this place. Great staff and great machines. Awesome rooms big and great beds. Plenty of room to spread out We got married at the volcano. Great food and great staff. We will be back very very soon.
50,We stayed for 4 nights in the king stay well room.  The bed was very comfortable & the room air purification system/ aromatherapy was a very nice touch! I was worried about a smoke smell but there was no issues!  The only issue we ran into was the refrigerator. They charge you for any use. If you plan on saving food/drink you will be charged. They do have ice machines. The Beatles Love show was AMAZING!! Highly recommend.
50,the hotel is nice the room had no faults. The location is great. The pool was fun. The LOVE show was great. Also next door to Caesars Palace where we saw a concert. Venetian across the street with nice shopping. They don't have a poker room any more but again nearby casinos still have games/tournaments. Just a great hassle free weekend.
50,The pool is so intimate. We felt like we were in a tropical paradise. Staff is friendly and helpful. The casino is clean and staff is very attentive. It is the erfect location on the strip. We cannot wait to come back!
30,The fridge that comes with the room Is essentially a vending machine: they stash snacks and drinks at heavily marked up prices for “convenience”. I wanted a place to store my leftover food for later and to refrigerate my rehydration bottles but it was another $35/day to rent a 2ndary refrigerator.    The bed wasn’t uncomfortable but the pillows were a bit too soft for my liking.    Other than the above the stay wasn’t bad. I had a great time doing everything else in Vegas.
50,The whole experience from the airport to the front desk was very pleasant. Check in went quick with a very unique and refreshing. All the staff was approachable upon arrival. All the was Exceptionally nice even with all the question we had.
50,Had a great friends trip for 3 nights at Mirage. Great location on the strip. Was a great value for the location overall design still holding up well. However going away this year due to replacement by the new Hard Rock hotel and casino. Bye bye volcano show and conservatory.
20,I enjoy the volcano and wildlife area from Siegfried and Roy very much still to this day but the property itself needs massive renovations.  Rooms are dated and need renovations badly.  Also returned home with what appear to be bedbug bites all over my body.
30,After you pay for the room and resort fees. You need to be prepared to pay for a chair at the pool  and outrageous prices on everything at the hotel . If that's your style you will love it. Long gone is reasonable prices in Vegas !! Post Covid prices I guess gotta make it up somehow !!
50,Everything was great! First time staying at Mirage. Such a beautiful hotel & casino with great restaurants sports bars and lounge/bars. I would have loved to see the dolphins tho. Would stay there again if they weren't replacing it with the Hard Rock.  Either way great experience Thank You!
50,We were here for a bachelorette trip! It was very clean! The restaurants inside are really good 10/10 recommended The Pantry. The only thing is it’s a little towards the end on the trip so we wish we would’ve stayed a little more central! But we still loved the hotel just be prepared to walk a little bit!
50,I’m no stranger to MGM properties and this was my first time staying at Mirage. The pool was amazing/relaxing the service was incredible and the room was comfortable! I wish it was in the center of the strip or I would stay here often!
50,In room dining was excellent!! Casino floor has enough tables and games. Pool was very spacious and easy to order a drink. Check out super easy and parking in and out privileges for $15a day . We saw Beatles Love!!!! Great show
50,We love staying here located in the middle of the strip you can go either way and see a ton of stuff. The decor sends the right kind of tropical vibe. Rooms are comfortable and usually you can get this resort at a great price
50,Went down with friends {5 couples total} we had a great time at the Mirage. Staff was friendly very clean through out. We rented a Cabana 1 day & had a fantastic time. Highly suggest the Mirage to anyone.
50,Enjoyed my stay! Each year I visit Las Vegas I plan to stay at a different hotel on the strip. This year I chose the Mirage simply because my brother loves this place and this has been his hotel of choice annually for the last 10 years that I know of. Clean beautiful decor lots of eatery and shopping options very nice island style pool warm and welcoming staff. The Volcano night show is an awesome view to see as well. Sad to see it leave.
50,Great experience at the Mirage. Friendly and accommodating staff. Fun gambling with up-to-date slot machines. Ideal location in terms of the Las Vegas strip. Fantastic pool area with beautiful scenery and amazing waterfalls.
40,The hotel was very nice and the food was good lots of different options. The staff was helpful. The room was really sizable I liked that they had a lot of mirrors and space for your things. The pool was nice.
50,4th visit to Vegas and chose The icon mirage Hotel as it is a great hotel and with the news of the developments later this year wanted to ensure we had the chance to stay there and we were not disappointed. Room was fantastic huge with great views from the top floor. Had a great stay and would definitely recommend.
50,We had stayed at the Mirage before the pandemic and were happy to be back! The staff is so accommodating. Definitely noticed increased cleaning procedures. Food & service great we can’t wait to go back!
50,Super clean and friendly best place yet. Check in was easy and staff was polite and helpful. Rooms were really nice and clean! Even the cafe was good food and good customer service. Cute stores to go shopping in too! We will be back for sure!
10,No safe in room so chose to have no housekeeping for the duration for security of my valuables. Was offered a credit to my account and fees waived due to an inadequate room for other reasons as well. Was not told that it was a credit that would only apply to food and only if it was charged to the room. So I paid for food and drinks on my credit card expecting the credit on my final bill. Big surprise at checkout. With my only option to buy $30 drinks for other people as I left to use up the credit they failed to properly give me. This place can take a hike. I’ll take my business elsewhere next time.
10,I checked out and when I received detailed bill I was charged $200 for a bar tab at the pool that we didn’t even go to the pool. When I asked front desk they said the bar was closed for the day and I would have to wait till 9:00 am the next morning to speak with Uten the bar manager to get credited for it. I asked how it could charged to my room without id the manager told that they were supposed to have is before billing to room. I requested to see signature and he said the bar was the only location that kept the signature and he could access them. I told him my flight leaves before the manager arrives. And he said he couldn’t do anything about without the bar manager approval and I would just have to call him from the airport. These charges were to my employer credit card and could cost me my job of 32 years and the hotel could care less about that. Ii would expect more from a general manager of a hotel of this size.
30,Staff was depressing the pool closes at 5pm and you can't use the fridge in your room for anything. Our stay was nice otherwise. Volcano was unique and cool to watch. Central location. We were also able to check in a bit early and the checkin was a fairly quick process which was nice.
40,Great price for the room it was spacious and the front desk was very helpful. The digital key on the app is very handy. The rooms are very clean don’t smell like smoke especially because I get headaches so that was a plus
40,Everything was great! Rooms were clean and rooms were serviced everyday. I think the only thing that went wrong was that I lost at the casino. Lol and the walk to toom was pretty long. If you get a room on the fair end you are in for a 200 meter walk to your room just from the elevator. Overall good stay though.
50,Friendly staff and very helpful. Very nice view of the pool area. Gaming tables were fairly priced depending on your budget. Lots of slots with different games. Again there is a price range for all budgets.
50,The mirage resort was phenomenal! We really enjoyed ourselves and definitely one of the best resorts in Vegas! Looking forward to coming back soon!! Always appreciate good customer service from anywhere but the mirage customer service was well exceptional! Thanks guys! Keep up the great work!!!
10,Pearl Status gets free parking. We are Pearl and had to pay for parking three times $12 $12 & $15. TV non Functional for three days. Talked to Priority Check-In about parking and gave them the three paid parking stubs. They said they issued $89 food credit $39 for parking and $50 for the non working TV. We had $100 food credit the front desk said we now had $189 food credit. Charged $189 to room for actual food and paid the difference to the steak house. Now the Mirage went and charged the $89 to my credit card. You can not call and talk to the Mirage as they do not take calls it has to be done online by filling out forms and wait a few weeks.
40,the mirage was a nice stay and i liked the location for the event i was in town for. The pool was nice and the restaurants and options were nice as well. The game tables had a few good dealers. i would def return.
50,I had a great experience at this hotel using the MGM Rewards app i was able to book my room got an early check in option and used mobile checkin to avoid lines! The hotel was clean and up to date. Staff was friendly and efficient! Will definitely stay again.
50,I usually stay at Caesars resorts but I received an invitation for a room and free play. I decided to change and glad I did. The hotel still looks fresh and new. The room was very nice and comfortable.  Sometimes change is good.  We decided to eat at Stacks. We ordered appetizers and drinks at the bar since the wait time for a table was longer than we wanted to wait. The food was good as well as the drinks. We ordered the lobster tacos Calamari shrimp cocktail and broccolini. He bartenders were friendly and made our dining a positive experience.  All in all we enjoyed our stay at Mirage and will return soon.
50,You won’t be disappointed! Great value with all you gambling game needs! Lots and lots of machines. Plenty of blackjack tables and everything else! Rooms were comfy and clean and the pool was big as well!
10,Not worth the price many hotels nearby are newer and cleaner for the same price. Won’t be returning. Sauna was a $30 charge and was not working. Additionally I paid $18 for a water bottle sorry but that’s just too much.
50,My boyfriend and I wanted a decent hotel at a decent price. We definitely loved our stay and would go back again! We came for an event by Circus Circus and we were able to walk back in 30 minutes (granted our feet did hurt).
10,It was an awful experience. From the mini-bar that I was not been warned off and told after that the almost hidden sign should’ve been enough warning to not use this refrigerator. Up to a broken fan in the bathroom that couldn’t be fixed within the 3 day stay… horrible experience. To top it off I emailed Freddy Estrella (Hotel Operations Manager) twice with 0 feedback. It’s one thing to not agree with a customer but it’s another level to ignore them!
50,Perfect location in the middle of the strip. Walking distance to the top night clubs. Phenomenal staff friendliness and always glad to help. Although I could tell from standing in the hall that the room next door was playing music; once inside my room I could not hear the music at all. The quality of sleep was the best.
40,Extremely dated but clean. Our room was fine nothing to write home about. I was pleasantly surprised to have a bathtub! Mini bar is stupid just give us a fridge! Food options aren't great - when starbucks is the best you know that things are weird. Paradiso (clothing store) was a surprise - found the best party dress in my size! That was fun. Pool is nice.
50,Celebrating 47th wedding anniversary just as we have in year's past.We love the Oasis pool & spend alot of the day there enjoying music great food service & just ambiance of all tropical plants around pool.Only pool where you can feel your relaxing on tropical island. We were given several gift cards from family & friends for dinner out.We always ate lunch by the pool & Danielle always got our orders correct no matter how much we asked for extra this or not that.We found it hard to keep track of when Mirage restaurants were opened because some were opened only certain hours or days.Room was wonderful & ready when we got there before noon.Hubby felt like that was a bonus present.Room attendants were always kind & helpful.We sure hate to see this resort change .It will with The Hard Rock taking over this summer.A trip this fall might be all different.Plus Southwest is starting new program with seating costs & availability. At least we had one more fabulous stay at Mirage.Hubby wanted to see Beatles Show for fourth time.He can you each they time they revamped show & how it just keeps getting better.
20,Had a suite for business meetings. upon arrival noticed food various places on the floor. Shower still had hair in it! Would not stay there if it wasn't where the meeting must take place. Casino pool are nice.
50,Was a great stay had an excellent time from the check in to the stay. We partook in a bunch of different activiteis and ate at several of the hotels resturaunts. Would highly recomment to anyone looking to have a great stay. Didnt win at their casino despite spending a good bunch of money but was able to make it back in old town and at Casino Royal across the street. Otherwise highly recommend
40,While the hotel is slightly dated it's iconic and smack dab in the middle of the Vegas strip with a great view. The volcano show was awesome! Only down side was the pool closes earlier than most other hotels.
20,Sad to say this stay was not a good one the room smelled and was not clean.. hope they can step it up and correct these issues because we love the pool here and have made many trips here over the years. The nicest rooms are in the new renovation facing the strip
40,Mirage kicked off the modern era of Las Vegas strip resorts 33 years ago. It has been bought and will re-emerge as a Hard Rock hotel. We enjoyed one last stay before the changes to come.    I had a comped room but was given a chance to pay for a “penthouse suite” to a room of about 1200 square feet. Which was more than we needed but totally worth it. Beautiful spacious with many classic touches. Mirage is at a great location. Beautiful comfortable has everything you need. Well maintained and run.    We will miss you!
40,Great pool and service there. Horrible drink service in Casino. Great location and liked choices of restaurants. Our beds were comfortable and special Stay Well rooms were a nice touch. Not too huge so could find your friends easily!
30,Firstly the room was not real clean. The carpet is of a dark color and I could see white specs hair nails etc. on it.  Also my reservation said I should be getting FREEPLAY but I never did. In fact I did not get any FREEPLAY during my stays at any of the MGM properties in the last two years even though my reservations say I should be.  Lastly they charged my incidentals twice once at check-in and again at check-out. I did not find out until I got home. Now  I have to deal with my Cc company. What a hassle!
10,Room was not cleaned daily (I did not opt out). Room was outdated and did not have access to media such as Netflix/Hulu etc.. very slow customer service when I was locked out of my room due to hotel error. Room service for dinner was very fast so that was a positive but there was no coffee in the hotel room.
30,Although we had issues not getting the room we reserved they were able to provide us with a rollout bed. A horrible experience once we walked in our room we noticed the room was not actually ready or cleaned. We had to leave the room so they could have it cleaned. They offered us a $50 food credit for our troubles. I feel they could have done much more than that.
50,Started for for nights very convenient and beautiful. Parking was easy at treasure island since they gave a Tram connected saved me some money until I get my MGM pearl status. Pool was great and beautiful too bad all Vegas pools seem to close early at like 5pm.
40,Beautiful hotel great service and location! Glad I got to stay at least once knowing it’ll be gone in the future! Loved the Aces of Comedy show and the front desk staff were helpful with getting us a room early check in and tickets to our show!
50,The Mirage was a great experience. The bars restaurants entertainment was great. No need to leave the Hotel. The room was newly remodeled super big quality bed tv and quiet. Shower was hot and full power. Overall 5 stars.
40,Loved the atmosphere at the Mirage. The atrium was stunning and we loved the Secret Garden sanctuary. The rooms were nothing special and we didn't have the best view but overall it wasn't too bad. All but one of the restaurants closed early in comparison to the rest of the strip which did make getting a late night meal more difficult.
50,My daughter and I decided to continue celebrating Mother's Day and decided to stay at the Mirage. Friendly staff fabulous pool great poolside service great room and nice restaurants. The tropical atmosphere added to our relaxation. Highly recommend the Mirage.
50,I have a service dog and I’ve never felt so welcomed at a hotel! The staff was very kind and accommodating and I never once felt like I wasn’t welcome. They have a great doggie area out front. Overall it was wonderful!
50,This Classic Casino has been my #1 go-to for years. Great location on strip. Staff is friendly and accomodating. Highly recommended casino to visit and try your luck at while this place still stands and gets it's mark in the history books!
40,The rooms have been beat up and need some love and a deep clean. The shower tub combo was really dirty. The toilet seat was falling off the toilet. The air conditioner wouldn't keep the room cool. BUT we got comp rooms and a reduced room rate so after the resort fees we paid something like 45.00 for the comp nights and 145.00 for the reduced rate night. It was worth the 45.00 but I would of been pissed if I paid over 100 a night. The hotel staff was super friendly and it was easy to get coffee in the morning. I never once had someone ask me if I wanted a drink while gambling but we only gambles for 4/5 hours. The pool was nice but we rented chairs because we didn't want to fight for a chair to sit in. On saturday we paid 100.00 per chair and sunday 60.00 per chair
50,5 days at the mirage had a great time. First trip in 2 years. Can't wait for to make a return trip. Spent plenty of time in inviting pool. Dining was great at several of the wonderful restaurants. Staff in all areas of the facilities was great everyone was very accommodating and friendly.
50,Every member of the staff at the Mirage and the shops and restaurants was courteous and friendly. My only complaint is that the room wasn't well cared for - looks like they aren't investing in that because of the upcoming change over to Hard Rock.
50,Perfect for a guys getaway. Rooms were available right away. Some folks like to nicpick but for a Bed & Shower 1 really can't wine. Food & drinks were high we knew that coming in. Eat off the strip.
50,Our room was clean and comfortable. Our breakfast at Snack was very good and affordable with the BOGO award from MyVegas game. We went to the Beatles Love for the 4th time! The location is great good selection of slot machines and table games. Staff is very friendly and helpful.
50,Great time as always. Pools. Slots and great eating. Awesome time with wonderful staff and great people. The ambiance is just what you need. Whether its 1 day or 1 week it’s nothing but great memories.
50,You cant find any property that has the feel that the mirage provides. It feels like your in a tropical paradise! Everything is so close together. Short walks from garage to lobby lobby to hotel hotel to casino restaurants pool theaters...everything is just a short walk. This property is amazing!
50,Me and my wife had an amazing time we got married and out of all the times staying there this was one of the best times even with the company changing buildings I will be sure to come back just to get the same service I had this time
40,Vegas luxury too bad it's been sold and destroyed. Fantastic pool area and easy mobile check in our room was ready before check in while another family we were travelling with stayed next door at Caesars and waited several hours after check in time for their rooms
50,The Mirage is a wonderful vacation destination. The casino & hotel rooms are kept very clean. There are many restaurant options as well. I can’t say enough good things about The Mirage. Highly recommend.
10,My car was stolen from the mirage parking structure. The security did not care about my security of my property. Took them a long time to help. Parked it at 4c and 1 hour later it was stolen. I had a tracker in the car. Thank the lord. My car has finally been recovered by metro vegas police 🙏🏽
50,Great facilities. Only issues the queues for the elevators up to the business suites and in general the pricing of catering packages. Saw more and more companies bringing in their own water snacks and iced coffee.
50,Excellent location on the strip pretty much next to everything Room was very clean. Beautiful property well taken care of. Very much enjoyed my stay here. Decent choices to eat Casino was a bit smoky but that's to be expected.
20,Service and cleaning were great. Beds hurt. WIfe needed a lot of advil and back rubs to sleep at all. woke up in bad pain.    Rooms were okay a bit small and cramped for 2 people trying to get dressed up for different events. 40 dollar fee for early check in and you can't use your mini fridge or touch any items on the snack table they have weight sensors that will auto charge you for bumping them.
50,Our experience was outstanding from check in to our accommodations to check out. The restaurants offered a wide variety of fare. The only drawback was the very limited choices late night. Our desk clerk Millie was the best.  Navigating the casino floor only took a short time to master.
50,Been staying at the Mirage for 30 years . Always a good experience . Seeing the same couple waitress every stay . Beatles Love  great show . Very helpful staff. Sad that it has been sold  hopefully I’ll have a few more trips before the name change.
50,professional yet personal help at the desk consignor  bell hop / baggage handler staff in restaurants and at the pool EVERYONE was amazing. our room was clean through out  bed comfy made our stay amazing . I would wholeheartedly recommend anyone to stay here.
50,I had a great experience staying in your hotel.  The hotel is well secured. The room have enough space. There are a lot of restaurants and stores to eat and to buy necessities needed. The casino is well lighted and directions are clear.
50,Trip was easy! Heritage Steak house was awesome. Pool is our favorite. Sports bar is our main place to hang out and gamble. Time in Vegas is always successful when coming home with money! For a quick trip to lay by the pool and gamble some.. Mirage is the place .
50,One of our favorite hotels to stay at in Vegas . Centrally located. It's a shame it is being sold. Probably our last stay since it's no longer a Mlife resort. The pool area is a great place to spend a relaxing afternoon.
40,When arriving in room there were wrappers from peanuts from mini bar that were open and no peanuts inside so I went down and showed a picture of the items as did not want to be charged for those items. They helped me and insured would be no charge. Was not good to have that in room when arriving tho.
50,Wonderful experience: well-maintained facilities and a very experienced staff made my stay a delight. Housekeeping was invisible and perfect in attention to detail. The steaks at Stack were perfectly prepared and presented rates a 5 star in my book.
50,It was my 3rd Stay at the Mirage and only my 4th trip ever to Vegas! The food is great. The machines are fun! My girls have a blast partying and playing craps!  Hope to be back before Hard Rock takes over!
50,I really love this casino its very clean fell safe and very good service you have to try it you can have a really good time here and it’s very close to everything I was in Vegas many times and visit many difrent hotels and this is one of my favorites
50,Great service and customer upon check in. I had a challenge with my original room and without pause or challenge the gentleman at the front desk that had checked me into my first was able to make a switch and the new room was just perfect!
50,We arrived checked in by a very helpful friendly gentleman who answered all my questions and guided us where we needed to go. Our room was very nice and clean and everyone we met was wonderful . We can’t wait to go back.
30,The Mirage has always been my favorite casino to play in so I chose it for my brother's bachelor party. Great accommodations. Friendly staff. Not happy about the $55 mini bar charge for stuff we didn't consume and I swear was never there. Serves me right for not taking a picture when we checked-in. I'll definitely be back to gamble but may find another hotel to stay at.
50,Excellent hotel clean nice casino & restaurants gift shops shark and lion exhibit. Rooms were clean and beds were comfortable. Had nice view of the strip too. Wish I wouldve had a car there. Didn’t get chance to use the pool. Next time.
50,We checked in on Thursday afternoon at 11am and the room was ready. Our room was spacious and clean. We wandered the strip close to our hotel as we did not have a car. We ate at California Pizza Kitchen located in our hotel and it didn’t disappoint. Later that evening we watched Love featuring The Beatles music and received a decent discount because we were staying at the Mirage. The ticket attendant was eager to give us great seats. That evening we got a late night snack at the 24 restaurant in the lobby. The next morning we rented a car from the lobby and off we went to explore Clark county Thank you Mirage for providing a hotel with all of the amenities and then some. Costumer service was wonderful from check-in to house keeping to restaurants to sports books attendant to valet and finally rental car attendant . Oh and the website was user friendly too.
40,We had a great stay at the Mirage! Staff was great pool was beautiful. Only negatives were the bathroom were quite small and there were no outlets by the bed stands. Would have expected some of the room amenities to be nicer but overall very happy with out say.
50,The hotel was beautiful. I was amazed by the atrium and the cleanliness. awesome restaurant with reasonable prices open 24 hours. Some great shops to purchase souvenirs without breaking the bank. My only complaint was the was was no microwave and the fridge was fully stocked so you couldn’t use it without being charged.
30,Don't ask the Pit Bosses for any type of comp unless you spend an average of $100 per play. I lost thousands each day for 3 days. Asked for a pack of cigarettes and i was going to buy them from the cocktail waitress. They weren't available so I asked for them to be comped. They said no I didn't spend enough.
50,"The Mirage welcomed us with a fresh tropical smell as we walked in the door. Every employee was extremely friendly. The hotel and casino were very clean the beds were very comfortable and we felt very safe during our stay. We loved having 24 hr options for food. We are broken hearted hearing the hotel has been sold and will soon be Hard Rock and the volcano will be taken out. The volcano ""show"" was a nice free event that made us proud to be staying at the hotel. If you have the chance to stay at the Mirage before it is rebranded to Hard Rock DO IT! You will not be disappointed."
30,Was very disappointed with this years stay. We were there for 8 nights and on the last 2 days we did not get our room clean. Had to call for clean towels and to remove wet towels and trash. Stayed here many years but never had this bad experience before.
50,The hotel had everything we wanted from eatery choices to pools and dolphins beautiful gardens and nice size clean rooms. I would definitely stay there again.  The only suggestion that I would have is that they have a coffee maker in the room.
20,I find charging for removing and replacing items from a mini frig ridiculous. A fee to use said frig for “personal storage”? What a waste of electricity and space. Its abhorrent. I chose a wellness stay room- and would think the entire experience would be consistent- junk food on counter and fees to use frig? How about put in a tea kettle and some herbal tea- really serve the people who want a wellness experience.
20,Rooms are very dated poorly maintain and things are falling apart. Also house cleaning isn’t good. Front desk people some have a bad customer service approach. I had to jump through all kinds of hoops and loops just to get my issues resolved. Eventually something was done but overall just too much of a hassle and stress.
40,This place is wonderful. We were very pleased with the location and the rooms. They have express elevators for the higher floors. Make sure you purchase a small cooler or locate one before it gets tossed. You will not be able to put anything in the fridge…it’s a mini-bar.
40,We had a blast. Staff dealers security everyone was super friendly. Our car was broken into in the parking garage and the hotel staff wasn't very helpful with that and our AC didnt work in our room- but everything else was great.
10,What can you expect. The strip is nothing but a money grabbing scam. Everything is fake. It’s a facade. It’s all designed to keep you front of price tags. There’s no substance. Stay downtown on Freemont.
10,We had to change rooms 4 times. 1st room the bed was broken 2nd and 3rd rooms bathrooms had hair and gunk on toilets and showers had mildew and dirty. 4th room then bathroom was  Clean(we think someone went in and cleaned before they let us in) however dust all on the headboard chair had  Stains on it white atuff(use your imagination) on the bed frame and skirt and one of the end tables. Carpet  Filthy and this was the cleanest of the 3 previous rooms. We were  Promised a one night stay credit and food credit which didn’t happen and now somehow we were charged more than the initial booking. Let me add this was our honeymoon stay of 7 days. Absolutely ruined!!!
50,Good experience. Wish it wasn’t becoming Hard Rock Cafe. Hotel is beautiful and the staff is wonderful. I may come back to Vegas and if I do this year I’ll for sure be back at this property. Greatest experience
50,Centrally located  Clean rooms  Excellent service  We got our room for reward points and it was amazing. I love the grounds it feels so tropical - true to its name a beautiful mirage in the Nevada desert.
50,Great hotel. Everything I needed was in the hotel. Nice casino. Comfy beds. Good Wi-Fi. Great dining. Friendly staff. Yeah I would stay here again. Great value. No need for me to even leave the property.
30,Room temperature showed 65 on thermostat but room was stuffy. Being a disabled veteran I didn't like how far my room was from the elevator. Also room did not have an alarm clock. I did love the variety of restaurants and scenery.
40,Bathroom had rust around the tub and the resort needs updating. Pool was great. Did not get drink service really while gambling even when we tipped. Good at the restaurants was good. Especially at California pizza
20,This place as with many of the MGM hotels is in desperate need of a refresh/reno. Since Hard Rock will be doing this in 2023 I won't be staying here again until that happens. I'll go back to Aria as it's pretty much the best MGM has to offer.
30,this hotel i stay at alot until now. this last trip was not so great. room was really wrinkled and had a large tear. we got bothered by maintence but to possible leak-room next door. we did not get the room we wanted. this place had great food choices. the rooms are run down though they need renovation. and for the cost you can stay somewhere else nicer. i hear from locals Hard Rock bought it so yeahmaybey it will get a good reno. lots of changs coming and this hotel really needs it.
50,Celebrated 3 birthdays as well as Mothers Day. Always have a positive experience at the Mirage I get great comps here and the Diablo restaurant was a wonderful addition. We lucked out and arrived Cinco de Mayo. Diablo had some great entertainment and the food and drinkx top notch.
50,Was really a great time and staff was there for anything we needed! It was our first time in Vegas and we honestly couldn't have asked fo4 a better welcoming. Thank you Mirage Hotel and Staff see you all next time!
20,Very poor view of the top of a parking garage. As well as the heat of the room. I think it was set at 75.but the thermostat showed 65 but there was no way it was that cold. The room was ok the beds were nice but there were definitely ways for improvement.
40,The Mirage is a nice resort. It’s in the center of the strip and walking distance from planet 13. The staff was fast delivery for extra towels we needed. You have about 5 different restaurants to choose from and they are all good choices. Also to mention reasonable prices
30,Hotel has been sold maybe this is why the condition of room was not as expected having stayed there before bathroom in need of repair. Visual dust on furniture and headboard. Additional staff at check is required when there is a long line up.
40,Great hotel in a great location. There are lots of options for eating and there are some good shows playing there. But the hotel is starting to show its age. I would definitely stay there again - unless you are staying in a suite don't expect luxury.
20,The overall casino is still nice and the grounds a decent but the rooms are in desperate need of a renovation and refresh. The bathroom needed to be overhauled and there was a lot of chipped paint and scuffed furniture. I was hoping for a better view and told the Mountain View was the best there was but it wasn't great.
40,Luckily the people who checked us in warned us not to even touch the snacks and water in the room to avoid the $18 per water charge and the who-knows-what charge for the snacks! They are on a sensored platform that will automatically charge you if anything is even moved. And forget about using the mini-fridge - same deal - if you touch anything in it or try to put any of your own drinks or food into it you will be charged. Beware! It's insane. We just wanted to put our leftovers from the restaurant and some bottles of water in there. Nope. Also there is no coffee maker in the room so every morning you must schlep yourself down to Starbucks and stand in line.
50,I enjoy my stay the food the beach and the drinks. The people were charming and hard working. They will go out of their way always to meet satisfaction. Please please people even if it’s a couple of dollars tip your staff! Take lots of one-dollar bills for tipping; the people are happy with whatever is given because they only make the country's minimum wage of $2.50 an hour. Shout out to Noemi Raul Mendez Antony Carlos Yacaira the books the bartenders custodian staff room service and everybody at the resort! Every one amazing!  Michelly Maldonado
50,everything from the moment we arrived was amazing! well recommend!! enjoyed the stay and how easy it was to get checked in right away through the mobile app. loved the casino experience and the staff.
10,The room in general is fine for a $100 room. Problem is it was $400 a night so the expectations go up. Big problem was the AC wouldn’t cool the room to under 75. I need it cooler than that to sleep comfortably. Set the thermostat to 65 only cooled to 75. It ran the whole time but no cold air. Left me sweating and just generally uncomfortable. I expect to be able to set the temperature in the room to something in the mid 60’s. The room was very clean. Decor nothing special and appears a bit dated. Bathroom is fine but door should have a lock. Nothing luxurious about it. In general a real disappointment for the price.
50,I had never been to Vegas so I googled place in middle of the strip. The location of the Mirage is absolutely perfect. I was able to walk both sides of the strip enjoy features and restaurants of neighboring hotels and make it back and forth to the hotel multiple times during the day. The pool was amazing relaxing and very clean! The rooms were spacious and the beds were very comfy! The restaurant choices within the Mirage were amazing! We discussed in hindsight we never had to actually leave the hotel we would have been absolutely pleased with everything offered within the Mirage! The choices of food drinks and casino games were vast and exceeded expectations! The customer service was amazing. The front desk staff restaurant members pool area workers luggage personnel…all beyond friendly and overly helpful! Would definitely recommend!!!
50,The casino was constantly being cleaned. The rooms were great as well. I loved the view of the volcano at night. The pool was lovely but be sure to reserve a spot or get there early to get a seat. The restaurants were delish as well.
30,After a somewhat terrible stay last year at The Mirage I given a fairly good deal last fall and took advantage of it and stayed last week to celebrate my 55th birthday and 25th wedding anniversary. We love the tropical theme and the great pool the Mirage has so that's why it's one of the resorts we try to frequent even though it has lost some of its luster.    When the offer was made we were to upgraded to a Stay Well room and was told-that it would be inspected by housekeeping management before our arrival. We checked in around 11 am fairly quick considering the line and were told that we would be informed when the room is ready and to stand in the line reserved for higher tier M Life reward members when I come back. After getting a quick lunch at The Pantry which has never let me down I got a text my room was ready and I went to designated spot I was told to stand in. A older man with a gray jacket was checking for the proper M Life cards to make sue you're supposed to be in that special line and rudely asked what I was doing there? I explained what I had been told and he then again rudely said to me that the front desk doesn't know their **** from shinola and yes he actually said that and was rude as can be. He then took me over to the self check in and showed me the spot where I can self check in and have our cards made. Why did the front desk tell me to stand there in the first place? We went up to our room and it seemed ok with the exception of a bunch of dirty spots in the carpet. We called bell services retrieved our luggage and went about starting our Vegas vacation. It wasn't until later when retuning to clean up and head out to get some dinner we found out the bathtub drain was clogged and there's nothing like having stand in dirty water from the previous person when trying to shower and it start to run over the edge of the tub. It was then we also discovered that the toilet was slow flushing/clogged and this was supposed to be a room that checked by the housekeeping supervisor??    I found the staff to non helpful for the most part with the exception of the nice woman from the front desk who issued us another room on the same floor and gave us a small dinning credit for our inconvenience of packing up or room and making a late night switch. I asked if there was any room upgrades available since I was making a room switch anyway and was offered a room for $600 dollars more a night. No thanks. Anyway after about 45 minutes we were in our new room which wasn't that much cleaner but thankfully everything worked. Still a sour taste was left in our mouths from the rudeness we encountered and the late night room switch. We found that the beds in the Stay Well rooms were very hard and not what we were used too and made for some poor sleep. The next morning after breakfast again at the Pantry I tried talking to the front desk and was basically stonewalled in any attempt to get a better bed. I asked if the was anything they could do and I don't remember the beds being that hard. He was completely useless and non helpful and I gave up at that point as I wasn't going to pay another 2000K for a room with better sleeping options. We just pushed through it the rest of the week and made it work and pure exhaustion of walking around on the strip helped deal with the rock hard beds.    The pool was great as usual and some great down time was had by everyone in my party. Most of the staff I encountered with the exception of those working in The Pantry were cold and no help. You couldn't find and get a cocktail waitress to serve you any drinks while gambling. We started gambling at other casinos at this point and the service we received at the Circa was amazing and the staff at the Mirage could learn a few things from what we seen at the Circa. Mandalay Bay treated us better than the Mirage too and the other couple who joined us on our trip all agreed as well. We left after 5 days and said goodbye to the Mirage and hopefully with the upcoming change to the Hard Rock it will be a much better resort.
40,Staff was very helpful and friendly rooms are a little bit outdated but clean. Check in was easy. The casino floor was a good size not to big to get lost in. The pool was beautiful. Bars are in great spots and the girls bringing the drinks to the games are great
50,We always stay at the Mirage in Las Vegas and we go there twice a year! The Mirage is like our “home away from home”. We have heard that it has been sold and we are not looking forward to finding a new MGM hotel to call home when we visit Vegas!
50,Was amazing! Rooms were very nice and clean staff was great!! Was upgraded without a problem and ended up with a great view!! We loved it!! 🥰 Would definitely love to stay here again!!! We had a great time! Can’t wait to come to Vegas again for the 4th time we come every year from Michigan!
50,Nice stay at the mirage my family was comfortable I enjoyed our penthouse suite clean and lots of amenities easy check in and check out on the MGM app highly recommend we were able to check in on the way there and get a digital key and head straight to our room upon arrival. Kids enjoyed the volcano and the secret garden and dolphin habitat. Wish we had time to check out the pool it looked really cool.
50,Mirage hotel. Is laid out nicely. I got more than i expected. Clean. Uodated. Easy to maneuver around nice beds and room layout. We had our kids. Easy parking. Saw a show. Had dinner. Great time “note:if you have oversize car you can park with valet guys for 35$ cash”.
50,Easy check in and check out. Paid for early check in and received a super upgrade so we were able to get access to our room by 9am. Our room was amazing and had a super view! Very clean and well equipped with all necessities.
20,Nice hotels but someone completely dropped the ball with making sure room 15116 restroom was cleaned. My shower was so filthy that I just took a bird bath to prepare myself for a wedding I also had to kill a roach in my restroom
30,Check out was very difficult. Our room was not replenished with toilet paper or towels had to make 2 requests before getting extra blankets. Layout of the hotel was difficult to navigate to the elevator with our luggage.
40,The hotel was beautiful. All of the staff was nice. They don’t tell you about the $300 deposit until your checking in though! Only thing I did not like is that you can’t store your drinks or anything in the fridge in the room or they will charge you $50 which is ridiculous because I paid $1000 to stay there! Also we couldn’t bring any food back(left overs) because there’s no microwave.
50,Everything from the staff to the cleanliness to the service was amazing. The pool is the best on the strip. The location of the hotel is perfect. You could literally never leave the hotel and still have an amazing time. The dolphins exhibit was interactive and informative and reasonably priced.
50,"Wonderful all around! Clean and quiet rooms with comfortable beds. Nice staff ~ Right in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip. The Hotel and grounds are beautiful! I hope so much it will stay ""The Mirage"""
50,The Mirage is an amazing place and I would like to come back. Although the hotel is a bit old it still shines brighter with many of its competitors around it. Everyone was amazing in helping me with anything I needed.
50,Great Hawaiian vibe in a great strip location. Loved the tropical flowers waterfalls volcano great restaurants close by to reach around the casino. Got help from front desk getting a room by the elevador
50,The location is amazing the staff will treat you as if you are a valued customer. The pool is suburb definitely recommend getting a cabana. Makes the experience that much better.  Diablos is also in the Mirage and has great food.
50,This is one of the most beautiful properties on the strip. Classy entrance and the best check in backdrop ever.  Outstanding pool area. We rented a cabana. The cabana environment was excellent. Way in the back quiet stocked snack and soft drinks. Easy access to the pool deck but out of the crowd if you like. Easy access to the Duce north and south bound.  not enough craps tables. Good quarter video poker area. Relaxing sports book.  RIP
50,All the staff including housekeeping was top drawer!  Restaurants were wonderful and the Beatles show was very enjoyable. I only wish that that pesky resort and parking fees are scrapped or significantly lowered I hate seeing these fees on my closing statement.
50,Love mirage. Dorothy on casino floor is super sweet. Please don't let Hardrock change the pool. it is so gorgeous back there and we love the Dole whipped pineapple! We are so sad to lose this beautiful Hawaiian theme hotel. Also the cheeseburger in the restaurant near Starbucks is the most amazing cheeseburger I ever ate!!!
20,The rooms are outdated and the showers did not drain well. I had to be careful to not stand in dirty water when showering. The staff was very friendly and put me in another room. But it had the same issue. I gave up complaining.
40,You can tell they are going to do just enough until Hard Rock implodes the property rightly so. Rooms need some attention to detail paint stained furniture etc. The staff was great! Seeing the iconic volcano one more time was a highlight Seeing a giant guitar hotel is going to be different for sure.
40,The whole trip was great no real issues except buying a 16 ounce can of monster for 7 dollars lol… will always stay at MGM properties going forward just makes vacation relaxing and care free… First time at mirage and I will def go back food was great good atmosphere and very friendly staff
50,This is my favorite go to at this part of the strip along with New York New York at another part of the strip. This facility is much nicer and cleaner and the staff is more friendly here. I will return several times a year. Thank you!
50,This was a super great place! We enjoyed our stay here very much! Very chill vibes and eveything was a 10. So many great things to do on the property but my wife's favorite was definitely the dolphin area. Be sure to check that out. For me honestly I dont know why but the sauce on the breakfast burrito at Pantry was very memorable. I'd go back for it. Dang good sauce.
50,Very enjoyable vacation trip to celebrate our Wedding anniversary. We hopefully will be back next month to visit the Mirage to celebrate a birthdaycatch an evening show at the Beatles Love theater after enjoying a delicious dinner at Stacks........
40,AC doesn’t work very well. It doesn’t stay on. Seems to have some sort of timer that shuts it off after a while. Got hot even at night. Yea. I know it’s Vegas. But I’ve had other rooms there that were not as hot with AC on
50,Went to the Mirage at the end of April and the beginning of May. We stayed at the Penthouse suite and it was amazing. Large clean and relaxing. The view was also amazing of the strip. The pool was also fantastic and very active. One of the best locations and a very easy walk to the adjacent properties for food and shopping
50,Always stay at the Mirage. Will miss it when it changes to Hard Rock. Polite staff clean rooms fun place to stay in the middle of the strip! Great restaurants with top notch food and wait staff. Great pool!
50,Never really thought of staying here nor visiting. One day decided to check it out and realized I had no idea what I was missing all this time. It has a nice tropical jungle feel as you walk in place feels fresh and the vibe was amazing overall. We had a great stay here people were attentive service was top notch and overall we enjoyed ourself. The disappointment is Hard Rock Cafe bought this piece of history over and refurbishing it. So the disappointment of history from the 60s going into something else.
50,This was a perfect stay for us never had a single problem and everyone treated us very well. the room was super clean and spacious the shower was large and the best part of the room from my point of view.
50,The mirage is our favorite place to stay in Las Vegas. We love the gorgeous pool and all the beautiful landscaping/waterfalls. The atrium is beautiful and their signature scent inside is wonderful. I know it's going away in favor of the Hard Rock renovation and I couldn't be more sad about it.
50,Asked about an upgraded room (from resort King) and accepted one bedroom tower suite. Beautiful room spacious comfy bed. Nice to have jacuzzi tub and refrigerator. Room was very clean. The property itself is clean. Staff was helpful and friendly. Drink service on casino floor was slow but the waitresses were nice.
10,You people charged me for the stuff in the fridge and on the counter and nothing was touched or missing I don’t know how you can honestly charge people for things when nothing was missing just because the door was open
40,We had a great view a d the bed was very comfortable. The room was very dated. The loveseat was very uncomfortable. The pool was freezing cold. On the other hand the staff was great and very accommodating. Also all our meals were very good. We ate at The Paradise Cafe The Still Snack and Osteria.
40,Great experience. Everyone that was working was very pleasant and happy to be of assistance. The only downside was that not all the restaurants were open the days I was there. The only place that was open both nights of my stay was the expensive steak restaurant of the bar that would make bar food. One night I ended up at the Italian restaurant but had to sit at the restaurant bar to eat my dinner.
20,You reserve a room they decide to give you a different one room because is not available any room. Why reserve then? Not what we expected for our first time being at The Mirage and without our kids. .
50,Check in was easy. Our room was perfect and very clean. The hotel is very tropical and the pool area is huge. It is also very convenient to Caesar’s Shops. We have stayed at the Mirage before and will again.
50,This place was actually really fun has that nostalgic luxury to it. Love walking in and feels and smells like a rain forest! The pool was nice did the dolphin and tiger exhibit bc why not! Had more fun here than I thought I would’ve and I’m sad to know that it will be going away to build a big party hotel. This place is a classic and if you haven’t gone or stayed you should before it gone. Tables were fun food options were good location was great.
50,Staying 3 nights at the Mirage was s Very Positive experience for our family. Rooms were nice and the restaurant called “The Pantry” was great too. Good central location on the strip. The Dolphin/Lion exhibit is just fair...liked the pool service people were pleasant. There weren’t many lounge chairs open so we got a cabana for $350 and it was money very well spent for our family! I’ll always get that in the future. Walked next door to see Mystere at Treasure Island and across the street for the High Roller. Helicopter ride with Maverick helicopters was great. Went downtown for zip line and that area is not as family oriented...
50,The Mirage was awesome. The room was nice bathroom was small. Great resort hotel and location. We had a great time and I would recommend staying there to all of my friends. See you soon. Friendly staff and great places to eat.
40,I have stayed at The Mirage many times and it is still a great place to stay in Vegas but the ventilation system needs upgrading. Being there made me long for a non-smoking casino. If you don't mind the smoke then I highly recommend The Mirage.
50,I stayed at the Mirage from April 24 to May 12022. The staff was wonderful rooms were clean food was excellent. I spent 2 days at the private pool which was great. Seth was very nice and did an excellent job . My host Willie was excellent and he is the best host making sure that everything was take care of. I love the Mirage and will definitely go back.
50,My wife and I have stayed at the mirage several times over the years we absolutely love the pool area. The mirage is also centrally located on the strip. We have enjoyed many shows at the mirage. Many great places to eat.
50,Awesome celebrated 20year anniversary. Definitely needed mare time to experience all of what the Mirage had to offer. Will be back soon to enjoy to the fullest. Invite more guests to come along. Always a pleasure to stay at the Mirage.
50,I love the Mirage and have stayed there l0 times. Housekeeping staff is great quick check in and clean room. However I do not understand why Cravings is permanently closed for over 2 years as most of the buffets on the strip have reopened. I took my Mom there and she loved it.    Also please do not tear down the Volcano. It is such a tropical and unique property on the strip.
50,We always enjoy staying at the Mirage. We go every year in April for our anniversary! Love the slot machines and the sports book for gambling. We enjoy going to the pool and having drinks and relaxing. All the restaurant’s to choose from is wonderful. Everyone is so helpful and hotels is so clean. Love every minute of our 4 night stay! Thank you
50,me and the husband loved it there our first time in Vegas to bad the hotel will be gone by July 1!! we will be back in Vegas again  we had so much fun!! they have so much stuff to do and 5 days you can't do everything!!
50,Everything from arrival to checking in to getting our rooms were wonderful very welcoming.Our rooms very comfortable roomy and clean. Restaurants clean good food and relaxing. Casino nice clean light lots of different machines to chose from could use a few more people to serve drinks. Would go back again
50,Staff were courteous all restaurants were in full operation the casino floor was busy the valet was awesome. We stayed here as an MGM member but mainly because we heard this hotel was sold and they would changing the name. We have been coming to Vegas for years and always stay at a different MGM hotel to get a new experience in the same city.    We were a bit disappointed in two things:  1) the volcano was not active but high winds caused that.  2) the pool area staff were not real friendly and the poolside cafe was not busy all seats on the patio were open yet they would not allow us to sit on the patio to buy drinks unless we were having lunch.
40,We have always loved staying at the Mirage! It's one of the older hotels on the strip but you can't beat the location! Our trip was the beginning of April we had a great time! The hotel grounds & rooms were clean the employees were pleasant and they have good places to eat in the hotel. And the pool was as beautiful as ever! The only issue we had was using the app and self check-in. But we went to the front desk and got keycards and had no issues after that. We will miss the Mirage but look forward to see what Hard Rock will do with this property.
50,We checked in via the app printed room keys ourselves at a kiosk and went to our room. Very clean spacious and the bathroom was plenty big. The Mirage is very well maintained and we thoroughly enjoyed our 4 night stay. Our room was on the 25th floor with express elevator service.
50,First time at Mirage and we got a lovely volcano view room. Beautiful rooms great hotel in fact. Pool was fun too... not heated but stunning pool area. Sadly this hotel will become Hard Rock in the near future :(
50,It’s always a great experience from the rooms to the overall look of the hotel. I come back every year. The location and layout are very conducive to an experience that’s one of the best. The pool area is very tropical feeling.
50,Loved our stay at the Mirage !! Great view from our room  friendly staff beautiful atrium!!loved Shin Lim and Colin Cloud !!! Highly recommend that show ! Good restaurant choices  GREAT POOL Thank You!!!!
40,My checkin was not enjoyable. My husband and I have linked Mlife. When the teserbation was made it was under his name and I was told it would be no problem. Well they almost wouldn't let me check in.
40,Ok overall only half of the restaurants were open and no buffet open which is understandable due to Covid. Our room was clean but the carpet was in need of replacement. Location is very good within walking distance to other hotels.
40,I took my daughterfor her 21st birthday! I chose the Mirage because I have stayed their before and it's a beautiful place! The location on the strip is awesome! The room was very nice but the air conditioner could have been better! Overall we had a wonderful time!
50,Everything was first class. The staff through out the facility were always courteous and helpful. Facility was clean well maintained! Definitely would stay here again and recommend to friends. Central location!
50,It was a wonderful time and everyone was so friendly! We went for a long weekend and we were not disappointed. Everything was clean and although we didn't personally use the pool it looked wonderful. The shops were nice and the employees were very helpful! I would definitely stay here again!
50,"The Mirage was the 1st hotel we stayed at on our 1st visit in 1992 so it has great meaning for my sister & I. We had been planning this trip for quite awhile & were supposed to come in January but postponed due to the ""surge"" in Covid & were very disappointed. But we finally made it & it felt like coming home to us. We love the property & especially the people. Our host Chase Connoly is the best & since we met her in 07 at NYNY we have always gone where she is. Just to let you know how much this trip meant it was the 1st time in 2 1/2 years that I had left my apt & boy did it feel good. I want to thank you all for making this trip so wonderful."
50,I spent the majority of my visit in bed due to a pinched nerve. The housekeeping staff were very cooperative with cleaning around my situation. Hotel staff was very nice . We will definitely return soon. My husband enjoyed Vegas on his own pretty much. We will have to return to celebrate our 45th anniversary soon.
50,very nice hotel housekeeping came daily. The property was very clean. Check in was a breeze ! i would definitely stay here  again ! The location is good on the strip and close to shopping and other casinos. The pool is  very nice too. If you go in peak season
50,Service and staff were excellent. Miss the poker room buffet and pizza kitchen. Slots are old stale. Gift shop has no newspapers. Rating is based on staff and service. Some of the restaurants were not open. No 24 hour room service. Suite was clean and large. Housekeeping was excellent.
50,Easy and very fast check in. Extremely helpful front desk staff and the housekeeping staff were fantastic. Quiet rooms and everything in the room worked and it was very clean!  I miss the buffet! If you plan to dine at the restaurants at the Mirage get your name on their list early.
50,This trip was more for entertainment than for gambling although still got plenty of that. My Brother-in-law passed several months ago and my sister has been really depressed so my wife and I decided to take her to Vegas for her first time ever.  We did a lot of awesome shows like The Beatles Barry Manilow Extravganza V Ultimate Show Wax Museum. We also ate on top of the Stratishere Bacheral buffet Gilleys and 3 other restaurants at the Mirage.  We played table games at several Casino along with several slots
50,I always try to stay at the Mirage. The atmosphere the staff and the rooms are excellent. I received a text when I landed at 9AM that my room was ready which was very much appreciated. Also love that this hotel is within walking distance of other hotels. Definitely will stay there again!
50,Beautiful hotel and pool. The staff was helpful and the rooms were very nice and clean. Would love to stay here again. The dolphin and big cat secret garden was very nice and the animals seemed well cared for.
40,The location is very good and close to everything. The pool is beautiful and the rooms were nice. There are lots of good options but most are pricey. I wish they had a coffee maker and a usable refrigerator.
50,Had a wonderful time staying at the Mirage. Was in town for the NFL Draft the Staff was great room service was excellent. I very sad to see the Mirage is leaving so many great memories over the years of visiting the Mirage!!!
50,We had a great experience very easy to check in off my phone with email received. Went and printed my keys and it was just as easy. What was nice in my app had my digital key because I lost it at the pool. Pool was nice and clean; staff were helpful and fun. Checking out was just as easy again just used my app and DONE.
10,Front desk lady treated my elderly mom with extreme disrespect. No compensation for the terrible service. Accused me not paying for room. Took a few minutes to remove a hold on my card. If they look at our history of staying with mgm properties they would know how much money we spend in Las Vegas.
50,It was a nice experience staying at the mirage. First we got a redemption for the Vegas regards so it makes our rooms a good deal it was a nice and very comfortable bed Good service and fast very safe for my family to stay here
40,My wife’s first trip to Vegas we were guests of the Mirage. That was in the ‘90s. Since then I have visited often and stayed at other MGM properties but my wife’s favorite is Mirage.  Our last trip was wonderful as usual but It started out shakey at first. The room wasn’t what I was used to at their newer properties. I called to the front desk and was moved to another room which met my expectations.  After that all was great. The pool was beautiful as I remembered the location on the strip is second to none restaurants and service was excellent.  I am sorry that it is changing hands. This year we will be going a little farther south on the strip giving ip location for a suite snd a wave pool.  It was a great trip after all is said and done.
30,Just stayed 2 nights at the Mirage before now staying 2 nights at the Bellagio. Mirage has a great location and the pool area has a fun tropical feel. Everything else was just fine. Nothing wrong with it but you notice the difference between this hotel and the Bellagio right away. Rooms were fine but forgettable. Pool was very crowded to the point that it's tough to find chairs and often even space to sit on the edge of the pool. Casino was fine but again nothing special. I got this hotel with a $100 food and beverage credit for my 2 night stay and rooms were under $100 (before the ridiculous resort fee for nothing) so the price is right but there's no reason I'd stay here again over somewhere else unless it had the best price.
40,THE MIRAGE IS A SOLID 3.5 STAR HOTEL. CLEAN reasonable dining options. Casino is also neat and clean and safe. overall a great experience for family and friends. If you are looking for a more upscale experiemce then maybe Bellagio is better for you but the Mirage is a great Vegas resort.
50,Good location comfortable beds. Beautiful surroundings. We won money. Fun atmosphere. Plenty of pillows in room. Nice restaurants. However 'Resort Fee' is too high. They charge too much to view the Habitat.
50,We can stay anywhere but always choose the Mirage. It’s very clean and safe. The restaurant where we eat breakfast has the best food. We don’t get our room done and get our room cleaned but when we requested towels and items they were very nice about it and promptly bought them to our room
10,"mirage hotel is a real Mirage its a shame such a beautiful place can be full of workers so Mean jealous and inconsiderate that it ruins the Experience for its ""guest "" would Not want to Ever Stay there again~"
10,This was my first and last stay here at the mirage. the check in process was ridiculous the lady behind the counter was extremely rude and the room was beyond dirty with food and trash left in plain sight peeking out from under the bed.
50,"My sister and I came to Vegas for a quick weekend trip. The goal was to relax by the pool and go to Lady GaGa. This pool was absolutely perfect for us. It was large enough it didn't feel crowded it wasn't too loud although great music played we could relax and enjoy without the major ""party scene"" which was a nice break. we were very comfortable and satisfied."
50,We had great service at the Mirage. Check in was quick and easy. Staff was terrific. Room service was quick and delicious. When we needed anything in the room they were quick to respond. Wait staff at the pool was exceptional
50,The check in very easy. The staff is great. Lot's of nice food options all day long. Everything is really good. Excellent value and a great casino. The rooms are clean and fairly quiet for a crowded weekend. I recommend the Mirage as a great value.
30,Dated. A little rough. Was told we had a volcano view and did not. Pool is really cold. It was 90 out and barely anyone was in the pool cause it was ice cold. Beds were comfy though. Good location. Be interesting to see what it turns into
10,Room had trash in it. There was a dry hard towel stuck in shower pole no drinks in close vending machine. No housekeeping was done  was not satisfied with the room and needed to be dusted around tv and above bed. Room bad a strange smell
40,Good hotel and well located  Attending a Convention it was very conveniently located to the Convention site  Only problem that the restaurants are not open for service as before. Limited hours only and some of them are close after lunch
50,As always I wasn’t disappointed in our stay at the mirage. The staff are so friendly and so helpful when needed extra help. The restaurants and restaurant choices in the hotel are amazing and has the best food I have had in quite some time!
40,Almost darn near perfect easily 4.5 I only knock a bit because it is so darn pricey and I wish they had more designated non smoking areas. I get it trust me I get it (Vegas its a casino etc) but just in my world to be a perfect 5 everything has to be perfect. Otherwise the stay was nice plenty of food options with the App I never once had to step toward the registration desk (you use your phone as your key just make sure you have your bluetooth and wifi fired up. My first time I got myself stuck in the elevator (as you have to key in to get to your floor). Otherwise room was nice (shoot for a higher level floor if given chance - would probably have to visist front desk for that as I was floor 2 staring at the roof. lol Nice stay great location otherwise.
50,Great service and great hotel for the money. Perfect location and overall no issues or complaints. Comfortable beds and clean rooms. We would definitely come back here on all of our trips to Las Vegas.
40,Restaurants where phenomenal especially The Heritage. Food and Service was impeccable. Casino was fun. Easy access to everything on the strip. Right in the heart of Las Vegas. Would stay there again. Thank you for making my stay a memorable one.
50,The Mirage Hotel & Casino is located central to every shop and attraction within walking distance. The staff was very helpful and courteous. Check in and check out was done with ease and the bell staff was quick efficient and very informative. We were so sad to hear the Mirage has been sold and will not be the same in the future.
20,Hopefully Hard Rock overhauls this place because the beds are like rocks and the bathrooms are so small you can’t even open the bathroom door without almost hitting the toilet. Great location and friendly staff but I had back and neck pain the whole trip from those terrible mattresses and I even stayed in a supposedly “upgraded” room.
50,We have stayed at the Mirage twice now and I truly appreciate the vibe at this resort. Everyone is treated equally no pretentious VIP nonsense which is just a false sense of elevated ego. I love the diversity of people here everyones included! Sure you will see a high roller for sure but they are usually the ones in simple attire flying under the radar as to not be noticed! LOL
50,If you're looking to be pampered this is the place to go. The staff is friendly and makes sure you have what you need. The food at all the restaurants is delicious. There's no need to go anywhere else as The Mirage has it all including outstanding entertainment.
40,Great trip to Vegas to experience the NFL Draft…. Iconic Mirage Hotel still great after 30 years. Well maintained & still a great place…responsive staff …. Overall excellent stay. Sad to see it go…..I’m sure the Hard Rock will be nice….but I’ll miss the Grandeur of the hotel that began the Vegas transformation over 30 years ago.
50,We are local but stayed for the NFL draft couldn’t be happier with the price and the location. Loved the vibes from the moment we walked in and the convenience of checking in and out was awesome! Loved having the room key on our phones made very very convenient to use! Can’t wait for our next staycation!!
50,Check in was great. Associate was friendly and liked her job.  Drinks were good and we played at one of the bars and we didn’t have to pay.  Valet is expensive but the staff is appreciative.  Location is good for accessing the strip.
50,Great property great location great staff!! Room was great comfortable bed great restaurants!! All without having to feel like you have walked forever. Hats off to the staff Darla an Melissa were fabulous in the spa and Seth at the pool was phenomenal!! Can’t wait to get back !!
50,MGM always takes care of its customers. Beautiful room awesome staff and great games. For those looking for a great steak house while in Vegas my wife and I always go to Heritage Steak house at the Mirage. Looking forward to returning again this summer.
30,They charge you extra for everything. Parking microwave and a resort fee for everything else. Then give you a fridge with overpriced crap in it. I booked thru a travel service and thought everything was paid for. Then when I arrived I was told I owed another $700+ for resort fees and a deposit! Who charges their guest to park at the hotel they paid to stay in?
50,I've been staying at the Mirage since 1990 when it was nearly brand new. Through all it's ownership changes it has remained a pleasant comfortable and fun place to stay. It's got the right mix of food drink entertainment and gambling options in a very well kept and contemporary facility. I'll hate to see it go!
50,Clean rooms ! Perfect location! Clean bathrooms . Comfy beds ! Friendly staff  beautiful resort with great food ! Lots  Of options! Great lobby bar ! Great sports bar ! Great for families ! Super clean rooms !!! You won’t regret it !
50,There is nothing we do not love about the Mirage. We stay there on every trip. We love the hosts wait staff drivers etc. The Oasis pool is like no other. The rooms are beautiful the location is ideal and we just love every part. We will be sad when Hard Rock takes over.
40,The check in staff and bartenders were all very good. The room looked fairly new with the exception of the shower floor. The bed was super comfortable. Still a nice hotel after all these years. I hope the Hard Rock people take this into consideration now that it has been purchased by them.
10,If you are going to spend this kind of money for a hotel....look elsewhere. Things are dated and malfunctioning. The shower drain does not work. I was in 4 inches of water after a 5 minute shower. The bathroom fan makes a terrible noise and smells like its burning. The MGM digital check in never worked. Even though I had a 3pm check out my keycard access for the elevator and room was disabled at 11am even after i stopped by the front desk to confirm the late check out was in the system. Def not a good experience.
50,Loved the rooms cleanliness. I also was intrigued by beautiful scenery throughout the lobby and the casino. We also liked the vibe of the hotel and casino. Staff was awesome! We always saw staff smiling and working.
50,"At a time when I needed a comfortable getaway greatly my stay at The Mirage was perfect. The property is spectacular and very well-maintained. The variety of things to ""play"" should meet everyone's needs. The extensive pool area provides a delightful play to cool off or sun or sip an exotic drink at the Dolphin Bar. Actually the gi-hugic size of the property also ensures that you WiLL get your steps in!"
50,Just stayed here for 4 nights  very nice property in every aspect great rooms great food very nice pool and casinos and super friendly staff! Also very well located  you can walk to a lot of different places for food  drinks and souvenirs.  We got to see the volcano probably for out last time  always a great experience .
50,First time staying here. I came for my moms birthday and it was a compted room. I only payed for resort fees. I would actually pay for a room here in the future. Very clean hospitality was great. Mr. Kim at the front desk was so friendly. Also our bell desk helper was so great and friendly! Valet employees were also very helpful
50,It was an incredibly delightful experience! The staff at the mirage couldn’t be nicer. From check in to check out we didn’t have any problems at the Mirage. The room was clean staff was friendly and helpful. This was my retirement celebration that had to be put off for two years due to covid but definitely worth the wait! Special thanks to Milly for all her assistance! Cheers Mirage!
20,My little sister went through the mirage to have her wedding. She reserved a room block for the wedding party. When we got there our rooms were ALL on different floors. When it was brought up to management their response was it’s impossible to get everyone on the same and didn’t really care. My sister was really upset only because the reservation was made a year in advance. I’ve been in other weddings in Vegas and had a successful room. Look elsewhere.
40,Fading Gem That’s Perfect for Business.  That’s the headline I’ll put on the review for the good ol Mirage — sold to the Seminoles with plans for a Guitar Hotel like the one in Florida.  The hotel is dated: mini bars and basic bath facilities. But the room I have with an ugly second floor view is quiet clean and has plenty of work space. It’s a quick ride to the convention center and 15-20 min walk to Encore via the tram to TI a hotel that’s certainly fallen fast in 15 years (I once loved it for value and convenience). It’s also a 20 min walk to Bellagio and right close to the High Roller and monorail
50,Fun casino floor that transforms their casino bars into night clubs with live entertainment. There was very little need to leave the resort grounds. The pool offers a great space to cool off under the hot Vegas sun as well. Great atmosphere all around!
30,While the location is great and the amenities are ok the rooms were not as clean as they should be. There is also no complimentary coffee in the room which is even more of an issue because there is only one coffee shop within the resort that almost always has a 20 to 30 minute wait for coffee. Additionally the cleaning staff started to walk into my room without knocking and only after realizing I was still in there did she speak up and I was just getting into the shower.    Automated check-in was difficult and my reservation could not be verified without some info that I did not have with me. The counter staff while fairly friendly were extremely slow.
30,Clean well staffed The cable car is handy to get to Treasure Island and the shopping mall. Ground and outdoor attractions are the highlight. Resort fee makes the place over priced. Look closely at fees and taxes to avoid check out shock!.
40,I love the location. The staff is super friendly and helpful. Oddly it’s the best smelling hotel in Las Vegas. I’ve been staying at the Mirage faithfully since 2010. We are losing an icon. I’ll be interested to see what Hard Rock does but I have my doubts.
20,We have stayed at the Mirage in the past but will not be staying there in the future. Upon arrival we quickly changed into our bathing suits and headed to the pool. Arrived at the pool at 4:50 it closed at 5pm. The next morning it rained lightly for about 1 hour. They closed the pool for the day - the afternoon was hot and sunny this was during spring break! Never got to use the pool that day and they charged us a total resort fee of $78 - rip off. Also they removed the poker room and replaced it with more slot machines.
50,We usually stay at Aria but they were full this time around. Chose Mirage and was very pleasantly surprised. Staff was excellent property is in a good location pool was great and food options were better than average (awesome sushi) if not always open. Sad to hear the Hard Rock folks are coming in to screw things up…they’ve already failed once get a clue the 80’s called and want their business plan back.
30,I was promised an upgrade when I returned from my last Vegas trip (before the pandemic). I was placed in a Mirage suite which was noisy; the elevator motors could be heard running all day and night. We took a break from visiting Vegas because of the pandemic but when we finally came back management had no notes of any promises made about an upgrade since these notes can only go back for “1 year.” As a social content creator I’m going to make a post about my experience on Tiktok. Please visit me @Dr.Kimchee. Mirage Management: if you get this before I upload my post please contact me. Please leave a message on my IG account. A link will direct you from my Tiktok account. Thank you
30,But the volcano only goes off a few times a night instead of every 15-20 minutes. Sad they don't let kids see the tigers and dolphins anymore. Bummed there were no allergy friendly restaurants. Vending machine on 6th floor broken so i couldn't use it despite repeated attempts. Wish there were bottlefillers available.
50,"The Mirage is my ""family"" hotel. Customer service is always great and the casino restaurants etc. everything is handy and great during our visit. The show ""Love"" is one of my favorites and every time I visit Las Vegas I make reservations for the show."
40,No coffee maker in our basic room! Bed was great as was the shower. The service was top notch at Bare pool. $100 chair fee and reservations are required but the fee is a credit towards your tab. Edm music mostly but under rap / hip hop/ rock / latin songs. Would recommend and go back to Bare. No night life / clubs at the mirage. Siegfried and Roy dolphin and tiger tour near pool area. Snacks is open 24 /7 and great!
10,The front desk manager on duty on 04/22/2022 would not honor the military discount even with proper military ID in hand and we are MGM Rewards members. Front Desk staff lied to our faces and said they would not honor the discount even thought the program states to show your military ID at check in.
40,"Great location. Rooms are a little ""worn"". Staff is very friendly. Food is excellent in upscale restaurants. Casual dining is good also. Very busy due to conventions. The Pantry is a great place for breakfast. Used to be open 24/7 but now only open for breakfast and lunch."
10,My room had a backed up sink and we called many times to have it fixed. They came the next day and spent all day inside so we couldn't not enter our room (we had an event to get ready for). They also sprayed all these fumes which made me vomit upon entering.  Also the 2 females in the group were treated poorly at every restaurants and bar by the male employees. The lobby bartender flat out ignored us and wouldn't serve us even though the bar was empty.
50,We had a great time. Although everything is MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE due to inflation we still have a blast. This hotel is centrally located to everything. We love that you can take a tram back and forth between the Mirage and TI.
30,The Mirage is an older hotel that lacks the flash and amenities of many of the other strip hotels. The location is great center strip. The book is actually very large and a great place to watch sports and bet. The pool is nice but nothing extraordinary. Desk and bell staff are good.
40,Rooms are always clean lobby clean and restaurants have wonderful menus and great food. They could use alot more wait staff on the floor of the casino especially in the mornings. but overall I love the Mirage and have been there 6 times
30,We stayed here for business because the event we were attending was at the hotel. The room was nice enough a little larger than many. Bed was comfy. No coffee in the room is downright primitive especially when the journey to Starbucks in casino is long and they don't open very early. The whole place just struck me as more sad and dated than other strip properties.    The hotel was very busy but many dining venues were closed so we ended up leaving the property for half of our meals as we couldn't get tables.
50,It would be funny for the creme de la creme from the '90s to find out that nowadays the Mirage is a value hotel but that's what it these days - and a great one at that. Smallish rooms by today's strip standards but still a great pool and some cheaper dining options. We enjoyed our stay.
40,Had a good time with my family (myself my wife and 3 adult daughters in their mid 20s). Food and drinks good. Valet parking made it easy to get around when needed. Liked the sports bar and the venue that had live music nightly.
50,Mirage turned my girlfriends birthday weekend into the best birthday weekend possible. They upgraded my standard suite to a penthouse suite and gave me a birthday voucher to the casino for $50. Best service I’ve received in the hospitality field.
30,The first part booking in you pay the usual tax and room fees and thee 200 dollars on top which is returned on check out  I tried to book sun loungers but I was told they were all booked up for 3 days but forgot to mention there was free beds to use.  A welcome pack would definitely be a big plus because the hotel is quite large  I played the slots thinking I was earning comps but I was advised it had all changed earlier in the year whereas our last visit after gambling around 2000 dollars on the slots you were giving lots of comps for meals shows etc and believe me you need the comps to eat anywhere in the mirage its so over priced. 1 can of beer 17 dollars food around the pool was totally extortionate.    I was so looking forward to returning to The Mirage after our first time experience but it feels its starting to run the experience down because of the disclosure. I was so very disappointed and feel very cheated of a fantastic experience we had the first time
40,Hadn’t stayed here since 1999. Still awesome mostly due to Steve wynns design and layout. Love how the floors are split into their own elevator banks so you never have to wait or stop when taking elevator. Pool is still really awesome. Staff is very friendly and snacks has the best bacon cheeseburger around. Great hotel for the money. Room could be cleaner.
50,The atmosphere is homey not too big and cold and the staff is friendly from the dealers to the housekeeping. I travel quite a bit ut i always look forward to my time at the mirage and the location on the strip is great.
40,Location just a hair north of the center of the strip can't be beat and rates were reasonable. Property itself is still attractive and retains a bit of its air of luxury but rooms are slightly dated and worn as are lounge chairs at the pool. Nothing that cant be fixed with a refresh which is likely in the near future with the sale to Hard Rock..
10,My room was dirty when I arrived and the daily cleaning service left a lot to be desired. Room AC didn't work. For the price you can find better service elsewhere. The Spa was adequate. Pool is crowded and closes early.
50,We have stayed at a couple of different resorts on the strip prior to the Mirage. We liked the hotel because of our room location and the pool landscaping made you feel like you were in Hawaii. We tried the different restaurants and loved the Heritage Steak House!
40,We stayed in a tower suite on the 27th floor. It was very nice roomy comfortable. We faced the strip which was somewhat noisy especially when the volcano erupted at night. The bed was comfy and we couldn't hear much noise inside the hotel itself. The hotel offers a lot of choices for dining which is nice. We ate at The Still The Pantry and Starbucks. The Still was a great choice for lunch and the Pantry had a wonderful breakfast. We didn't check out the pool area but from the looks and sounds of it it looked like a great time! We would recommend this hotel before Hard Rock takes over in the next year or so.
50,The hotel and casino is gorgeous they are always cleaning food is wonderful staff is friendly the pool..... beautiful!!! I would go back again and again. Right in the middle of great casinos and a stop on the duce
50,Loved our stay at the mirage. Great location on the strip. Good value. Beds are so comfortable and very clean rooms. We had. One the overlooked the volcano so that was a great view when the show was on
50,This casino has everything. Clean rooms good food choices on site  friendly atmosphere. Good shopping for clothes and accessories. If you want something nice without breaking your budget this might be the casino for you. All staff were very pleasant. Our room’s tv remote wasn’t working and they replaced it right away giving us $50 in comp food and drinks in the process. Very satisfied!
50,We had a great time during our stay! We will definitely be back for longer stay. The contactless check in was very convenient! I am pleased with how our trip turned out! We hope to be back soon! Amazing!!!
40,Good enough. Stays there because convention was there. Good staff conscientious helpful.    Would have stayed elsewhere (short-term rental or something) but wanted proximity to convention. Would stay there again if convention is there.
50,Staff is very friendly and hotel rooms are very nice. Definitely worth staying here and best location on strip. Restaurants are very good. Haven’t had a bad dining experience yet. I do recommend the Heritage steakhouse
40,Loved the poll area casino and employees. The rooms were super clean and the food was delicious. We experienced almost everything in the resort and were happy with our time there. Overall a wonderful time spent at the Mirage.
20,The air conditioning did not work. it was hot and muggy all the time. it smelled like old men and cigars. The bedding smelled like wet mildew. The whole room smelled. If it wasnt for my business putting me in this hotel I would not have rented a night here.
10,something was amiss when even the rain forest mist/fog machine wasnt functioning anymore as was usual working on my previous visits. My favorite Cravings buffet closed very disappointing. Transition to Hard Rock going very poorly.
50,Love this place. Always have a great stay. Beds are comfy. Staff are friendly and helpful. Food is delicious. Lots of games to play. We saw the Beatles Love show twice now and would see it again. We will be back.
10,The rooms are very run down dirty and many of the amenities don’t fully work. The rooms were not clean you could hardly see out of the windows and we kept getting sheets with stains on them. I was dismayed by the fact that they’ll still charge $700-$800 for a larger room when there is no additional working amenities.  I also don’t understand why the pool closes at 5 PM. That was a major disappointment.
50,The location of this resort is center strip and very easy to get around.  That staff are very friendly check-in is excellent and the hotel is very clean and well-kept. The location of the restaurants as well placed…
50,I just left The Mirage and I’d visit again. If you want to see “The Mirage” book fart as it’s been bought out. Lots of rumors it’s remodeled or even getting torn down. It’s Vegas… You never know what’s about to happen. The staff was very friendly. The rooms and conference center was nice.
30,Expected more for the amount I was charged. Room was not clean when I checked in. Restaurants are always slow to get a table. Obviously not enough staff like everywhere in the US. Frustrating is what I call it.
20,Getting old and run down not enough options for dining. On property restaurants are mediocre. Shower and toilet in room did not work effectively. Elevator keycards did not work. Long line for check in.
40,Easy check in. Friendly staff. Enjoyed the gaming floor. I try to stay at the different mgm properties and this may be one of the older ones but it’s still one of my favorites. Didn’t dine here too much though.
50,In our many visits to this iconic property it never disappoints us! Excellent value for your money great location excellent service and so many restaurants to pick from. I can't emphasize enough about its  location as it is a short walk to Caesars 2nd best buffet) Treasure Island Wynn ( best buffet) bellagio (best water show) and so many other attractions.    I will miss this property when it is closed down and re-open as a Hardrock Cafe' casino later 2022/2023.  Visit and enjoy The Mirage while you can. You won't be disappointed.
30,Rooms are showing their age there was a red stain on the bed when we arrived. We got in after midnight with 2 kids so didn’t notify staff as we were too tired. Housekeeping did change the bedding the next day. We were also located beside the ice machine which was extremely noisy. We were woken up several times throughout the night and early morning. The positives-the room is spacious (except the bathroom) and the pool is amazing with exceptional service staff. Great location with lots of food and drink options nearby.
10,My wife and I have not stayed here in at least 4 years and this will be our last time. We used to only stay here when visiting Las Vegas and even recommended this resort to anyone who asked us where to stay. Not anymore. The rooms are poorly maintained. The amenities are a joke. The bathroom towels are horrible the bar soap stinks and has zero cleaning ability. Everything is extremely overpriced!
10,750.00 dollars for two nights. That was with the mgm reward card … swimming pool not open after 5 pm. No coffee maker or complimentary breakfast.. over priced snacks and water. We had the refrigerator locked and their water removed from room. Window seals dusty. Reservations were for the Well room.. I did not get
20,Smoke smell everywhere.... and we do not smoke and found it unpleasant. Staff were all very friendly.... maintenance man in hallway was very nice and chatted with us for a bit. Very kind. The Lady that checked us in could not have been better or nicer.... she was tops too. They just need to work on housekeeping.
30,Stayed on 19th floor. Property was fairly nice. 2 beds resort stay. Could see the strip in the distance without all of the noise from the strip. Traveled with my teenage son. Room was spacious but dated. Sheets were clean and beds were decent. The heating/cooling unit worked well. Have to pass through smoky casino to get to guest elevators.
50,As always the Mirage remains our favorite property in Las Vegas. Great rooms amazing pool the best location for strip activities and of course...that smell.... Absolutely devasted that MGM sold the property...stay while you can to enjoy this iconic strip property.
50,I’ve always been a fan of the Mirage. The entire resort is easy to navigate and the staff is the absolute best. They have changed their rewards program a little and it’s a bit confusing. I will still continue to stay there or MGM properties.
30,Even if you’re a hotel guest parking is not free I was told it was $18 for valet so I parked. When I picked up the car it was $30. I hand them cash and then I was told no cash. I understand there is a lack of workers but it showed alot this trip. Very slow service
50,Loved my first stay at Mirage. Great staff all the way around at every venue. The digital check in / out was very simple. Very impressed with new security standards. Food was great at every restaurant. Can’t wait to go back
20,The pool was very cold rooms were not sound-proof at all. Could hear everything the neighbors said and they kept us awake every day. Why don't they heat the pool??? Also everything is very expensive. We miss the day when we felt we could get a good deal on hotel and food.
50,My wife and I stayed at the Mirage March 6 through March 11. The Mirage is a wonderful hotel and casino. The staff is friendly and attentive. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Mirage. We go to Las Vegas every year and have stayed at many casinos the Mirage is by far the best casino that we have stayed at.
30,We had to check in 3 different times because they could not get the room right. They did offer us an upgrade to the 27th floor suite however we had to wake up the grandkids who had already fell asleep to move to another room.    The stay was pleasant and the rooms were very nice and clean. If not for the horrible check in experience I would give 5 stars for the entire stay. But the clerks had one job to do. We even had reservations for two weeks prior to arrival. Also the clerks working the desks at midnight were more worried about disappearing into the back room area to smoke and vape. Each one came back reeking of smoke and vape juice vapors. There was a long line waiting to check in too. Only 2 to 3 desk clerks working.
50,It's a very nice and clean place to stay great location rooms on second floor was small no view i didnt like how they had a mini bar and fridge in the room if you touched or open the fridge you have to pay for it i believe that is a setup.
50,They upgraded our room to a suite and it was wonderful. Everything was clean and nice. Would definitely stay here again. Could use more waiting staff in the casinos. Hard to get a drink sometimes. Would like to see some lower minimums at he tables as well. Other than that it is very nice place to visit.
40,Outstanding. First time at this property and even though it's 35 years old it holds up. The first proper mega resort on the strip Wynn did it right before striking out on his own. Go now before the Seminole take over. Also...go after the Seminole take over!!!
50,The hotel is super busy but really fun! Restarting a are a bit pricier but food was really good! Pool is amazing! Volcano erupting on the hour from 6-11 a great site to see. Conveniently located on the strip everything we did was within a 45minute walk
20,Very disappointed in the hotel. First off we booked two rooms and requested they needed to be adjoining. So I looked at the Mirage App and it only allowed us to check in for one room. I tried calling the number for the Mirage that's listed on the App and it didn't work and was out of service. Why does the App list a phone number that doesn't even work? Then after googling a number for the Mirage the lady on the phone said that she couldn't confirm adjoining rooms and that I can't check in until i was at the hotel in person. This didn't make sense so i had her connect me to the front desk. The front desk person stated first that i needed to pay in advance for adjoining rooms. Nowhere on the Mirage's website did it allow me or offer me the option to pay for adjoining rooms; I would have happily done so. Next the front desk attendant stated that I didn't have to be physically present to check in but that I can't check in for the 2nd room through the App because the App doesn't work when you book two rooms. She also said because i didn't pay previously for adjoining rooms there was nothing she could do except put me on the same floor which ended up being very far apart down separate halls. I asked if there was any way to get a discount on an upgrade to fit into a bigger room and she basically wanted me to pay another $500 dollars. Very disappointed all the way around to say the least.
30,Everything was average- nothing more nothing less. Stayed here for just the last night after 3 nights at Palazzo just to give the kids a different pool vibe the last day. It's absolutely fine if you're on a budget; otherwise no reason to stay here. Lack of body wash aside they couldn't even stock the bathroom with 2 bar soaps so we used the same one for hand washing and shower.
20,Too expensive for what you get    Big room small and old bathroom. Very expensive restaurants and food is just ok. Very well located on the strip that is the 3 stars. They will charge you an extra 39$ for the free wifi (that everybody can use!!) and the fitness center! You can get better deal.
30,I would give it a higher review but it’s hard to the room was very comfortable but the very few or little upgrades done to the room were done very sloppy corners were cut money was saved but the ending product is what people say I want to stay here again and for the price I was not wowed they need to also work on getting a better entrance or putting front desk in a different place because the 8 min walk to the room is just weird
20,My husband and I needed a place to stay in Vegas for a family wedding. The Mirage was one of the closer ones to the wedding venue and didn't break the bank. Stay was okay except for poor housekeeping.    We were given a room with two queen beds which was fine. One of the beds however had a very suspicious stain on the box spring that we presumed was dried vomit given the location on the frame proximity to the head of the bed and context of Vegas. Maybe it was us thinking the worst but bottom line we were not pleased to find a large stain on the bed. As there were no other rooms available that we could move into we were told that housekeeping would be on their way up to clean. When we returned ~6 hours later the stain was still there untouched. No one during our entire 3 day stay came by to clean the stain. We simply did not use that bed. Safe to say we will not be staying at the Mirage next time we find ourselves in Vegas.
30,Average at best. First time I’ve been disappointed in 22 years but it won’t be the Mirage the next time I come to Las Vegas. Wish I had stayed elsewhere so my last memory of the Mirage would have been great.
30,Hotel getting shabby needs refresh. Torn wallpaper worn carpet. Room not the cleanest hair on floor dirty windows. Thin towels only two per room. Staff not as accommodating as on past trips. Disappointing visit as we have been staying at Mirage for years.
50,I took the family to this resort for the first time. Our intention was to enjoy the volcano water falls pools one time before it is converted to the Hard Rock. It didn't disappoint. The food was great the staff was great and the lounge act at night was a perfect way to cap the night. It's been a great run The Mirage. I'll miss you.
20,I stayed at Mirage through the years but wanted to make it a point to stay there before they rebuild Hard Rock in the summer. Stayed for two nights and property itself looked in good shape. The check in was painless but I asked for the free upgrade because of gold status and nothing was told they would have to charge. The room was small but quite clean and better than most resorts these days. The problems started with My vegas slots redemption of free play and sandwhich. I was told by both male and female that the person who handles that did not show up to work. They took my cell number and would call for sure when they remedy it. Went back twice and called 3 times and no one picked up. Went for the third time at night and was told cannot redeem. All 4 times I stood in line anywhere from 10 minutes to 20 minutes. Frustrating that there are 3 ladies standing around for cashier cage but they can only print cards and not help my Vegas slots. Turns out the $10 free play I had and was told it works the first time was never turned on by the first two workers and the forth one finally did it so I could use it. Highlight of the short stay is in the Snacks one of the ladies heard us say we are heading to our flight and said she would wrap our sandwiches to make sure stay fresh. Appreciated her thoughtfulness and first person to help us at our stay. Even when we checked out at 11:30pm in the invited guests line stood there for 30 minutes waiting for the one worker to call to desk. Feels like they really are just saving money and not having enough workers for the size of the property.
40,Like I said the hotel was amazing but the last couple of days they didn’t come in and take out the trash I called and they came in but they just fixed my bed and gave me towls but they left the trash other then that the hotel was amazing ! Staff was great view was great good spot and they had a lot of things to do there ! Restaurant were amazing too
20,I wouldn’t stay here again due to the way the management and front desk treated me. We came for 3 nights and stayed in a suite. The towels in the room weren’t to standard. They were dirty. When asking for a late checkout they were short and rude to me and my colleague. Treating someone nicely goes a long way in this industry.
40,The Cirque de Sole Beatles show was well worth it. Dinner at the Stacks restaurant was pricey but well worth the price. I recommend both. I haven't been to Las Vegas in about ten years - I can't believe so many casinos charge for parking now. That used to be free everywhere. Park at Treasure Island next door. Parking is still free there.
40,This was my first time staying at the Mirage and probably won't be my last. The pool is nice but not as good as MGM's. However Mirage is much closer to most other things on the strip. The bathroom felt a bit dated compared to even normal hotels much less Vegas hotels. We were able to check in early which was great and the concierge was able to help us get some discounted show tickets during our stay.
30,No coffe pot/kettle supplied. A mini fridge is a 35$ a “day” charge plus tax. The toilet was so low to the floor like it was for a 5 year old. Staff was excellent. Casino was very very smokey no ventilation . There was a small no smoking section with a few games
50,The room was nice and clean the staff was friendly and helpful the food options were great and the casino was fun. We will be staying at the mirage again in a few months when we return especially with my MGM awards!
50,We came with our exchange student and he loved the beautiful scenery inside. The staff at the front desk was friendly and efficient and the rooms are very comfortable we stayed in the Stay Well rooms and they were fresh smelling. We loved the Aromatherapy.
50,Everything was great. Had one hiccup and it was quickly fixed by the front desk and housekeeping. Rooms are clean and more than adequate for 2 people. Casino and restaurants were very nice as well. Would love to stay here again in the future.
50,Hotel is superb. Food was good. Room clean. Got large 1 bedroom suite. Kids love it. And the pool. Very nice property. I really like the hotel is not as loud as others. A very laid back hotel with all the bells and whistle you could want.
50,Fun and relaxing. The stay was well worth it. It was close to all the other resorts. Everything was pretty much accessible not far to walk. There was lots of activity going on everywhere shows games you name it was very fun experience.
50,Mirage hotel and casino. Best MGM resort we have been or stayed at. Place needs to remain in the mgm family. Volcano show is always a must see when we visit Las Vegas hard to believe it will be taking out. Change is not always a good thing
50,Traveled here for a business conference rooms were very clean staff friendly and food was good.  Didn't get a chance to gamble or see too many of the sights due to not enough time - but it was still a fun trip!
50,Hotel Staff were so pleasant to deal with - everyone from valet bellhop services front desk bartenders and room service delivery. Everything in the hotel is within reasonable walking distance. It was great to hop on the elevator and head right into the gym.
50,The entire staff at this property made our stay one of the best we'd experienced on the Las Vegas strip one that exceeded our expectations across every level. The hotel value hotel and gaming floor personnel and restaurant crew were all excellent.
50,Arriving you get first class treatment from the minute you walk in the door. Checking in was quick and worry free. Rooms were extremely clean and the resort was very attractive. You felt at home once you settle in.
40,Nice hotel in centralized location. Easily walk to most places on the strip. The rooms are a little dated and worn but staff were great. Very friendly and helpful. Great selections of restaurants and has a Starbucks inside he hotel. Overall good value for your money.
20,Blood on the wall and mold in the shower no maid service for 3 or 4 days including no extra rolls of toilet paper gross! Adjoins rooms smoked pot non stop and it leaked through the adjoining door and made us both sick! Casino wasn’t clean and smelled bad everywhere!
40,Went to see Fluffy. It was a great show. The staff here is way nice and very helpful. The resaurabts are giid and they move prety quick evan for the amount of crowds. The location is good. Everything is walking distance.
50,Our stay at the mirage was relaxing and rejuvenating. Staff was exceptionally friendly. We made reservations for loungers at the adult pool which I would highly recommend. Excellent poolside drinks and food. Breakfast at the poolside café was also tasty.
50,An incredible first time Las Vegas experience. Of all of the MGM properties that I could’ve selected I chose the Mirage as all of the comments that I read held true. It’s an incredible beautiful and clean property. Every touch point from the staff was so perfect. They were all courteous and friendly. The gaming floor was not crowded and all of the popular games were on the floor. During my stay I toured other properties and found that the Mirage was an ideal choice. I will be returning to the Mirage again for my second trip this coming October.
50,Great place to stay will be there again . Staff was great the room was clean and had a lot of room . Just wish you didn’t get rid of volcano (kids love it) also maybe some free upgrades for special occasions anniversaries would be great
20,Wifi was terrible tv rarely worked and forget about their mobile app and digital keys!! Horrible service over priced had never stayed before and will never stay again. Restaurants open late and close early and service was crappy in most places. Only shoutout is to Heather for great service at the pool!
30,Service and staff were friendly but the room cleanliness was very mediocre. There was food behind the night stands when we checked in and the shower felt poorly cleaned and poorly put together. You could see an obvious gap between the toilet tank and bowl.
50,Nice clean and pleasant hotel. Rooms were nice. Bar with live music was a plus and the drinks were good. Can’t wait to come back out and enjoy a couple days of good old fun. Will definitely stay here again.
20,Took multiple rounds and 2+ hours to get access to room. Staff were not surprised nor helpful that 3rd set of keys didn’t work. Had to leave someone in room to get back in. Wallet stolen on casino floor. Security staff gave family wrong directions within hotel - multiple times. Great pool.
50,We stayed 5 days…and from checkin to checkout everything was outstanding. Several staff members went above and beyond to help us make our stay a very good one! We will most definitely be staying at The Mirage again!!!!
50,Great trip! Great location! Slept really well! Only problem is the water and snacks sitting on top of the refrigerator which have a charge I knocked one over and had a $15 room charge for that one knocked over. It was reversed the next day when I bought it to guest services attention and they told me how that happens.
50,Absolutely love this place! Great location mid-strip. Plenty of food and gambling options. Great sportsbook as well. The Still was my favorite place to watch the games. I was here for March Madness and will definitely be staying here again.
50,This hotel is in a great location on the strip. There are many reasonable restaurants nearby and for early risers the Starbucks and Snacks were open at 5:30AM. Free drinks when gambling which not all casinos are offering anymore. The rooms were very comfortable and clean. I wish rooms would take out the mini bars and put in mini fridges.    5:
50,Everything was close to the room elevators from retail to dining and casino. Casino seemed less smoke-filled than others. Staff was always helpful. Rooms cleaned daily unlike some these days. Stay in a tower room you won’t regret it. Huge with great views.
50,Hotel is absolutely stunning. Staff are amazing. Rooms are clean and beds are so comfy. Lots of restaurants in the hotel that are decently priced. The pool is AMAZING so much room and lots of chairs for everyone to sit on can also bring your own booze in which is a bonus. Highly recommend
50,My sister and I just enjoyed 5 nights at The Mirage Hotel & Casino. The room was clean and comfortable and we enjoyed playing the slot machines there. We won and lost but had a great time trying the different slot machines. Love The Pantry for breakfast.
40,My stay was good. I was expecting a complimentary coffee in the room but did not have it. Disappointed. Bathroom smelled musty I assume the towel or rags or cleaning solution that is being used to wipe down the bathroom makes it smell like that.
50,We always choose to stay at the Mirage it is our favorite location and casino to attend as well as great food and shops. Perfect spot on the strip around everything we like to do. Cannot speak for future stays as they were just bought out by the Hard Rock but the Mirage through MGM has always been amazing
40,Stayed at the Mirage this week on my first trip to Vegas celebrating my birthday. I loved the venue especially the spa! The location on the strip is so convenient and the staff is so helpful. Would definitely stay here again!
10,Between the lack of cleanliness the rude employees and the smell in the room we won’t be going back. The great price does not make any of this ok. Additionally rude bartenders who yell at you for not knowing they were closed at 4pm just doesn’t sit well with me.
50,The one of my favorite vocation cool food and drinks very clean rooms and pools. nice shows. all together in one place. definitely i will recommend to my friends and family well done the mirage …..
20,This place is old and dated the carpets & chairs & rooms are disgusting and dirty (even when cleaned). The casino is old and dated just old machines and nothing new or exciting. Never coming back. Of course we just stayed to see what it was like here before it's gone anyways so not that this feedback would even matter. We transfered out after 1 day to another Mlife location so Mlife still gets our money and business so of course nobody would care about this feedback to The Mirage in any case. Just a shame that it's so crappy.
50,If you think Vegas isn't a good place for a family trip....think again! We had a fantastic spring break. The Mirage is the perfect hotel for families. We got the hospitality suite which was 2BR 2-1/2BA. It was fabulous! With 2 teenagers the extra bedroom and living area was key to us not feeling like we were stuck all in one room for a week. Definitely worth the extra money.
50,Staffs and hotel room are very good. The Slots machines are new and always cleared .I sure we were come back soon. We Love las Vegas and for sure I will be recommended to all of my friend. We watched volcano Show and it was amazing.
40,The mobile check in was great since we arrived so late. The beds were comfy and room was adequate but could use an update. There are lots of fun things to do and see there. My only complaint was that there were hairs from prior guests on the shower walls. This should always be cleaned before new guests come.
40,Word on the street is that they’re turning the Mirage into a Hard Rock which is kind of a bummer. Was super busy but never had to wait in any crazy lines anywhere like elevators and restaurants. Pretty clean rooms are average. The pool is dope af.
50,The Mirage was Wonderful. Location Location Location. Beautiful Resort. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Spa tub was absolutely relaxing. The view was Amazing. We loved watching the Volcano show.
10,The rooms were awful! They smelled musty like a locker room. There was trash left from the previous habitants. The entire property was poorly maintained regarding cleaning. My husband and I got yelled at by a bartender (after we had been sitting at the bar for 10 min) that it was closed.
40,I've never lodged at Mirage but it was an excellent experience and I would definitely return again. The poolside service was superb and all the staff was friendly and accommodating. I highly recommend you give it a stay.
10,Nothing worked right anywhere. Mobile key didnt work (has worked at every other hotel) and charging outlets were ridiculously inaccessible. The two you can use near the bed charged 12% over night - plugged phone into regular charging port with same cord charged 71% in 40 minutes. All around terrible experience
10,Bed bugs and dirty towels I have a rash and bites all over me. Bathtub and sink disgusting I learned my lesson never stay anywhere in vegas except Caesars. At least they helped me to get in there hotel
50,Everything was great. Hotel and room was clean and well maintained. Checking in and out was simple and convenient. Great location on the strip. Only negative thing was the curtains were not truly black out.
50,I Enjoy staying with Mirage Hotel & casino because I feel really comfortable and I Enjoy playing all kind of Games plus the casino service they are really very good . and I Enjoy eating food at the casino .
30,I had stayed at The Mirage many times over the years and decided to stay one last time on my most recent trip to Vegas. While the hotel itself has held up pretty well the gambling floor has been dramatically reduced to accommodate more bars and restaurants. Great if you are there to eat not so great if you like to gamble.    They offered early check in (for a fee) and we went with the digital keys. Great in theory but not in practice. Like most hotels cell service is iffy in elevators where you need to have the key to get to you floor. There was more than one time we were trapped on the elevator trying to get the key to work.    The charge for early check in was just the beginning for the charges. There is now a charge for quests to use valet parking a very high fee for ATMS and it was $18 for a bottle of water from the mini bar (by the way there was really not another option to get a bottle of water unless you wanted to leave the hotel).    Lastly the in room check out defaulted to being charged for late check out. The nickel and dime fees for one night ended up being more than the room. To top it all off it was windy. We had paid to upgrade to a volcano view room and there was no volcano show.    I was hoping for one last awesome Mirage stay. It was not to be.
50,After so much walking both at the show I was visiting and then in the evenings along the strip a good night sleep is vital. Beds and pilows at the Mirage are great and rooms are very quiet. Everything is perfect for really resting.
50,Great place and customer service clean and fun place great pool nice room great slot machines and food service was great and amazing would recommend this place to everyone loved it 100 percent see you soon
50,The Mirage may have been sold but enjoy it while it is there! Casino play is great and the staff is excellent. Go before it turns into the new casino! It is a great experience! Enjoy the pool and the sight of the volcano before it is gone!
50,We got married in vegas and stayed here for the week. Wonderful hotel and fantastic service. It has a really chilled vibe and the decor is gorgeous. Rooms cleaned every day. Thanks for making our trip great Mirage!
50,Was a wonderful stay! Lovely room great pool area. Beautiful grounds. Located in the middle of the strip but more laid back. I appreciate the choices of food and shops onsite. While the gaming area is not huge- it has a variety of machines.
40,With the upcoming change in ownership it is unlikely that many renovations or upgrades will happen. Lack of affordable dining is a wave of the future at many properties. I have enjoyed staying at the Mirage over the last 30 years. Looking for what’s going to happen next
40,We had a nice stay….Mirage is centrally located so easy to walk to other places along the strip. Check-in and check-out was quick and friendly . We had a nice room with mountain/pool views . Cleaning staff did a great job. Rooms could be improved with removal of tired rugs and by adding a coffee maker . Sports book is good ..lots of screens ..we were there during first week of March Madness..fun! We thought the Mirage had everything we needed and appreciated that we didn’t have to walk miles and miles to go to the casino shops and restaurants …hotel is a perfect size and a good value.
50,Very clean and very friendly staff!! Very good restaurants throughout the hotel. The pool was huge and staff came around to take food and drink orders. Beach Towels were also provided. There are also several stores in the hotel. The casino is huge!!
40,The stay at your establishment was great. My wife is home schooling the grandson and we made it her holiday. It was what she needed. We had great dinners. The spa was great the staff was awesome.
50,The Mirage is always a hands down choice for a great time in Vegas! I find it to be ideal on the strip with multiple accommodations throughout the casino itself. An now that it's pool season I was able to enjoy some soak an sun as well.
50,Great service ....I couldn't have ask for anything more. Great job to all!!! The housekeeping was wonderful...the staff knew hoe to help or serve. Please keep the Great job going. I can't say enough....u all need a pat on the back and maybe a raise :)
40,Great. Service excellent. Room ready for early arrival. Room very clean. Enjoyed it all. Food was great. Casino was kept clean. The Beatles show was a treat. We are looking forward to our next trip to the Mirage.
50,Magnificent Mirage!  Good vibe!  Rooms were clean and tidy.  Pools area s were clean and available .  Lobby area kinda typical.  As elite traveler not many M club perks..  However the operations manager (Patrick?)  Stepped in and helped to get yhe stay magnificent!  Hyatt elite was improved!  Yhanks mirage team !  And manager of operations!
50,Wife and I enjoyed our getaway and our Stay at the mirage was remarkable. Definitely meet our expectations and staff was friendly. Plenty to do pool gamble eat and not to mention great drinks at center bar.
50,Everything was perfect. We could not ask for anything more. The service was excellent. Would absolutely love to do it again. Staff was courteous restaurants excellent and rooms were clean and spacious.
50,Mirage is my home away from home. I was able to unpack and get to my room with no problem. I didn’t even need a key. Clean room and spotless restroom. My friends were surprised on how big the room was
50,Amazing hotel. Going to miss it when it’s gone. We had an amazing view of the volcano and for my first time in Vegas that was one of the best attractions. Also a great view of the strip at night. Nice clean room and super quiet
50,Love love love The Mirage !! Best location on the strip !! Very clean ! If I had to pick out of the thousand hotel in Vegas The mirage is always number one !! Love the parties you really don’t have to leave the hotel for anything!!
50,This was a business trip staff was excellent service was excellent Speedy check in the room was immaculately clean all my needs were taken care of I enjoyed my stay very much the bed was very comfortable and not all hotel rooms are like that
40,This was the 2nd time I had stayed here. The location is excellent as it is close to many other casinos. The food choices are very good and reasonably priced by Las Vegas standards. The Sportsbook is very spacious with nice tv’s. I spent a lot of time there and highly recommend it for viewing games. The only below average things I could note are the rooms are a bit outdated and the slot machine variety is not great. Overall I enjoyed myself and will stay there in the future
50,Fun! Had a good time with my lady and son..went to the zoo and dolphin thing down on the main lobby area. Was amazing . Definitely will come and do this trip again. Did some gambling and won. Amazing time!
50,My wife and I enjoyed staying at the Mirage for 4 nights on a quick get-a-way vacation. Everything the Hotel & Casino offered was very satisfactory. Like most gambling enthusiasts we were disappointed in the tightness of the slot machines. The only machines paying out were the ATM machines.
50,The hotel was clean and the Dj at night was great. All of the staff was friendly and you must eat at the Mexican restaurant so delicious. The casino was clean and didn’t smell like smoke even though there was people smoking.
50,I attended the realty 2.0 conference for 3 days and all the facilities and services were superb… conference rooms were large clean and very wel decorated tv’s monitors cameras and great internet service…. Overall all the attended were extremely satisfied with their experience at the mirage
50,The Volcano was a must before it is gone! The room was clean hotel smelled good. Staff was friendly. Plenty of places to shop/eat. My Husband and I enjoyed our stay. Uber/Lyft/Taxi service was easy to get to as well.
50,The stay was wonderful!!!! I love the sceneary. The room was very nice and the view of the strip and volcanic show was beautiful. The staff is super friendly and eager to help. The food was so good my fav and must go to is Diablos Catina and you have to get the Gelato as well !!!
50,This was a quick family trip my main event BTS Concert. The Mirage was clean and very accessible to other attractions. We enjoy our time. The room was comfortable and clean. The floor was quiet and pool was perfect.
40,"This was our first time staying at the Mirage; however it won't be the last. The atmosphere felt open clean and a bit tropical. The rooms are comfortable clean and well appointed. The staff were friendly and there were many food options. The casino is easy to navigate and there was a pleasant vibe that I can't explain. It felt ""airy and light"" walking through the casino. We really enjoyed our stay."
30,For the price the ammenities did not add up. The bed was horribly uncomfortable. There was also no fridge because it was filled with mini bar items. The shower never got to a comfortable temp and only stayed warm for a few minutes when it finally did warm up a bit.
50,Good restaurants and room service. Excellent value for such pleasant surrounding.saw the Beatles show at a very good price due to our stay at the Mirage.Also found the gambling machines fairly fair. Did a lot of gambling on horses which is my weekness. Been going to Mirage for 35years.
50,The Mirage property was very clean restaurants on site were very good great bar choices and would definitely come back next time! Also front desk personnel were very friendly and helpful as were the agents in the sports book!! Topping it off was the amazing pool…always sunny no matter where you sat!
40,We stayed 3 nights    Pros: clean rooms room service easy to find your way around friendly staff great pool area. One of the nicer ones I’ve stayed at on the strip for the price. Had a view of the strip too. Great location on the strip!    Cons:  As with all hotels in the strip - no coffee maker or fridge in the room and a ridiculous “resort fee” for what? I don’t get that. They nickel and dime you in Vegas! That’s for sure!    Other:  Use the MGM app and check in on the App then use the mobile key. It’s a little strange to use your phone as a key but it works. Then you don’t have to wait in a line to check in! You can always get a key card later. The hardest thing was taking the elevator. You have to tap the phone key to the reader in the elevator then push the floor you want. Was slightly tricky    Also if you check out and need to leave your bags - you can leave with bell hop station just outside the front door    Ask tip:  Rent a car for a day from Avis right from the hotel! We rented it for 24 hours and picked up at 2:30 pm to 2:30 pm next day and went to Valley of Fire. Awesome day trip and they use the same parking lot of hotel - Mirage self-park and give you a free parking pass! We booked through Avis online before our trip
40,Splitting up our drive home to San Diego from Utah visiting family. It was the half way point and was a Quick Trip for us. We enjoyed our stay and especially our awesome steak dinner at the Heritage Steak House.
20,The room wasn't as clean as it has been on previous trips. Our A/C in one bedroom didn't work and it took several hours to get it repaired. Maybe they aren't maintaining the hotel because of the sale. There was a dog barking all hours of the night for 3 nights. We called both the front desk and security several times each night but the dog kept barking. We tried to switch rooms but there wasn't one available. Also there are long lines everywhere their excuse is employee shortage. A couple of the restaurants where you could eat breakfast and lunch have closed. Very few places to eat breakfast and lunch. Room service menu is limited and is delivered in a to go paper bag with plastic utensils and fast food style condiments my husbands omelet arrived cold. I don't know where you would eat room service if your room doesn't have a table.
50,We booked a 2 room suite for our anniversary. The room was clean and big with a nice view. We visited the restaurants and all had great food. The casino floor is on the smaller side compared to other places but all together we had a great trip here.
40,good resort/clean/like others everything is expensive/should not charge for parking for those who stay there. Need more staff for check in. The in room mini bar/ref is ridiculously expensive like others.
40,"The location could not be any better. Friendly staff. AS The Mirage transitions to become a Hard Rock Hotel the theme of the hotel will change as will upgrades to some of the ""worn"" and dated aspects of the rooms."
50,Most of the trips have been for my daughter's dance competitions. And the rooms are always very clean the public bathrooms too and the cleaning person is very friendly and always on the lookout to check them. years my room as always clean and they have helped me in special needs for my girl thanks for her attention and of course I will return soon ..
50,We loved this place. Everything from the online check-in with the MGM app to the beautiful room to the day bed reservation at the pool was excellent and flawless. We stayed in a two queen bed Stay-Well room and loved it. The bathroom is a bit on the smaller side but still very nice. The pool is awesome but reserve a day bed or chairs or you'll need to get there early to get a seat. The location is one of the best on the strip as well. We will definitely return!!
50,We traveled for dance competition in the hotel. Room was nice had a little trouble with water draining but tech came up and fixed right away. Had to call a second time and came up again. Overall was nice stay but restaurants were a little pricey.
50,Overall this was one of the best places we have stayed in Vegas having tried a handful of hotels over the years. Excellent restaurants good pool lively casino floor and a smooth checkin made this a great place to stay for my wife and I.
20,They gave my hotel room away that I booked 8 months prior to checking in. After 2 room changes and many conversations we finally miraculously got our room back.    Caroline one of the front desk associates told us that the only way we could get a rollaway bed was to pay $40 in cash. It ended up being a scam.    4 hours later after they told us they would “rush the cleaning” our room smelled like sewage. The first time they sent housekeeping up who just sprayed disinfectant on the floor.    They gave us a $250 credit on a bill that was over $4500. Everyone other than Caroline was wonderful but the process was a disaster.    I’ve stayed in the Hospitality Suite in the Mirage before and was extremely excited but ended up being extremely disappointed and frustrated.
50,We were treated like Royalty by the entire staff from the moment we pulled up. Our overall experience was tremendous We had a group of 120 from all over the country fly in for a fun weekend. Our accommodations were spectacular the property is beautiful and the staff from Bell Hop front desk check-in management and Casino staff and dining crew all go above and beyond to treat you special. I can't wait to make a return trip and are so excited to see what the future holds for the property moving forward!
30,Location was great and the rooms are very spacious. The bathroom left a lot to be desired. It was small and the bathtub had rust on the drain. Also it looked like the ceiling was developing black mode but I wasn’t sure.
40,Arriving to the Mirage and seeing the fish tank was amazing. Checking in was fast and the staff was very friendly. I was bummed that the restaurants where not open every day and that lead to only trying 3 restaurants during my stay. The pool closed too early and my room was a bit dirty. Overall it was not bad.
10,The bathroom was dirty hairs on the toilet no gel soap only one measly sliver of cheap soap the internet didn't work and the in-room dining menu was terrible only bar food fried food and no clean vegetables or healthy choices. Terrible experience. Tom Kristy CEO SuperVision
50,Came with family and friends. Check in with super easy via mobile check-in. Staff was very friendly. Service at restaurants was very good. Easy to find 10 or more seats at the pool together. Parking was very easy. as well as walking to everything in the area.
50,great friendly staff super nice pool and comfy rooms i love that they have all kinds of fun things to do in Vegas even if you're not into gambling. movies dolphins and live shows like cirque de solei.
10,I have stayed at the mirage twice in the past year and both times something has been broken. Ice machine always breaks down and during this trip in 2022 the elevator to our floor was broken. And of course you cannot use the stairs which is ridiculous. I wish security would just allow the guests to use the employee elevators in the short term to help with the 200+ person line. The service needs to approve before I ever consider staying here again.
50,Loved The Mirage! Decor is a little out-dated but that’s so minor I could care less. Our room was very clean and well taken care of. Some people complain it’s too small but I found it spacious and comfortable. It’s a hotel room you’re not supposed to stay there but for sleeping and showering anyway. You cannot use the mini-fridge for personal use which is kind of a bummer but not so much that it ruined my vacation. Customer service in every location exceeded my expectations. The pools are lovely!! The location in the middle of the strip is amazing for bouncing around to the other resorts. Highly recommend checking out Cirque: LOVE which is on the 1st floor of The Mirage (my whole group absolutely adored it!!) Would absolutely stay here again if they weren’t turning it into a Hard Rock.
50,Nice accommodations room was comfortable plenty of drawer space for a week long stay good access to strip and to other restaurants pretty grounds. Numerous Options for what type of room we wanted.
50,I was here on a business trip. I am from NC and I have never been this far from home. Check in was a breeze with the MGM app. Everything was very clean. I really enjoyed The Secret Garden and the dolphins were so cute. The location is close to everything. You really don't have to leave the hotel because it has everything you need right there.
50,We had a wonderful time on our first trip to Vegas. The Mirage was clean staff was friendly and it was just a memorable time! Also got engaged here!!! :-) Sad they will be tearing down the Mirage but will be excited to see what come of the new hotel. I just love the location!
20,It doesn’t matter how early you make your reservation or if you reserve multiple room or tell them on the app what time you will be there. If you don’t specifically ask if the person before you has a late check out you won’t be told. Got 1 room on time had to wait 5 hours for the other (after I asked)
50,Everyone is so nice! Room was comfortable! Secret Garden and Dolphin Experience is a must! Reasonably priced exhibits including Cirque Du Solei The Beatles Love! This show was Epic! The volcano was also amazing. Cab service from the hotel was a breeze. Cabs come every few minutes. Miss the hotel and staff already!
20,My main gripe is with lack of helpful employees and bad guest rooms. In the rooms the bed was by far the hardest worn out bed I ever slept on. No comforter just sheets. Shredded curtains wall paper peeling and cracks in walls.
50,The Mirage is an excellent Hotel with a great location and quality restaurant options to choose from. Exceptional property!!! The pool area is beautiful and the poolside service was fantastic. When you exit the Hotel your right in the heart of the strip!!!!
40,Awfully uncomfortable mattress great pool area casino floor great options food average. Long walk to room would upgrade to suite to get closer to elevators. Valet easy to use your car is waiting within 4 minutes every time.
50,We very much enjoyed our stay. Staff was very friendly. Food was over-priced so we mostly ate off-site. We rented a car so I enjoyed having parking included at other MGM hotels during our stay. Coffee pot in the room would be nice.
50,Great location across the street from the show I was there to see and McDonalds for fast and cheap coffee since there are no coffee makers in the rooms. Didn't love that but everything else was great.
30,There is no denying that the location of the Mirage is perfect and I imagine it was really something to behold a few decades ago. Now however everything is just little too dingy for a 4+ star property.
40,My wife and I had a wonderful time and felt like we were accommodated as much as could be possible. at the slightest sign of an issues someone took care of it. BUT the only thing was possibly being charged if any of the snacks were lifted ( we have 5 kids so its likely by mistake it could) I was too worried to use the fridge to put in any extra food that I didn't finish BC i didn't want to be charged for it there are other ways to offer conveniences and extra amenities than having extra fees that dont equate the price for them.
40,it was the first time that I stayed at the Mirage what is located on the strip for a convention. The front desk people where professional and friendly even if I had a question after checking in completely by the phone app.    The Elevators to the rooms are center located in the building and that made it very pleasant to walk anywhere quickly so I was not to late.    The only minor is that there was no coffeemaker at the hotel room but that is my personal thought.
50,clean rooms easy check in and easy check out great location lots of choices for restaurants friendly staff  convenient transportation via Uber duece bus . We will be back enjoyable trip we really enjoyed!
50,My family and I enjoy staying at the mirage every time we come to Vegas. We have tried other hotels by far we are most comfortable here. The pool area is also very comfortable. Stay well has very comfortable rooms with very nice mattresses.
50,Great location in a beautiful hotel. Everything you need from comfortable beds to wonderful food options (from snacks breakfast and sandwiches to fine dining) cleanliness great pool area with waterfalls and friendly and knowledgeable staff. Would definitely stay here again!
40,The only issues I had were that there wasn't any access to a fridge and/or microwave in our room. The casino stores restaurants ice cream shops scenery sounds around us and the ambiance that was everywhere was just perfect!!!
50,The Mirage has an absolutely beautiful property! The palm trees waterfalls and pools make it feel like a tropical vacation! We were on a family trip and it was great for kids! The pool has waterfalls and the dolphin experience and secret garden were SO neat! The kids LOVED it! They still talk about it! The Staff is very friendly! They helped us with a room change at check in no problem and the room was cleaned daily! Custodial staff is exceptional which i feel like is a big part of being on vacation! Coming back to a clean rooms is always so nice!! I do miss the microwaves and refrigerators though!! Please bring them back!
50,Location food pool and accommodations are perfect. The rooms are a little tired but the cleanliness makes it perfect…best of all the place has a great vibe. You can’t go wrong staying here as you are in the centre of what Vegas has to offer.
50,I was here for a business convention. The location is great. Staff is very friendly. Beds are comfy. The bathroom is small you can’t use the refrigerator and there isn’t a microwave. Otherwise I really enjoyed my stay.
50,Stayed at The Mirage for a conference. Totally satisfied with my stay. Spacious room excellent choice of restaurants conference center close by. I want to especially compliment the housekeeping staff who provided outstanding service each day.
50,Loved the location of the hotel. It was very convenient. The staff was great rooms were clean and courteous. After walking the strip and checking out all the other hotels this was definitely one of the good ones Will definitely stay here again.
20,This property was loud annoying and would not stay again. Beatles LOVE show and was the only great thing. That show saved us from having the worst experience. Imagine waking up to door slamming parties crowded pool with nowhere to sit. Sucked.
30,Well here is the core issue. I found the pillows in the room to be grossly overstuffed. My head was bent up at over 45 degrees when I layed on my back. All four pillows were exactly the same amount of being filled and softness. I simply couldn't sleep. A call to housekeeping got me the answer that they were all the same and they couldn't offer me any alternate. I then proceeded to fill a pillowcase from one of the fat boys with extra towels to get a smaller pillow.    The moral of the story is that the Mirage is a huge enterprize that serves one size for all and like it or lump it. One should not expect to receive personal service at a huge institution. If my conference doesn't return there next year I won't either.
50,So sad to hear that the MIRAGE will be closing --- We cannot imagine the strip without the MIRAGE...the volcano... and the dolphins.. This is very upsetting. Such a beautiful facility... Vegas will not be the same.
50,Everything was great. Used mobile check in mobile room key and mobile check out and never went to the lobby once. Dealers were fun and friendly. Ate at Calif Pizza Kitchen Heritage Steak and Snacks Deli and all were very good. Of course the pool is also enjoyable. Definitely like the location for the convenience of where I like to go.  Hope to return before the switch to Hard Rock begins.
50,Location was ideal. Food choices were good. Gambling area offered variety of choices and they kept it clean. Staff was great. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Easy to get cab. Offered variety of shows and things to do at the hotel.
40,Hotel staff was great very friendly and professional. Rooms are good value clean and spacious. Enjoyed the pool and goos atmosphere on the casino floor. Only downside was very small bathrooms in the standard rooms.
50,The pool is my favorite and have visited most every one in Vegas. Staff actually stops in often seeing if you need refreshment even in the non-VIP sections. Great service. I so wish Mirage was not changing to a HARDROCK venue!
50,It’s a shame they are tearing it down at the end of the summer or we would definitely come back. The service was great and the room was comfortable and inviting. The food was delicious and prompt service. There were enough slot machines for everyone.
30,We got 4 nights free also a resort credit and free play when you check in make sure you ask as they didn’t offer it but I knew we have the perks. Also later check out would be nice. Noon is not that late. Most places accommodate you if you ask. King room was nice comfy bed and hot water great. Didn’t like that you couldn’t use the fridge to store your own cold drinks. Coffeemaker would have been nice too.
40,It was very easy to book. I loved the online check-in and digital key. Having a digital key did Cuz some problems on the elevator where the app didn’t want to quickly load. But all in all it wasn’t too bad. The room was clean and nice.  I didn’t feel like I was suffocating on smoke in the casino or the hotel tower. The pool area was clean staff was all very nice. We had a good dinner at Osteria Costa.
10,We were very disappointed with our stay. Right from the start we didn't get the room we booked a King with $50 a day food & beverage allowance. We were put in a 2 queen. The room was in great need of repair including the veneer separating from the head board and just hanging there.    We were never given instruction on how to use the food & beverage allowance and it never credited to our account even though I went down and asked the front desk about it. I was assured NO PROBLEM. When we checked out I asked and the front desk girl said she would have to manually enter it. Beyond frustrating.    The Oasis pool was never full yet when we tried to make reservations it said unavailable. Wednesday morning we went to the pool desk and overheard the staff asking if they could release lounges. I get you want to show favor to your high rollers but I was a paying customer and made to feel unimportant.    Finally I can’t believe you can get away with NOT pricing all the stuff you put in the room and the fact that we could not even use the refrigerator in our room was ridiculous. I will NEVER stay at your property.
50,Casino tables were set up in a perfect layout. Foods great. Show was great. And close to everything. Everyone had a blast beds were comfy. Make sure you try out the Mexican restaurant on the south end. And the sports bookie was top notch …………………………………………
20,It will take less time and money to demolish and rebuild than actually deep clean the hotel. Basically Circus Circus Part 2. Filthy bathrooms and sheets. Room was like a quarter mile from the elevator!
20,I was disappointed by the surprise deposit of $300. The vending machine in my floor never worked the whole time we were there. Yes there’s a 24hr CVS & Walgreens but maybe I wasn’t in the mood to leave the hotel. The mini bar charged $10 for a can soda
50,Centrally located on the strip it is the perfect location if you like to walk. The staff was very pleasant and helpful! Snacks is a bit pricey but food quality is very good. Wish the Mirage wasn't going away would stay there again.
50,Very good customer service. I met staff from food serve  room service  bar and lounge  gaming and the concierge dept. All interactions were professional and answered all my needs . The hotel and property very well maintained and clean . This being very important coming out of the pandemic. Prices were high but expected with world /country situation . Appreciated the security and security systems the Mirage has in place . Room  elevators and personnel security made my stay relaxed and safe.
50,Mirage great service amenities and staff. Their location is amazing. Easy to get to everything you need! Close to so many casinos great restaurants pharmacy entertainment. Highly recommend the mirage
50,The pool was amazing had an Excellent time. You are close to all the other hotels didn’t have to move my car at all. I can’t wait for my next stay. All the staff is super friendly!!!! Also some great news as well.
40,Beautiful hotel and casino! I loved the daily room turn-down and replenished linens and towels black-out curtains and view from the 12th floor of our stay-well suite. The rooms were very clean and relaxing. You’ll enjoy the vitamin-infused shower and heap-filtered air; however the bed was like sleeping on the floor. Thank God for the super-soft pillows. And the in-room mini bar is not a benefit. It’s actually a very over-priced but well-stocked mini-fridge with great adult mini beverages snacks and cokes. Treat yourself to a mini can of Pringle’s chips for $10.00 each (a mistake not made twice).
40,Spur of the moment Vegas just for us weekend. I booked this resort for location and price (with my mgm rewards). Overall we had a nice time the resort is located by several other casinos within a reasonable walking distance.
50,The Mirage is a beautiful clean hotel that has much to offer! The location on the Strip is perfectly situated. The casino is large yet very clean. In fact that is something I can say about the hotel in general: it is a very clean property.  The hotel rooms are clean but pretty basic. The hotel room bathroom is small compared to other properties we’ve stayed at. But the ability to get from the room to anywhere on property is excellent!  The pool is massive and beautiful. It’s also clean with easy access to the whole pool. Servers were working their butts off and kept you hydrated with your favorite drink.  The restaurants are good and serve a variety of options for all tastes.  Overall it’s a welcoming atmosphere with clean accommodations!
50,My room was very reasonably priced. The bed was regularly made!!!  The shower was immaculate. I was able to find some reasonably priced  restaurants in the hotel which as someone on a budget was a real help!!    My only problem was that the wall safe in my room did not work!!    Otherwise I was very happy and would look forward to another stay!!
50,Location is great. Beds are always super comfortable and clean.I definitely will be going back. We went during march madness but it was still great and service was amazing. The weather was beautiful can not wait to go back
50,Best Vacation in a long time! Enjoyed the Hotel very clean and welcoming. The staff was very friendly helpful and cheerful. Beautiful Hotel the Beatles show was amazing.Will recommend the Mirage to all my family and friends.
50,Good place to stay good selection of games to play  good selection of restaurants to choose from  My only complaint would have liked to have a fridge in room instead of a way over priced mini bar that most people never use.
10,The room was dirty 2 female staff members from pool area secured 5 lawn chairs ro their relatives/friends when many people were in need of chairs very disrespectful & unethical not to mention ghetto!
30,I just don't see the point of paying the increased costs relative to other adjacent hotels of similar quality.    Staff was nice room was fine location was slightly better than other options. It just didn't stand out as that much better than other hotel experiences I've had it in Vegas. The hotel will be the most forgettable part of this trip.
50,Nice room but a couple of cons:would like to see a hotel with no smoking allowed and the lack of coffee in room.would also like a fridge in room with no product in it.prices could be more affordable on weekdays.
30,I know its a vegas thing i guess but not having coffee in your room is a tragedy to me every moring waking up on the 12th floor. Not being able to use the fridge without charges every time you open is absolutely strange to me. We paid over $300/night and had no microwave either. Those 3 things come standard in most hotels across the country so why does vegas have to be so lame. The sushi place otoro in the hotel was just ok. I have had much better and more authentic sushi where i live in visalia california thats central valley california with tbetter than this? Yes absolutely! Shout out to Sushi kuu! No one can beat you! Also i asked the guy at the front desk upon check in how much the snacks in the room were and he wouldnt even tell me the price….i aksed so like what $20 and he again just responded its a lot…um ok    The service everywhere on the property was great and very friendly and helpful! Our favorite was Tony at the bar! You the shi* Tony!
50,We had a great time at the mirage and felt very comfortable. The whole family had alot of thing to do there .    We have been comming here for a while whether is ourselves or the whole family.The crap tables to the slot machines are always been great.
50,Kind Staff great conference meals clean facilities one stop shopping. Staff at restaurants shops poolside Dolphin area F&B/conference meals and cocktails and casino floor team were all very cordial and helpful. The 3 different staff at bellstand that assisted me were super efficient and very proper.
20,I normally stay at the Mirage for business and the last couple times I have been very disappointed with the rooms. They are run down and haven't been clean. This time the floors had stuff all over like it hadn't been vacuumed for weeks the desk had some gross substance on it (enough that I went to the store and grabbed some disinfectant wipes to clean it) the bathtub had rust spots in multiple places on the floor and the exhaust fan didn't work.    Last time I stayed I also did a review and complained and never got a response or had my concerns addressed.
50,We had a wonderful trip to the Mirage. We loved the coziness of the hotel and casino. We enjoyed the Beatles LOVE and hope they find a place to continue the show once the Mirage is gone. The Secret Garden is not to be missed either. We dined in our room for all meals due to the risk of Covid and not everyone wearing face coverings. The pantry room service is just awesome. Great food and service. We would have liked to visit the pool as it looked awesome from our room but we ran out of time. The Volcano was pretty cool too. You could feel the heat!
40,We had an exceptional time here at the Mirage. Everyone was very helpful nice and informative. The restaurants we ate at were delicious. I loved the dolphin Aquarium very interesting. The views from our room were breathtaking.
50,Lovely time highly recommend awesome pool and fun time ! Food was wonderful at otero and through out the property ! Can’t wait to return ! It’s my place of choice when we go to Las Vegas ! I’m sad they are selling it
50,The check in process was quick and the staff were friendly and helpful. The room was great with a nice view of the strip and very functional and clean. M life offers made it very reasonable. We ate in CPK and had a good meal. Casino was lively and staff always there to assist .
50,This was our second time staying at the mirage and it definitely didn’t disappoint. The location food options and rooms are great. You don’t have to leave it’s all in one place. We will be back for sure. Our fav place to stay.
40,Very nice staff and hotel. Rooms need some updating. Restaurants are a little pricey. Casino has taken advantage by raising limits on tables and offering less favorable gambling odds. Casino bar staff are extremely professional and geared to taking care of the patrons. And I don't even drink. If they could eliminate the smoke smell it would be a 5 star hotel.
40,Great Location and Room Clean and Quiet also. Too long and different type of Check in for the Restaurant on the first floor for Breakfast limited Restaurant opportunities in Property had to go outside for Meals.
50,It was great love the atmosphere hate to know its changing to hard rock.I hope they keep the California pizza kitchen .great service and location have stayed here for 20 years .it’s close to everything
50,Even though I arrived prior to check-in and the room was not ready I was still able to go through an easy check-in process that would send a text when my room was ready. So I had some lunch and waited within an hour I received a message that the room was ready. Very clean and spacious room with a view overlooking a portion of the strip but also had mountain views off to the left. Overall the hotel is setup very nicely with a good selection of restaurants but with it being in such a great location there are also plenty of other places to eat nearby.    I plan to go back next year as long as I can get the same room for close to the same rate I paid this year. It seems that they have already doubled the rates for this time next year which makes no sense but could be a result of the new Hard Rock ownership that will be taking over soon. Not sure how that's going to work but hopefully they won't change too much other than the volcano. If it seems as though the new owners are price gauging then it may be time to look for a new resort for our annual trip. I've stayed here for the last 7 years and loved it would like to continue that streak.
50,Love this hotel. Great location on the strip. Fantastic pool. Hotel is clean well staffed and the rooms are very comfortable. This hotel is just the right size. Not too big that you get lost Not too small that you don't know that you are in Vegas.
50,Love love Loved it! Going back next month . Great service at the pool. Get to the pool early to get a good chair or pay for the premium lounge chair for a better experience. Breakfast was good . Comfortable beds . Nothing to complain about.
50,Out of all the Hotels I been too the Mirage is number one  Staff was helpful even answering simple questions  I enjoy the environment and the relaxing garden (water)  The appearance was great  The room was great  Cleanliness was great
10,Even after using points to get 2 comp nights I still had to pay $350 even though $200 was just held but still money I didn’t have for souvenirs for my family my view sucked and for such high fees and rates really all you get is a bed to sleep in totally not worth it
50,Absolutely love the Mirage and they have outstanding customer service. The restaurants have outstanding food with great service. The secret garden is great for kids and adults alike and the live cats are absolutely beautiful
50,We have frequented the Mirage for more than 20 years the staff has always far exceeded our expectation’s!  We have considered many of them part of our extended family! Our extended family includes Mary Ann the one person at the Mirage that holds a special place in heart. Willie Hancock our host that goes beyond words to accommodate our every need as we can certainly be very needy! Let us not forget to mention the wonderful limo staff that pick us up and safely deliver us to the the front door of the Mirage every time we return to our favorite special place on the strip the Mirage!
40,There are many newer properties on the strip but there is a coziness to the Mirage. Nice size rooms comfy beds good restaurants & bars and very friendly staff. We have stayed here many times and will continue to stay here as long as we can.
50,I think changing Mirage to a HARD ROCK HOTEL is a MAJOR mistake. I love the atmosphere the serenity the calmness that Mirage projects. Gonna seriously miss this place! Make sure you visit before the end of the year as the volcano wlis going away!
50,We had a great time at the Mirage- it’s a fun place to stay with plenty of things to do. The casino sports book bars and restaurants were all outstanding! Beatles Love was an amazing show! I highly recommend staying there!
50,Room was comfortable front desk employees were friendly the cocktail waitress at the lounge Samantha was fun sweet and attentive both nights we saw her. The employees at the pool were also amazing especially Ethan always ready to take our order. All together a wonderful stay. My only request is to add a refrigerator for guests who bring their own beverages and snacks that need to be kept cold. otherwise wonderful trip.
40,We had a great stay at the Mirage! We attended the Beatles Love show and it was amazing. Super convenient to head from your room before & after the show. Our kids loved the dolphin and lion sanctuary.  My only compliant is the non heated pool. It was too cold for a swim so it made the day at the pool a bummer.  Gorgeous grounds though! We were very pleased with the service and notifications from the app the room was ready. You can even use your phone as the room key through the MGM app.
50,Love this hotel best time we have is when we stay are this hotel love the bars the food the workers everything about this hotel is amazing.. I recommend all my friends and family to come to this hotel :)
50,Friendly and clean I brought my daughter and daughter in law they had a wonderful time I have been to Vegas many many times and still enjoy my time I will definitely be back and stay at the mirage the staff is awesome
40,Hi what a wonderful stay at this property. The staff is the key and I really hope they keep all of them when they build the really big guitar out front. Without them they will lose all of their regulars.
50,For the price this is a five-star place. After going into the Bellagio you will think it's 3 or 4 star but that's not fair. It's clean updated and THE PERFECT location. It's across the street from fantastic shopping (at the Venetian) next door to great shopping (Caesars) a block from the mall (big mall pretty good) and more. It's very close to Bobby Flays (Caesars) Cake Boss (Venetian) and Hell's Kitchen. Very close to the Chandelier Bar (Cosmopolitan I believe). Right near Bellagio's fountain. Really there's no better location on the strip. Loved the volcano too. There are lots of great shows in the near vicinity.
40,The Mirage is a nice hotel on the strip. The Sports Book is one of the nicest on the MGM Resort App. The restaurants in the hotel could use some new ones. The gambling options are limited compared to some of the other hotels on the MGM Resorts app. It is clean and family orientated.
50,When flights became an issue and we needed a place to stay quickly they came thru. Got online cashed in a comp. and all the worries were gone. Top notch room food and gaming. A plus accommodations!!!
50,Ate at every restaurant we could in the house and had a great dining experience at each one! Service was excellent at the bars and slot machines and tables were loose at times. Trip was well worth it and had good packages to see the Grand Canyon!
50,Not the newest - not the oldest Vegas hotel/casino but everything from room accommodations to casino amenities were outstanding! We usually walk and spread out time among several casinos over the week but this time we spent all of our time in the Mirage casino.
50,Great service and comfortable room. Did not like the shower. Our breakfast at The Pantry was delicious and the server was how we like to start the day. Our only disappointment was that the volcano was not operating. Thank you Mirage.
50,Great pool and restaurants. Nice room.  It’s past time to replace the hallway carpeting and update the casino as it’s dark and dated.  Liked the clothing store but was disappointed because the WiFi wouldn’t work to charge my bill to the room.
50,Beautiful hotel immaculate efficient welcoming great staff fun casino. Our favorite. Most beautiful lobby and pool areas on strip. So well run. What happens when it's no longer an MGM property?
40,We really enjoyed our stay at the Mirage. The rooms were nice and comfortable. The only issues were we could hear other peoples doors closing as they were coming and going and they could use more plugs to charge our gadgets.
50,Amazing place to stay on the Strip! The dolphins and tigers are so beautiful as well as the restaurants we’re delicious. Truly a magical place to stay and enjoy all that Vegas has to offer. Not to mention experiencing the heat of the volcano!
40,We had a blast. Carpet was dirty in our room and it wAs loud the last morning but otherwise fantastic. Pool was way too crowded but nice. All staff friendly and helpful. Drinks and food were expensive but we had many other options nearby
10,If you book a suite you will be unhappy. Room had a great deal of deferred maintenance. Plumbing didn’t work. No. Soft water like other hotels in Las Vegas. The charge for everything parking and roll away alone was $200.00 for three night stay. Week drinks in hotel bars. Private restaurants were good. They really cut the corners on this property. People and staff were great. The Love show was fantastic. Stay somewhere else.
40,Chelsea our waitress at our cabanas was awesome!!! Prices are rediculous!! $118 for 4 drinks at the pool before tip!! Room was good. Would’ve liked to have known we could use our mlife card for pints at pool and restaurants after we spent thousands of dollars and literally never ate at a restaurant that wasn’t an mgm resort and the bill for 4 of us to eat was never under $150
50,Check in was fast and easy. Me and my friends got rooms on the same floor. Good location was able to walk to everywhere we wanted to go. The hotel is clean and very nice. The Beatles show was great too staff was also nice there.
50,The Mirage is the best hotel on the Strip. The casino had the best games the show LOVE was superb and we enjoyed the Secret Garden and Dolphin Show. Location is the best next door to Caesar's and Treasure Island. There is a free Tram to get to Treasure Island. The Mirage Pool is outstanding. I cant wait to come back some day!
50,We upgraded to a penthouse suite for our honeymoon. The bed was amazing great sleep. Room was clean housekeeping was on the top of their game. The restaurants were all great - use your MGM rewards at every stop. This is a smaller blueprint hotel - would be nice for people who have a hard time with the walking at the larger properties. The pool area is amazing very relaxing and beautiful. Shame it’s going to be changing soon due to the sale but I will always treasure the memories of the tropical oasis in the desert.
30,Good place for a cheap room if you are traveling with a group or kids. Not where you want to have a bachelor party. It’s lost a lot of its allure. Very basic casino these days. Everything seemed over crowded and slightly too expensive for the quality.
30,Visited the Mirage for a few days after a business trip for some R & R. Like most places in Vegas everything was pricey. Bottle of water $10.00. I drink 8-10 bottles a day. With the cost of food and other items didn't have enough to gamble. Oh well. The hotel common areas were nice and appeared up to date. The room needed a lot updating and repair. Didnt expect that for the price. The lobby is beautiful but the room did not match.
50,The Mirage is amazing. Out of all the hotels I have seen in Las Vegas its by far my favorite one to stay. It has the most beautiful plants and trees all around. Laying by the pool you really do feel like you are in a tropical oasis. Even the pathes you take give the feeling of walking through a tropical forest. The whole place is clean and roomy. Great shops and wonderful restaurants all are easy to find. Staff is all wonderful and friendly too. The volcano is awesome. I highly recommend a volcano view room. You can watch the whole show without the crowds also you get a unique view you can only get from the top. The hotels location is perfect. You are almost right in the middle of the strip. So everything is easy to get to and find.
20,The price for food and drinks is out of this world. A small mix drink cost $24. That drink was nothing fancy. The food was not that great at the hotel. Food was pricey and not very tasty. The staff was great except for check-in. They only had one person helping all of the arrivals.
10,Checked in to my room to find sewage in the sink. Absolutely disgusting. Not much concern shown from staff on front desk.    Upgraded to a supposedly better room which although thankfully had no feces in the sink the bed was rock hard.
40,I had a great family trip. I really liked my room and how cable was provided. Check in was really easy. something they could add is more places to eat food. some of the places are really overpriced. If you want to eat a buffet you have to travel somewhere else. overall there was great services and no disturbance.
50,I highly recommend The Mirage tel/Casino as great place to stay in Vegas. Location on the Strip is excellent .The Cirque de Soleil LOVE performance o Beatles music) is THE BEST sthow in town! We thoroughly enjoyed it. And the location allows easy access to other venues events and sights to see (such as the Big Wheel)
50,The Stay Well side is the reason we are giving it an Excellent.We have try other Hotel and they do not meet are need’s.From the staff to the room’s great experience.You are able to sleep and breath better.
10,There was vomit on the floor in my room when I checked in. Instead of giving us a room comparable to the one I paid for they simply sent a cleaning crew to clean the room again and spray a scent over the throw up soaked carpet. Then when I complained about the rancid smell tried to downgrade my room. My wife and I only went back to the room to sleep for a few hours at night. We left as early as possible and came back as late as possible. It was HORRIBLE. I will not ever recommend anyone to stay here.
20,The rooms are overpriced as is everything else. Service at machines is terrible. Go elsewhere. And don’t be fooled by the room quotes. They want a resort fee when you get there. What is this covering? No idea.
50,I chose mirage because it’s been there forever! The room was clean and beds were extremely comfortable! I would stay there again in a heartbeat! Also the pool was amazing! The only thing I had issues with was ordering poolside and getting it to charge to my room.
50,Hotel is very clean and nice. Lots of great food options. Staff is friendly from the front desk to the restaurant staff. The pools are nice and plenty of shade. My favorite dinning locations are the Still and Diablo.
50,I recently stayed at The Mirage for four nights. The room and bathroom were spotless. Food at The Pantry was exceptionally good. All common areas very clean. Staff friendly and efficient. I highly recommend this property.
40,but they charge for parking ($15.00) should not be. Nickel & diming . Rooms with a view and quiet. Comfortable beds. Choice of restaurants. Friendly staff. Good food but not cheap. This sight is not easy for submitting a review. I'm having to continue typing. Not much else to say except the smoke in the casino is bad. Hard to breath.
50,First time Vegas trip for my husband and I along with a group of friends. This hotel certainly did not disappoint. The rooms were very spacious and amazingly clean. Was very happy to have stayed here since it will be taken over by The Hard Rock café and the volcano show will be no more.  The hotel bars and restaurants we could not fault. Staff could not have been nicer and the pool area is beyond anything we were expecting.  I will enjoy having The Mirage as my first Vegas experience.
50,Stayed three nights at the end of March. Great place to stay! Food Hospitality Room and Great Location on the strip!  Plenty of restaurants on site. Lots of gaming opportunities.  Didn't do the pool this time but I have done it before and it is a top one on the strip!
50,Had an amazing visit with my husband. We absolutely loved the dolphins and tigers!! The pool was really nice and clean. The rooms are very nice and have lots of room in them. Would stay at this hotel again for sure. You most see the volcano show before you leave it was a great show!!
50,It was an excellent stay. I definitely recommend for a perfect get away. The view was amazing and the hospitality was truly welcoming. The whole room was perfectly cleaned and sanatized. I would definitely stay again also its most definitely worth its price.
50,We had such a great time at The Mirage. Staff was friendly hotel was super clean rooms were great. My only complaint is how crowded the pool gets but I assume it’s like that everywhere. Overall we had a blast and would definitely stay here again!
50,Had a very nice stay with clean rooms and very friendly and welcoming staff both in the hotel and by the pool. Appreciated that I felt like we got a good value for our vacation dollar relative to other higher end hotels on the Strip.
10,would stay at another MGM property! This Hotel has had its run and either needs to be updated or get rid of it! Any other MGM property is better than this hotel. I heard Hard Rock bought it out and I think that is a great decision.
40,The Mirage is an older property but is pretty well maintained. The casino is beautiful! The rooms are clean. The bathroom is quite small. There is beautiful foliage surrounding the lobby and casino. They also play great music!
50,First time staying at the Mirage and we were really impressed. All the staff were very friendly and the overall cleanliness was impressive. We would stay again. The rooms were very good size. Good location
50,This was my first time staying at this location. My fiancé and I were there for a short trip for a wedding. He was upset that we did not get to enjoy the room more. Clean room and staff were friendly. Room was beautiful!!!I originally book a King resort room but was upgraded to a presidential suite. Housekeeping was nice.
10,Mold/mildew in my bathroom and hair in my tub. I was changed to a different room but when I arrived to my new room there was a stain on the pillow. I was able to go to Ross and buy myself other pillows and sheets.
50,Excellent check-in experience and nice clean suite. Was given an upgrade to one bedroom tower suite and it was very nice. A little dated but clean. The casino gets a bit crowded and the pool area has plenty of loungers. Overall a nice hotel and would recommend staying. Not sure what it’s gonna be like after hard rock takes over.
40,Just stayed at mirage for 5 nights. Room was clean and in good condition could be updated but mgm just sold this resort so I’m sure hard rock will change everything. Love the location and tropical vibe at resort. Pool was large and very nice only complaint was lake of seating if not at pool by 1030 am hard to get a seat. The 18 and over pool was a 200$ fee for 2 chase lounges crazy. Restaurants at mirage not the best and priced high. Love resort other wise. Would stay again but probably not at hard rock when it changes.
50,The hotel is beautiful starting with the lobby aquarium and ending with the pool area outside. The Meet and Greet experience with the dolphins was fenomenal. The felines in cages seemed sad to me. The volcano view room was excellent. I was very pleased with the housekeeping service. The housekeeper did an excellent job every day of our stay. it is true that the rooms need some maintenance . A faucet in the bathroom was leaking the entire time. What a waste of water! The Love show was magnificent. I think this hotel is an excellent choice if you are traveling with kids because it has so many attractions for them. I truly hope that this hotel continue to be the way it is right now.
50,Nice place to stay. Good location on strip. Rooms are clean and he's are comfortable. Shows a little wear and tear but since they have been bought by another company it wouldn't be in their best interest to upgrade/update at this point. Good selection of dining options.
40,We visited for 5 nights at the end of March.  Hotel was pleasantly busy but not too manic until the weekend when it got very busy.  The resident show when we visited was the Cirque Du Soleil 'Beatles' show. It was fantastic. Visually stunning whether you're a massive Beatles fan or not it's worth seeing.    PROS  Several varied restaurants to choose from.  Decent size gym with plenty of equipment.  The housekeeping of the Rooms was very good.  The front of house areas are clean and tidy and the decor is attractive.  99% of the staff were cheerful and very helpful.  Location is great for going out looking at other hotels and the busy part of the main strip. Plenty of restaurants and bars nearby.  Fire jet display show in the front of the hotel each evening.  Bed was very large and comfortable.  For inexperienced gamblers you can use the quieter times to be taught by the croupiers on the tables.    CONS  Pool closes everyday at 5pm! This is too early  We got DOWN-graded on arrival as the rooms we booked were having work done!  We weren't able to have a room near to the friends we'd come with. We were at opposite ends of the floor.  Bathroom in our Standard King room was very small. You couldn't open or close the door with anyone using the loo.  I emailed the Concierge twice before arrival. Never got an answer to either email.  No tea or coffee facilities in the rooms.  People are allowed to smoke in the casino. Despite good ventilation there's a residual smell of smoke. On several occasions people were smoking large cigars in the bars which stank!
30,Asked for toilet paper. Never got it! Used tissues until the following day. When we let room service come clean our room!    I did enjoy a wonderful poolside massage! I definitely would recommend that! He did an amazing job! Very relaxing in the sun!
10,We had bad services from multiple departments. Starting with front hotel desk room services for rolling beds and also valet. The front desk I had no options for securing Jonny rooms which intern I had to pay an upgrade. Rolling beds they were going to charge us $40 a night per bed. Valet parking was free for my platinum but the valet said they were gonna charge me $30 per night.
50,Beautiful hotel with a great location. Very upset the volcano and waterfalls will be tore down for a ugly a** guitar. Staff was fantastic from the front door to the housekeeping on the floor. Pantry good was really good but your normal Vegas expensive with some items breakfast sandwich was $20 but the salmon dinner was only a couple dollars more wth? But that same note salmon dinner was $22 or 23 and it was really good especially vs normal Vegas prices. Bar prices are on point with normal Vegas strip prices and pushing $15-20 for mixed drinks. Drink offers while playing games were more often than not so that was good. Overall though great time while staying here and my biggest thing is a comfortable bed cause my back gets really sore even on the first night and I slept better than I do at home in bed so that was 1000/10 for me! With great pillows too which I did forget to look and see which ones so if anyone knows a response would be great!
50,Love the tropical theming! Great location on the strip. Clean and comfortable rooms. Windows opened which allowed us to enjoy the spring weather. Excellent heated pool with waterfall features. Enjoyed the volcano show nightly. Staff was helpful and friendly.
50,I have stayed at this hotel for years and it's like home to me. I always enjoy staying here and I know the hotel very well. I love all the amenities and I always have nice people that work there. I will always try and book a room in this hotel first.
40,The Mirage is always a nice play to stay when we visit Las Vegas. It is not too crowded and it is close to a lot of stuff on the strip. The rooms are nice and the staff are friendly. My wife and I will continue to stay at the Mirage for future trips
40,Our favorite casino for the combination of location customer service food options the pool the spa and we like the overall vibe of the resort being in our 40s and 50s.    The Mirage casino like most strip casinos need to figure out that not all customers want to lose their entire budget in one night. Table minimums are way too high. I knew they would be getting higher due to re-openning but it is ridiculous . They are pricing the average gambler--who wants to enjoy some table time at the craps/backjack table--out of the market. Even early mornings to find reasonable table limits is impossible. The fact that casinos have been recording record profits that last few months and the limits remain higher than pre-covid times it is nothing short of greed!!    The ranking of 4 reflects the value of the casion limits only. Other than that the resort has always been our favorite.
50,"Enjoyed a great week's vacation at The Mirage. Looking forward to seeing the new addition of The Mirage in the future. Our last nite we rode the ""High Roller"" and was not disappointed in the reviews we'd read."
50,"Even though the Mirage is showing some signs of aging she is holding up rather well. The staff are fantastic. Friendly and helpful. The restaurants although over-priced if you don't have comps are all really good. It's a shame the Mirage is being taken over by the Hard Rock who will almost certainly ruin the feeling of "" a home away from home"" that the Mirage provides. That plus taking down the iconic Volcano to build a massive guitar tower that will provide shade to the Mirage Tower itself. It's going to block the view of many existing rooms.    Now for the parts that need improvement. The MGM Rewards counter is now combined with the Cashier. There are between 1 and 3 customer service reps for all tier level and new member sign ups. No Gold or higher privilege. Long lines often 1/2 hour or longer. That was extremely frustrating and out of character for the Mirage Customer Care we have grown to enjoy. No Gold or higher line privilege to get into restaurants or shows. Also not what we were used to. They did have Gold and above early entry into the popular pool areas. An area that could use some expanding. It's over-crowded and there are too many young children. Who brings young children to Vegas. Kids in both hot tubs didn't make sense and one of the hot buts only had 3 or 4 of the 16 jets working.    Lastly and the most disappointing part of the experience was the removal of so many of our old favorite slot machines. All were either replaced or not replaced at all. Many of the machines that were replaced were the type that most avid players don't like playing. Gimmick machines. Whoever makes their slot machine decisions needs to have a second look. I get the social distancing requirements may have led to the spreading out of machines but Vegas is packed and un-masked so it didn't make sense to cut the total slots available to be played by half. I was bored of the slots after 2 days. This is not a sustainable business model as avid slot players will find alternatives. Mirage slots do give you a fair shot at winning on occasion unlike most strip resorts. Not like before the pandemic but still ""better than most"" on the strip. I'm sure Hard Rock will mess that up.    If you can afford it upgrade to a tower suite. No wait times for elevators. Rooms are spread out so little or no noise."
40,Nice hotel overall. Only issue is that the room I booked wasn’t available upon check in said they were booked and staff was apologetic considering I booked this for our honeymoon and I had spoke with a representative a week prior to trip to confirm booking of that particular room
50,Highly recommend this beautiful hotel/casino! Very friendly staff and a wonderful experience! Located in the center strip everything you need is in the area! Food drinks casino shows pool and especially the FUN!
50,My 2nd stay at the Mirage. My husband has knee problems and I wanted a hotel that wasn't too big. The Mirage was great. We saw two shows there and dined at two restaurants (Italian and Stack were great) without having to leave the building. Shim Lim and Colin Cloud were amazing! Facility maintenance was prompt is addressing a bathroom lighting issue.  Only issue was the room I booked wasn't what I was assigned. Front desk did a good job compensating me for the discrepancy so all was good. Was disappointed evenng outdoor lounge wasn't open. Enjoyed it during last visit.  Will very likely book another stay. No reason not to! Thank you.
50,Great location on the strip. Wonderful dining options. Nice selection of slots and table games. Staff and employees in all departments very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay there in the future.
50,We have stayed at The Mirage multiple times and have enjoyed every stay. The accommodations staff and location are all wonderful in our opinion. We like the restaurants the casino. Entertainment. And love the pool and staff.
10,Check in process was terrible. They don’t want you to know check in at 3 but can check you in as late as 8pm per the front desk. Here is more characters for the two hundred characters limit. Ten more k.
20,While the room was comped we were placed next to the elevator and the noise was constant and obnoxious all day and night. We lost water for the shower one day and the toilet did not flush on another day. The view was of the rooftop away from anything interesting and the worst thing of all was the eyeshot of Trump Tower in the immediate vicinity which made us almost puke.
50,Had a great time at the Mirage. Love the sports book and the pool area is like none other in Vegas. Location to other casinos is very good. Only major disappointment was that the pool closed at 5pm this year unlike other years when it was open until 6pm.
30,Room was not very clean call to desk about an issue (being locked in stairwell after attempting to use stairs to lobby- not marked as emergency only) was ignored needed a second call and over 30 minutes for someone to open door. Charged for incidentals not used.
40,Stains in room carpet and loose fixtures in Bathroom. Self Parking Confusion in billing for re-entry and visiting of other Hotels/Casinos. Overall good service and friendly staff. Restaurants were great.
50,My stay at the Mirage exceeded my wildest expectations! Everything from the hotel to the casino to the convention I was attending was 1000% fantastic! I can guarantee you that I will choose the Mirage for any and all my future trips to Las Vegas!
50,Hotel was very nice. Location was right in the center of the strip and close to most everything. Had an issue with our toilet in our room when we arrived and the problem was fixed very quickly and completely. Staff was friendly and helpful when needed
40,No complaints nice room decent casino floor restaurants etc.. The fire show at night was pretty cool. Covenient location on the strip right next to Caesars Palace. Would reccomend reserving space at the pool ahead of time as it fills up quick
10,I stayed one night with friends after visiting national parks. We wanted a relaxing pool and hot tub afternoon to unwind. The pool closed at 5pm which was too early for us to use. We were told they wouldn’t refund the resort fee and we could use the pool after checking out and shower there. No shower was actual available which we found out AFTER using it and had already checked out. We were told to use the spa shower which was an additional $30 per person that they wouldn’t waive. I’ll never stay at an MGM property again. No one was willing to help us. We were polite and explained the situation to no avail.
30,Shortened pool hours of 10am-4pm and pool was freezing.    No coffee in rooms.    No toiletries (soap toothbrush shampoo & creme rinse)    No late checkout without $50 fee    No free parking    Hotels should not skimp on the experience when charging $350 a night.
10,Horrible I’ve stayed in better Courtyard Marriotts! This place is geeked with smoke hot rooms closed restaurants a gym  Only open from 8-6? And what was opened is so over priced it’s obvious they’re trying to make up for lost revenue. Not to mention we had 7 rooms of our flood and pipes break.
50,We stayed for the first time for a weeks holiday. Every member of staff we encountered was so helpful & friendly & couldn’t do enough for us. Room was large & overlooked the volcano. The carpet & furniture in the bedroom is a bit tired but didn’t spoil our enjoyment. We had a cleaning issue which I reported & this was dealt with immediately. Big shout out to Blake on Reception who was extremely helpful both on checking in and out. Would love to stay again not sure if this hotel is remaining tho due to the Hard Rock takeover which is a shame.
30,I enjoyed my stay for the most part. The staff was friendly. The casino and the rooms were as nice as I expected. However the hotel skips on some basic comforts that are standard at other hotels in this price range and below. Rooms do not allow for any personal items to be refrigerated. If you want to keep something cold you have to bring a cooler or pay $35 a day for a small fridge. There are no coffee makers in the room. If you want coffee in the morning be prepared to wait in line for 30 minutes at the coffee shop downstairs. The soap shampoo toilet paper and other toiletries were of fairly cheap quality so you might consider bringing your own. Overall I enjoyed my stay but I feel like the hotel could put a little more effort into these basic conveniences and it would elevate the guest experience tremendously.
50,I love everything about this property. I'm comfortable here and like that it doesn't reek of smoke as some others do. Even when I go elsewhere to see a show or have a special meal - I don't have to. Make me smile :-)
50,First time staying at the Mirage. Clean room and casino floor. Great location. Plenty of dining options within the resort or nearby off the resort. Elevators were really fast. We had a suite and there was a refrigerator to store our personal drinks.
10,The room I booked wasn’t available. They downgraded me without even mentioning it and still charged me the higher amount. When I did get to the room the bathroom was disgusting. They moved me to another room and this room the tub didn’t drain properly and I had to stand in water every time I showered. This was brought to their attention twice and nothing was done about it. Pathetic customer service and the front desk staff were unfriendly when issues were brought to their attention.
40,The rooms were clean and most of the staff was friendly and professional. We were here for a business trip. We are not drinkers or smokers so the smoke in the hotel was overwhelming (as it is in every hotel/casino in Vegas) and having a fridge in the room stocked full of alcoholic items we would not drink with no room for other drinks and a $50 restock fee if you took anything out to put your own stuff in there) was inconvenient.
30,This is simply not the old Mirage. yes it is a smoky old casino hotel but the service and things that set it apart have gone by the wayside. Book your next option. We have traveled significantly during covid and in the las few months. This is the worst I have seen it.    Not related to the Mirage bit you need a reservation to do anything in Vegas right now. We wanted to go to the Neon Museum but could not because we did not have a reservation and could not get one. Plan ahead.    Lets start with the good things - The Security staff was amazing at helping locate venues that were open and were very friendly. Judy at the concierge desk is AMAZING!! If you decide this is the hotel for you go see her. When we arrived our room was clean and ready. No mold as others mentioned and everything worked. The coffee at both Starbucks and the Coffee Bean was great. The Sportsbook was great. The bar tender at the pool was great. The staff at Otoro was very attentive.    And now the not so great things:  First:  Most eating places were closed by 3. The options for dinner were the steak house the Japanese restaurant and Mexican. All required a reservation which I could never get. They all had tables with no one sitting at them every night.  Second:  Housekeeping only came once out of a 4 day stay They were in the halls they just did not come to our room. I asked for 3 new towels and was told that was to many. She was very rude. Our room was a terrible mess and a pile of towels.  Third:  if you wanted to order from your pool chair the wait for a drink was over 30 minutes. There were simply not enough pool servers  Fourth:  we arrived and checked in. We were given our room number and key. We were told the wrong number so our key would not open the elevator. Once we called and were given the correct room number everything worked great.  Fifth: after not finding any thing for dinner I tried to call room service and was told they stop serving at 4pm. So nothing there either. Unfortunately I could not leave the hotel.
10,I have travelled from the UK and over the last 20 years I have stayed at the Mirage 15 times I have to say that it seems to not have the quality that it once did staff are indifferent you get one happy and helpful and then you go to the complete opposite ignorant and rude. My last two stop the rooms were not properly ready with previous guests underwear left behind for me and my partner to find. First time you might let it go but the next visit to have the same it is not the best. Don't think the staff were that bothered when I explained that I had experienced this twice now. Check in was great the lad Audrey was helpful and friendly I did not get the woman's name that checked us out but she was rude I have not experienced that level of rude for a while I would normally suggest getting some customer service training not this time she would be sacked if was her manager. No customer should have to put up with level of ignorance. As for wanting to return to The Mirage I don't think so will call in for a gamble but not to stay in one of their rooms. Will not be putting myself through the stress of what type of customer service will I get today or what item the last guest has left in the room for us to find.
40,Friendly staff. Highly recommend the oasis pool lounge reservation. Love show awesome! Only issue was poor nights of sleep from thin doors where anyone (at all hours of the night) can be heard in the hallway as if in your room with you. Lingering smoke in casino causing asthma issues. Otherwise great place.
40,The Mirage has such a refreshing atmosphere with all the plantation. There’s a nice upbeat feeling with people visiting and mulling around and not just staring at the slot machines. It’s a lovely place to visit.
40,We booked our room on a promotion and were bumped up to a nicer room without hassle when the room booked was unavailable.  Mirage is in a great central location with nice pool and friendly helpful staff.
20,Hard Rock Hotels has bought The Mirage Hotel on the strip. The Volcano is no longer active. The famous Mirage Buffet is gone. This place no longer has the attraction appeal it once did.  I booked King Strip View rooms and paid for them on Hotels.com. When we arrived the front desk told me the King Strip view rooms on the front were not available. I told them I booked those rooms 3 months ago. I didn't matter. THEY PUT US IN ROOMS WITH 2 QUEEN BEDS NEAR THE BACK OF THE HOTEL WITH A VIEW OF THE FREEWAY AND POOL. I will never stay here again. There are too many really nice places in LV to stay to put up with this place. The Mirage is no longer a Mirage it has become a turd on the strip.
30,In general it wasn’t the worst hotel but at the same time it wasn’t the best either. It is further down the strip restaurants inside not very good and or as many choices as other Hotels. Asked for an upgrade and if that was the upgrade then that was sad. Staffing was not very friendly and it’s one of the highest costing table games on the strip why would somebody continue to play in their own hotel when they could go across the street or down the way and table games as well as other casino things or not as costly. Our bathroom was very old and the shower did not drain at all. We did not feel staffing was very friendly in general around the whole hotel as well as in the casino. Overall this will not be somewhere we will be staying again on the Las Vegas trip.
20,The Mirage was always my go to location for Vegas trips. This last stay however showed those days may be over. Time and again I had the feeling that the staff was trying to keep things going despite a building that was being starved for upkeep.    At the front desk I was informed I had been upgraded to a better room on the 28 floor and I received a text around 4PM telling me the room was ready. Created cards using the mobile check in (good feature) and went up with my bags. Once the door opened I found a room that looked liked it hadn't seen a remodel since the late 90's. There was a musty smell and looking over the bathroom there was small traces of black mold in the grout for the shower. I also found that half the USB and wall receptacles did not work as well as the laptop to TV console. Step 1 was to go down to front desk and ask for a room swap. Front desk manager told me that she could move me to a better room the next day. She was very apologetic and assured me I would receive a text in the AM indicating new room number. Step 2 was to walk over to the mall and get some aroma wall plugs to mask the smell.    Next day no text. Another walk to the front desk where a different manager again apologized and waived two nights of resort fees. Assured me a text would be sent the next day with the new room. A text was received but instead of a new room assignment it told me no rooms were available and there was nothing more they could do. Out of curiosity looked at the website and there were plenty of rooms available for that night. Threw in the towel and transferred over to the MGM Grand.    Specific cons. Bed made a noise that sounded as if a support was failing every time you moved around in it. All furnishings were scratched and generally looked worn. AC had trouble keeping up with 80 degree Vegas days and could only cool room to 73 during my stay. Bathroom was a complete mess. The in room iron did not work and produced a burning electrical smell when plugged in. The staff I came in contact with appeared friendly and tried to be as helpful as they could however the results always came up short.    Specific pluses. The pool is still one of the best in Vegas. The location is also top notch. The Spa was very good. The tables were priced in a range to be expected for what they are marketing the hotel as ($25 min during the day and $50 after around 19:00 - 02:00.)    In short the Mirage is turning into an old relative with dementia you want to remember them at their best but time and reality are taking over and those memories are fading. It will be interesting to see if the Hard Rock just flattens the whole hotel after they really get a chance to evaluate it. At a minimum the existing hotel will need a complete top to bottom remodeled to bring it up to the rest of its mid tier competition.
20,Good location doesn’t have a food court. Rooms or casino isn’t as nice as the money I payed to stay there. Slot machines were a lot of the same just scattered everywhere. I will not stay at The mirage again.
50,I love the Mirage. The hotel could use a minor face lift. The restaurants casino and pool are all first rate. One of the most iconic hotels on the Las Vegas Strip. Too bad I will never stay there again. There are taking away a beautiful place and turning it into the Hard Rock. Boooo! Shame!! A giant guitar instead of the volcano. Lame.
50,Very pleased.. clean room easy check in big pool close to restaurants. This is my second visit to the mirage and i will always come here in the future. The family enjoyed the pool and the food was great.
20,It was a nice hotel and the rooms were clean but the lobby was quite smoky and there was no avoiding it. You have to go through the casino to get anywhere on the property. I would have thought the ventilation would have been better. We visited the Virgin property Venetian and Caesars and did not experience the poor air quality like at the Mirage.
40,Great location good service. Would book again but would make sure to call more than once with any requests. My room was only cleaned once during the stay. Staff members were outstanding! Pool was nice.
20,The carpeting and furniture everywhere are stained musty old and smelly. The location and the staff were the only good things about this place. The smoke in the lobby and casino area--which you HAVE to walk through in order to get to the elevators--made it impossible to breathe. If you are asthmatic you will probably suffer from an asthma attack here. There are no personal fridges provided unless you have to call for one and even then you will most likely have to pay more. My room safe was closed and locked already making it unusable. The hours of the pool and spa (and gym) are only during 8am-5pm so if you want to relax or use the amenities at night you can forget it. What a colossal waste of money.
50,Mirage is one of the most comfortable hotels in Vegas. It is not so big that you can't find your way around easily. The associates are always very friendly and helpful. It is our favorite hotel on the Strip.
10,Horrible customer service from front desk and pool area. Uncoordinated staff that don’t even know pool time closures and due to private events they randomly close pool area early n screw the customers on it.
50,This is a good place to relax and spend some quality time. The pool is wonderful although they should close the pool later to be able to enjoy it more. The location of the hotel is good and the service is excellent.
50,Friendly staff. Clean establishment. Good vibes! Always helped me and my wife out when we needed it easy check in/out good location on the strip in the middle going north or south on Las Vegas blvd was a piece of cake!
50,The Mirage is a classic hotel. The staff are super friendly and helpful with lots of suggestions. It was quiet the location is fabulous and they have great restaurants. The Beatles show is outstanding and I do hope they do not get rid of it with the new hotel moving in. Rooms were dated/worn seemed that they were not updating with the new renovation coming with is understandable. We would definitely stay here again.
40,Love the hotel! The tropical atmosphere with palm trees everywhere and the pool is super fun with waterfalls! The walk is pretty far from self parking to guest elevators but it’s worth it! Tons of slots and tables to play.
40,Overall a great place to stay. Staff was very friendly. The food was pricey but delicious. The hotel was clean. My room was clean but small. Housekeeping was excellent. Slot machines were fun but horrible. I lost a lot of money playing those 😕.
50,Awesome stay the staff was amazing. It awesome to see the razorbacks win their game in the booking area. Being MGM was a plus for the comps and shows. I would recommend this to anyone and will stay here sgain
40,Good location on the strip next and across other big and nice resorts and across affordable restaurants. Thermostat in guest room could not be lowered past 65F however the window could be opened slightly to let in more air and cooler temperature.
40,We had little or no expectations. Every step of the way we were impressed. The hostesses at Diablo were HORRIBLE. Did everything they could do to NOT earn our business. But the wait staff and bussers made it possible to move a table and turn our table of 2 to a table of 4.
50,It was a company funded trip on Friday and Saturday and Sunday we made it a couples weekend and had so much fun. A lot of games and tables to play at and great food. Close to a lot of fun things to do.
20,The food was so expensive and not up to normal standards. This hotel was not customer friendly. The slot machines were way to technical and they were not customer friendly as well. Please do not go to Vegas expecting it to be the way it used to be because it is NOT!
50,From the moment you pull up in this nostalgic hotel you experience friendly helpful staff. The property is clean and well maintained. The casino is diverse and balanced with slot machines and card games. We tried every restaurant with heritage being our favorite. Make sure you sign up to be an MGM member and use it everywhere you can in the hotel. The pool is perfect with enough seating for everyone. The drinks were amazing and strong. I recommend renting a cabana if you’re able as that was one of our best days in Vegas. The property is centrally located on the strip and perfect for walking. If you’re looking for the real Las Vegas atmosphere stay here!
50,I will definitely stay at the Mirage again. The staff was friendly the casino and rooms were very clean the pool area was beautiful and the food was delicious. I recommend the Mirage to a coworker today.
50,One of my most favorite hotels on the strip! This place is beautiful and the price is reasonable. I love it here and would stay again as well as recommend to others looking to stay at a great spot on the strip!
30,When we arrived to room there was dirty tissues in the bathroom floor. There were no outlets near the bedside. For heavy sleepers it’s hard to hear the alarm clock from across the room. It didn’t help that the alarm clock didn’t work. Also after one use of the shower it clogged. We were waiting for water to get warm because that also took a bit and before I noticed water was building up almost pouring out of shower area.
40,Great for the short business trip the staff and the restaurant staff are outstanding - better than the Win and the Venetian. The restaurant staff were always happy helpful and made the experience special.
40,Pay attention when you check in some of the newer employees at the front desk don't no how to go about some things but overall it was a very pleasant atmosphere an the pool was amazing along with the front desk aquarium
50,Was here for a wedding. Had a good time. Hotel was nice rooms where clean. Plenty of things to do in the area. Staff always friendly and never seemed annoyed when asked questions. Over all had a good weekend.
50,Willie haddock is a great host look him up an request him. Also coco the cocktail server is wonderful. The pool was amazing am so were the hot tubs. Was there for work with restaurant bar trade show. The steak house an the Italian restaurant were really good an worth every penny.
30,This was my return to Las Vegas after more than 10 years. I expected some differences. It has been 10 years & a pandemic and the changes are very visible. Not just at this hotel but all of Vegas. Gone are the days of nonstop gambling briefly interrupted by great buffets and awesome food at cheap prices. Hotels enticed you with great buffets and cheap meals just to get you in the doors to their casinos. Not not not here or at any other casino that I went to. There are other things to do in Las Vegas so go ahead and do them but remember to save a kings ransom for meals. At the Mirage the people at the front desk are friendly and seem to be empowered to help the guests. The hotel is clean & has visible security. I play slots nonstop but my biggest loss was at the restaurants. Overpriced understaffed and average food. Breakfast for two on the first morning of room service was close to $100. Nothing fancy eggs bacon & toast. They have a few restaurants to choose from including a Starbucks. They are right on the strip so there are other places you can eat within walking distance. The room was comfortable & clean. The lobby and all common areas are also well kept.
30,3 of the lamps weren’t working in our room. Several USB ports were also not working. Overall the room was decent. However I expected better quality considering the room rates. I previously stayed a night at the Mandalay Bay it was half the price and twice the quality and experience.
10,Terrible customer service! Room wasn’t clean had to call housekeeping since the bathroom looked like it hadn’t been cleaned. Tried to upgrade room at check in and front desk manager was rude and disrespectful. Will never stay here again.
50,The mirage is our favorite moment resort to stay. Everything is easy to find food is good. All of the staff from front desk to the casino and housekeeping even all of the restaurant employees have great customer service and very friendly.
50,Very professional receptionists ( check in and check out ). Roomy bedrooms very clean. Beautiful decoration in the room and within the hotel complex. I'd highly recommend this hotel great location in Las Vegas! Keep up the good job!
50,First time to Vegas and had the best experience. Room was great casino was great all staff went above and beyond. Everyone who traveled loved the experience. Will definitely be returning sometime in the near future!
50,Back in Vegas after a two year lockout I am glad that everything it's coming to normal  our stay in the Mirage was excellent we finally went to see the Beatles show overall we did enjoy our stay looking forward for next year
10,The Mirage has clearly decided to trick you. They tempt you to sign up for rewards and promise benefits only to make you “earn” them. They talk you in circles. Go elsewhere. There rooms were subpar. A/C barely worked. Showers were gross. Shampoo left hair greasy. Hallways are loud at night.
10,The staff was so so kind and we really appreciated that but we were so disappointed with so many things. One of which being…We had been driving all day and were so excited for our stay and especially for the gorgeous pool which was the main reason we chose to stay there. We got there took an hour nap and woke up an hour later to find out that the pool closed at 5 PM?…. We only had one night and was beyond disappointed. I was happy to pay the price of the resort fee and everything without complaint but I also expected to be able to use the accommodations I was promised.  It was supposed to be a romantic getaway and instead felt like a big flop. We also had a cooler full of food from our road trip and was so thankful that there was a fridge but thank come to find it’s all weight sensitive and doesn’t even have enough room for our string cheese. All of our food went bad and became inedible by the next day. It made me sick having to throw away all that food. Im so bummed that the experience was so rough. I had so many hopes. It was my Fiancés big birthday surprise and it just did not live up to any of the expectations. So dissatisfied and disappointed.
50,The hospitality is amazing especially housekeeping and banquet services. Everyone is helpful and friendly. In a great place on the strip and close to everything. They run it very well and it was a comfortable stay.
50,Good stay clean room great fitness room. Was crowded but that’s Vegas. Really need to open fitness room for longer only open spa hours 8-5. Room was clean sports book had plenty of seats for march madness.
30,Not advised when room was ready after i checked in early. Had to wait 7 hours. Staff at restaurant (not going to name) so rude. Brought friends and other restaurant split our check wrong and other restaurants not open.
50,The Mirage is a great hotel. It is conveniently located on the strip. Affordable nice rooms plenty of amenities and a great pool. All of the staff were very nice and helpful. Would definitely stay again.
50,Enjoyed having everything we needed and wanted all in one wonderful place. Love the dolphins and the shows and the restaurants and the rewards that MGM gives to us! We had made our reservations and were very excited that we were given a food upgrade! So very happy with the mirage!
20,Other than the nice location on the strip not much positive to say about this tired old resort. Woke up every morning to a neighbor's noisy bathroom fan and ours was just as loud. Had to trapse through a chaotic smoky noisy casino every time you went to and from the hotel rooms. The room was nothing special Even though I was attending a meeting and got stiffed for a daily resort fee the pool was only open limited hours and not available to those attending the meeting for early morning or after the meeting swims. There are lots of better cleaner and up to date places to stay on the Vegas strip for the same price. The wrecking ball can't come too soon for this relic.
30,The hotel is fine. It's not a dump by any stretch but a little outdated and tired. The pool doesn't have enough chairs for all guests on a sunny day. The dessert shop doesn't have any cake left at 10pm. It's all just a little rinky dink. But the location is great and we were not uncomfortable in the rooms.
50,Entire casino was very clean and inviting. Room was clean comfortable and well maintained. Staff extremely attentive and friendly! Was attending a conference meeting rooms were very nice food was great. Suitable for families too. Slots could’ve been a bit nicer lol!!!
10,I have currently been sitting here on hold for 1 HOUR and 28 MINUTES! I am trying to upgrade our show tickets but am still sitting here on hold. This has got to be hands down the worst customer service ever!
10,Super outdated hotel some of the craps table employees are not super friendly. $15 for a water bottle and $45 resort fee for a completely outdated experience. Not worth the money and the overall experience is pretty underwhelming. Would not go back again.
40,I had a good stay at the hotel. The hotel was clean and not loud at night in the halls. In a great location for walking distance to everything which makes it very convenient. Maybe needs a little bit of updating in the rooms but not bad
50,We highly recommend the Mirage! Great location awesome pool casino floor is a nice size rooms and restrooms are super clean. Staff is friendly the LOVE show was amazing! Definitely a must see while visiting Vegas.
40,"Everything was wonderful except when our Concierge made a recommendation and booked us dinner at Stack. Once at Stack I had the Worst Dining experience in recent history. the food was ok the Company was great the Waitstaff was atrocious I have never once wanted to tip a penny but in this case I had a strong desire to do so I had to in fact hand the entire bill of $500+ dollars that I covered over to my wife who works in the service industry to be an impartial judge. I was so upset and the manager or whoever just gave me a free Budweiser for my troubles. This was unacceptable and honestly I will make sure to let everyone know not to go to the Mirage restaurants because they clearly don't care about their business. We were dressed well not a bunch of yahoos and frankly didn't deserve that type of disrespect from the wait staff. especially somewhere that is considered ""fine dining"". Soooo upset the waiter never showed up again for an hour never looked me in the eye and the manager could care less.    I guess when you go to eat at the Mirage they treat you like a Troglodyte a piece of Trash and act like we should be serving them. Not what I consider good service at a place that I shell out 500+ for dinner to be treated like that. Complete abhorrent behavior and disregard for people's time and frankly performing your job at an acceptable capacity."
50,Great location rooms clean TV worked except of friday when we were leaving Toilets flushed pillows were soft overall we enjoyed our stay. Casino was clean Valet was helpful bathrooms were very clean.
50,Every staff member was very helpful some even going above and beyond. I wished I would have stayed here for my whole trip instead of only for one night. I am disappointed that the Mirage will be replaced with a Hard Rock casino.
50,Great hotel. Lots of loud drunk people. Doors slam everywhere. Weather stripping for door would be a nice sound barrier. It’s Vegas what do you expect? I hear ya!    I don’t like how they try and get you to spend more money in the room with snacks. It’s just silly but if it’s profitable then I guess I’m wrong from a business standpoint.
50,We had a very nice stay at The Mirage. The room was clean and the location was great. We loved the view of the strip and of the pool from our room. We were also able to watch the dolphins for our window.
50,everything good and rooms very cleangood service the casino and the all place very beautiful the view in my room it was nice the good vibe we going back very soon thaks for everything the parking a little far away but with the pearl free
50,I want to again thank Alex Zanetti for her wonderful service and help This was a very memorable trip to Las Vegas because of the Paint the Dolphin experience made possible by Alex and MGM  So nice to be appreciated as a loyal customer of MGM  Alex thank you!!!!
40,Room looked really nice. A little dirt on the floor but overall the room was fantastic. The bathroom looked very clean. Check-in and check-out was pretty fast. Slot machines also were paying me.
20,The hotel was everything it’s been before. I love stayed here everytime I’ve come to Vegas because of the vibe. However this stay well suite was just gross. Covered in dust my phone would have specks of dust as it was set down. My breathing impacted everytime I came back into the room and allergies would swell. Even with the air purifier on the dust and dirt of the room was bad. The lamps covered in it you could pull off dust by running your finger across them.
50,We stayed at the Mirage for St Patricks Day and the first round of the NCAA basketball tournament. The Mirage provided everything we needed for a great weekend away. The atmosphere was fun the food options were delicious the staff was friendly and our room was roomy and clean.
30,While we booked The Mirage since we were going to see The Beatles Love show we were not overly impressed with the room. It was fine; but I have stayed in more mediocre rooms for less money. I suppose you are paying for the location of this hotel but it was average at best. Husband was disappointed by lack of refrigerator or coffee maker in the room.  The check in/out on the app was incredible and so easy. I was able to add the parking fee to the room via the app and once I got the hang of it using the key for the room via the app was also easy. We truly didn't encounter any staff while we were there so can't necessarily comment on the friendliness or helpfulness there. The location of The Mirage is great and of course easy to walk to numerous places. There was always plenty of parking available in the deck.
40,Great location to use as your base while doing things on the strip. Clean fun good food options great sports area and good staff. The casino has everything you need and the vibe is just loud and fun.
30,Although you need key to go up to your room there is no security at elevators. We saw prostitutes waiting by elevators to be let up—so disgusting! After seeing this staying in my own room grossed me out. Also too many loud and obnoxious guests!
10,Threatened to give away my room if I wasn't checked in by 11:00 even though the room was already paid for. Received a complimentary fridge that nothing could fit in no blankets on the beds or even in the room volcano was a big let down. Also very thin walls.  Felt very run down for MGM property will not stay there again.
30,The are where the hotel is is nice  the only things I didn’t not like was the way the room was cleaned  the bed sheets had stains and the bathroom wasn’t cleaned properly . The air conditioning wasn’t working that well so it was kinda hard to sleep with a hot room .
50,Covid has not effected customer service at The Mirage Everuyone from front desk to card dealers could not have been more welcoming or attentive to our needs. It was our first time at this MGM property although I think we have stayed at all of them now. We look forward to our next trip and staying there again.
50,Every employee we encountered at the hotel was friendly and helpful. The rooms were the cleanest we have seen in awhile in fact all the MGM properties were back to the cleanest we were used to in the past. Our last visit we were not as impressed but the was during COVID so they might not have had the manpower. It was so nice to see the hotels back to normal
50,This hotel was beautiful with waterfalls and beautiful flowers. Lots of restaurants to choose from. Many bars and very big casino and being right on the strip was so convenient. Was right across the street from Fat Tuesdays Walgreens and outback steak house for a reasonable dinner.
50,I absolutely LOVE the Mirage!! It’s my favorite hotel to stay at when I’m in Vegas!! It’s the perfect location has the best pool friendly staff and great restaurants!! I’m so sad it’s transforming into the Hard Rock. I feel it’s a big mistake to get rid of the Mirage.
20,Very bad to sleep to much noise walls banging kids screaming not enough toilet paper toilets not clean floors not that clean in the room bad odor will not stay here again . The banging in walls very early morning it seemed like working on something
50,Excellent last minute spring break choice for me and my daughter. Lots of great things to do obviously. Tremendous food at Osteria Costa and Diablos.  Milly P at the front desk was extremely helpful. Really pleased with the room rate and the service was excellent
30,Staff was helpful and friendly in all areas of the hotel. Grounds and pool area are large and have a lush feel with all the palms. Volcano show was fun. Restaurants Pantry and Diablo were both good but annoyed they do not take reservations and cannot get on wait list over the phone. Annoyed parking is not free for guests at the hotel. Annoyed A/C in room needs night time to finally be able to cool the room. Location is good for seeing the sites of northern Las Vegas Strip. Seems like the best value for the location.
10,The Mirage might have been the hotel to stay at 30 years ago; but not anymore. It's a dying hotel. The room had a cig smell to it. The hallways on the floor had weed smell. There was lack of room service. The TV in the room had connection/reception issues. They lack of a poker room now. Checking out at the front desk had mistakes. I was charged for parking for my stay even though I have pearl status for my M-Life.
30,The pool is FREEZING!!! Rooms are noisy you can hear everything including the elevator going up and down. We paid over $400 and the same cost at Mandalay Bay or Bellagio is WAY BETTER. The pool is beautiful no umbrellas unless you have a paid chair.
30,Staff was friendly and helpful casino was in good shape but very outdated . The guest rooms could use some updating they were fairly old. Enjoyed having places to sit  visit and relax where you still were inside the casino and hotel but not at the tables. Could put more of those in as all of them were busy people like that and they could be open perhaps all day not just evening. Some outside areas like that would be nice too not just at the pool area where you could sit outside. Thank you
40,Rooms are dated but the staff and pool are great! Wish the pool was heated but it is warm enough in the summer. Great food and rewards program. Will be sad when the mirage changes over to hard rock. Make sure to see the volcano  before they remove it.
50,The Mirage has kept itself relevant up to date and fun for decades. Upgrading rooms restaurants and most recently completely streamlined the check in process where you can check in on the MGM app with in app room key. It's incredible!
50,Stayed at the Mirage for the 1st weekend of March Madness and my son's bachelor party (15 guys total). Great service and the friendliest staff you can imagine. Rooms were terrific and clean. Location is great and we were treated exceptionally well by everyone.
50,Loved my stay at the Mirage. Staff is professional and efficient hotel conveniently located rooms have all the comfort. I managed to squeeze a performance by the cirque du soleil in the same premises and last but not least the explosive surprise of a volcano erupting in front of me :)
50,Great  fantastic sports book  really great rooms and suites with fantastic restaurants and amenities    Room service was delivered timely and had a great menu and the cleaning staff kept our room impeccable for a really large group
50,The Mirage has it all! This perfectly located resort has everything you need for a stay in Las Vegas. Great restaurants The Beatles Love Cirque du Soleil show plenty of gambling opportunities if that is your thing great service and attentive staff make this the perfect spot to stay while visiting Las Vegas.
50,Hotel was super busy but the rooms and staff were top notch. Restaurants were all delicious and pool was super relaxing. East to walk everywhere we needed to go. Would definitely stay there again in the future
40,I recently stayed here for a couple nights while in Las Vegas. The property is a nice compromise versus some of the newer more expensive casinos. Casino and property feel upscale but the rooms are in need of a facelift. Old furniture and design. I would still stay again knowing what is being offered. Next to Caesar’s walking distance from most relevant attractions on the strip.
40,I could definitely tell the age when I first entered the room. If you looked closely some of the paint was cracking. The carpet looked faded the mini-fridge doors was hard to close etc etc.    I still had a great stay overall though. The location is absolutely top notch and the service was fantastic. While dated the room was more than comfortable/clean enough for us.
50,Great place to stay. The pool is great although it was a little cool in March. Room and Casino were clean. Lot of great places to eat. Recommend The Pantry The Still Diablos and their snack restaurant. Staff was friendly and helpful.
50,The Mirage was beyond expectations! Never having stayed there we tried a Penthouse Suite and it was everything you can imagine. Very clean rooms and very modern. Casino was kind to us. We will return for sure!
40,Great location. Old bathroom. Good time. It was a good middle ground hotel. Not as nice as the top tier but it’s all about the location. I’m just trying to fill out the 200 minimum character count. Would recommend
10,My experience was ruined by Blake at the front desk of the Mirage. I’ve stayed at several MGM properties and have loved my stays. On my last day at the Mirage I noticed a mysterious charge on my account that wasn’t something I changed to the room. I had changed several meals to the room so I wanted to make sure it was legit. I went down to reception and spoke to Blake. I told him there was a $15.00 charge to the room I didn’t recognize and wanted to find out what it was. He said it was a charge from the mini bar in the room. I said I didn’t have anything from the mini bar. He and his coworker shared a glance at each other at this point. Like oh sure you didn’t. He looked back at his screen and said you didn’t have a bag of peanut m&m’s. I said of course not. What I didn’t mention was I’m allergic to peanuts so there’s no way I ate them. He glanced back to his computer and said ok it’s gone. Up until this point I would have been fine with the exchange but as I’m walking away from the counter I hear him say to his coworker yeah right and they both start laughing. I know it’s just one employee but it says so much about the company to treat someone that’s spent tens of thousands of dollars at their properties and is a possible future guest. I hope Blake at MGM treats you better than he did me.
10,Hotel is looking tired. Hard to get a drink while gambling. Harrahs across the street was much better. Location is the only benefit of staying there. A lot of newer/better places to stay. Gambling machines were very tight. Two hot dog sodas and fries cost $52.
30,My family and I were accommodated in the Stay Well rooms. Despite the claims of a more relaxing experience after long travel we were greeted with an average room with an air purifier that needed an new filter an aromatherapy that didn't seem to minimize the hallway street and adjacent room noises.
30,I did have some problems with our bathroom but the staff was quick to assign me another room which I had no problem with. The problems were: very slippery shower floor loose shower water handle loose water spicket in sink and no handle on the interior side of the door.
50,As old as the resort was it was very well kept. Grounds and casinos were very clean rooms were nice and big. Hate to see a property like this go. My only gripe is how small the bathroom was in my standard room. Other than that excellent property.
50,The Mirage is iconic Vegas! We have stayed at almost every hotel on the strip and this was our first stay with the Mirage. It’s now our new favorite and we can’t wait to go back! The food and drinks were great!
50,Everyone and everything is great here my sons had amazing first trip from the checking in to the food and location and omg the pool and it was easy for us do things and get places and we had a view of the dolphins from our room
30,The bed was uncomfortable we asked for extra shampoo and to get help getting into the fridge… nobody ever came! The pool closed at 5 so we didn’t get to use it but got to pay the ridiculous resort fee.
20,"I did not get the room I was confirmed for. I asked why  I was given ""Sorry "" we gave your room away even though it was reserved. I asked to upgrade and I would pay the difference first I was told ok and then told not available by management. Very poor customer service!!"
40,Recently I had friends staying more mid strip so I decided to stay at Mirage. It has been 20 plus years since I have been inside Mirage and never stayed there. The property has been well taken care of the room was clean with a comfortable bed. The overall layout of the casino is good and not confusing. Hope to stay there again soon and spend more time enjoying the casino.
50,It was a Great Atmosphere! Location on the strip was awesome. Staff was amazing as well. They had all our favorite slots the room’s were clean and they had a lot more tv channels than any other hotel we’ve stayed at before. I would definitely stay here again!
30,They told us the pool was heated so we booked a family vacation for four days and planned to spend two of them by the pool relaxing while the kids swim ate etc.. No heated pool = 2x budget spent in Vegas staying busy with kiddos.
50,We traveled for the first time to Vegas. Decided to stay here since its probably the last chance we will have. LOVED IT!. Its one of the smaller resorts but definitely a great experience. I would recommend to anyone who wants to visit. Also buy some chips like I did. They have the Mirage logo on them Great as a sue venire.
50,Amazing location five minute walk to Caesars Palace The Venetian and Treasure Island. Hotel has everything you need huge pool with plenty of beds and great waiters. Bedrooms relatively modern GREAT views of the strip. Lifts to the rooms great plenty of them so no hanging around. Staff all lovely. Would definitely return.
30,Bed was comfy restaurants in hotels were delicious staff was decent...but you don't get a useable fridge in the dang room. I don't know how much money that could possibly save a company but that single choice will mean I am not going to return to this hotel on my next trip.
40,Had a short stay…Mon-Wed…Shin Lim/Colin Cloud show was awesome. The ease of check in/out on the app was flawless. Good food…but need more breakfast spots. Heard it was being tore down in the next 3 years…what a shame.
10,Old outdated short staffed. Need more? Most places to eat were closed. Not the same quality hotel/casino it was. I waited in line to cash out chips for over 10 minutes and there was 1 cashier and 7 people in line. No-one cared to rectify the issue.
40,fun casino lots of new food venues open now just have to look for them most are in back of the casino near the rooms. drinks dont come that often and no refridge in room or coffe maker. there is room service during morning and lunch not sure about dinner time
30,see previous comments. should not have to type it all over again. One other thing -since you have to walk through the Lobby to get to guest rooms all the smoking you allow is offensive and not healthy
50,The Mirage is a classy fun resort. Every employee encounter ws positive from the valet to the front desk to HK to room service delivery...all were very friendly and efficient. The room was comfortable with a great Strip view...  We love Heritage Steak...both the food and service were excellent with a decent wine list.  Really gate to see The Mirage go away and become just another glitzy Hard Rock property.
50,Just love this property. It's in the center of the strip it's clean and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Gaming was fun and good didn't win a million but I never expect that in Vegas. Upgraded our room to a strip view and was able to watch the volcano from the comfort of our room.
40,The hotel was clean and well maintained. Customer service was polite and helpful. Check in was easy I did it on the mobile app. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were nice. Beware of the refrigerator do not add or remove anything if you don't want to be charged. The refrigerator weighs its contents to charge. Other than that we ate at the Italian restaurant and it was very good. We also hung out at the bar and danced quite a bit to the good music.
30,The room was very hot. We had the air set at 68 degrees but remained at 74 the whole time we were there. There wasn’t a price list for the mini fridge. It is a long walk to the hotel rooms from the parking garage.
50,Great location... center of strip.. have stayed multiple times.. Great stay! Awesome pool... but the Oasis adult only pool is the best.. rented chairs worth it.. Great poolside service... Diablos cantina for great mexican food... The Still had awesome nachos and drinks... fun atmosphere.
20,As most of us now the location is great and mirage was a las vegas staple. But now It's just overpriced Based on one simple fact it's a dump they've done nothing to make it better because they don't care. Just find ways charge you For everything they can because they know you're never coming back. heck they have a tax in the resort fees. Its All about nickel and diming you. at now what is a motel they call a motel? Why is this happening well MGM sold this property and it's sort of in lingo right now. so nobody who works their cares about the customer. Nobody not even managers care about service or getting you to come back. Mgm should still care but they dont. because they no longer have skin in the game and it's gonna take adon't. while for the hard rock to take over full control. Who even knows what hardrock will even do with the mirage to make is vist worthy if anything at all. It seems as if it's all about just robbing you blind On everything from a bottle of water to some of the worst food we ever ate. Look I'm a gambler that loves to spend money gambling. No problem spending but i want to have a good time in a nice environment and be entertained. So after loving the mirage for 20 years i say this.. you're taking a huge gamble just staying in a room here. So right now my advice is to stay somewhere else on the strip. You will spend less and get more the mirage has nothing else to offer but horrible service food and lodging in a boring environment. Stay somewhere else until 2026 maybe by then they'll figure out about customer service how to upkeep their rooms especially the suites. Get some good food and a  Fun gaming experience we all want from Vegas. But for now mirage has officially failed us!
10,This resort is a very cheap and unfriendly place. The pool closes at 5 and the beds are rock hard. I even had the cashier refuse to pay me my winnings saying I stole the chips?!?!? And made me gamble my money more before they finally paid out. Screw this place.
30,"Hidden cost apply. We tried to find something without hidden cost as a lot of people warned with caution. We thought we selected the one specifically without any additional charges but still to our surprise the first thing the reception brought forward was ""extra cost"" $88 for 2 nights. We didn't argue just wanna have peaceful 3 days in LV.    Room is still OK but do not compare it to the new hotels like Resort World. Things are getting ""old"" and you get to see some obsolete stuff like the connectors.  Refrigerator is packed with the items that you have to pay even if you ""move"" it. At least give us some space for our own food and drinks that would be nice.  For the price we paid we could've stayed in better hotel.  Nevertheless we are not high rollers why bother."
10,Just don’t stay here. The staff act like gangsters and are terrible with making you feel comfortable. The only good thing is the place was clean. Other than that they barge in your room even if you paid for extra time and they ask you why do you need things. They yell at your kids and tell them to get out but when confronted lie and say they just asked where they’re going.
10,"I recently stayed at this hotel over the weekend I payed for A strip view the view was completely ruined by huge coffee stain on window! informed staffed they did nothing about it and acted as if it was not there problem! Even the manager was very ruined and acted as if the did not care ""Saying what do you expect us to do about it"" I am a rewards member at MGM and was treated like crap by staff won't be staying here ever again don't waste money! go stay at Bellagio they treat you with way better respect!!!"
50,"Just returned from a 3 night stay with no problems or issues.  I had some reservations about staying here after reading many reviews but we had no problems at all.  Check in was friendly and efficient given an excellent room and location. Volcano view on 22 floor at the end of the hallway so nice a quiet  Room was very clean and comfy with a king bed two night stands two dressers table and chairs.  Safe was broken but maintenance came quickly and got it working for us  Bathroom was on the smaller size but clean and had very nice thick towels  As with all Las Vegas hotels the lack of coffee in the rooms is annoying and having to wait till 630 am and pay $5 for coffee but it is what it is!  Only tried a few food options and all were good and large portions  Casino was smoky but also very busy with lots of tourists.  Spent some time at a few bars with poker machines which about half of them were broken  Saw Beatle's ""Love"" great show!  All employees we encountered were friendly and helpful.  The place was spotless! Everywhere you went was clean well maintained and spotless!"
30,This is hotel is on the strip walking distance from other attractions volcano show was great! Room looked old and need updating. Wallpaper was peeling off bathroom was outdated and had minimum toiletries just shampoo conditioner and not even a soap/body wash
10,Rude unhelpful staff. Room was dirty hair in the sink and in the shower. Door keys stopped working the first night I called the front desk they told me I would have to come down to the desk as they were to busy to send new keys up to the room. I had to call the front desk 2 days in a row to request that the mini bar in my room be unlocked.
40,The Mirage is a great hotel. Location is very convenient for many of the major hotels and activities on the strip. Great rooms and excellent service. We have stayed here many times and will return in the future.
40,I have been staying at this hotel for the past 3-4 years now and hands down I feel it’s one of the best old casino’s the vibe is just Vegas without the snarky/upscale just a chill hotel and friendly staff.
10,the visit was not great at all i felt that i was unwelcome in the casino  more did not offer me water coffee are beer are anything without asking for it i felt the race card was used i am a proud black person
10,Did not get the calue for money spent. Stayed on a non-smoking floor but constantly got smoke and marjuana smells coming through our hvac. The rooms are old and dated for the money spent. On a positive note the staff was friendly and tried their best to assist with issues.
20,We stayed for our 7th anniversary and walked into a room that carpet looked as if it hasn’t been vacuumed in weeks. We also asked to be moved across the hallways for a view of the strip since we were staying for a week. I was promised a move Saturday and it never happened. I have called and complained and was told there was nothing they could do. We will be returning next month and I would love to stay at the mirage because that’s our place however if they can’t hold up on their deal I refuse to give them any of my money.
50,we had a lovely stay at the mirage. everyone was very warm and accommodating. the food at Heritage and Costa were both excellent. the room was large and clean and comfortable. we will definitely return.
30,The checkout staff is horrible. They have no customer service skills. If you think you think you might have to use their in person checkout stay somewhere else. The rooms are clean and nice and all staff but checkout staff are kind and responsive.
20,I was so excited that Mirage was under the Hyatt hotel chain and couldn’t wait to visit. The cost was over $300 night and with all the fees it came to $376 a night.  The moment we walked into the room we were disappointed. I immediately called the front desk and asked if we could change the rooms. It did not look like the photos at all. The room looked tired and dark. The front desk told us the hotel was 30 years old and all the rooms looked the same. We didn’t get another room. Also there was a strong smell of Lysol cleaner that was similar to the public restrooms smell that never left the room.
50,The atrium and lobby exceptionally clean. Check in process at 4pm was fast and worry free. MGM rewards staff was very helpful. Otoro and Stack really good food options onsite. Layout of casino is great. Not to small not to large. Stay Well rooms are our favorite. Pool is amazing. 3rd time staying at the property. Only negatives are non poker room small bathrooms in standard rooms and that it will no longer be an MGM property.
10,I called for a nice room at the ARIA  well they were booked and they recommended this dump..I had visited them about 20 years ago..and remembered it was nice...for 6000 a night it was nice 20 years back..since they haven't done a thing to this place..it's ugly..they ripped me off. The salesman who sold me the 2 days for 13000 sent me pictures of this place from 20 years ago..not a worn out dump that it is now...I warned you guys.
40,The casino and hotel were adequate if a bit older. The restaurants were good as well. We were in Vegas for a conference and we typically like to work out first thing in the morning. It was very irritating to find that the fitness center was located in the spa and was inaccessible before 8am.
40,No microwave or mini refrigerator in room. There would be an upcharge if hotel provided one. Everything else was above and beyond.... check-in staff was GREAT and cheerful. I would definitely stay here again!
50,I started staying at the Mirage in 1990 and the consistent quality of service room comfort and staff friendliness have kept me coming back for over 20 years. There have been many new properties built along the strip but for a great experience and value I keep coming back to the Mirage.
50,Had a great time the employees were so nice and polite from the people at the front desk to the housekeeping casino workers and even the security guards were smiling and seeming to be having a great time.
50,We came to Las Vegas for the NASCAR race and stayed three nights at The Mirage. Great location on the strip delicious restaurants in the hotel and we won $1500 on the slots! Our room was clean a comfy bed quiet and had a great view of the strip! We will definitely be back!
50,We had the best time ever! Andy upgraded us to an amazing room. We got in very late and ordered room service from the pantry and the food was delicious and we actually ordered a second time and it was amazing. We won $175 from $125 in slot dollars. Venetian and harrahs are right across the street.
40,We had a great time seeing Shin Lim and Colin Cloud…truly amazing! The room was nice but the bed could have been more comfortable and it needed a blanket. The shower rattled when it was on.  The best food was at The Pantry where the quality was very good and the service was very good as well.
50,Connie from hawaiii Carlos from Costa Rica Dorothy and mulu gave me the best casino experience anyone could ask for. They were super sweet and down to earth we need more people like them in this world. Great job hiring them they deserve a raise!  -Melissa
50,This hotel was really great easy to navigate through! The secret garden was absolutely mind blowing! We couldn’t believe the dolphins. It’s a must! The bed was not great but the rooms were clean and on the bigger size! Definitely would stay again.
50,It was great good time exalent environment entertainmentthe party'sand slot termeants are fun everyone is very friendly the food was delicious the drinks get you in a happy light footed mood best are the animals (there lovely)
50,We always have a great time at the Mirage. Clean friendly and easy to get around. We try to go at least three times a year. It is also close to other great casinos and easy to walk the strip. Fun place to go
50,Beautiful hotel. Amazing show a must see Shin Lim. A free volcano show provided by Mirage. Really good breakfast. Overall a very good vacation. Location is great . Friendly staff. Must visit the hotel even if you decide not to stay there.
50,I have been staying at the Mirage on every trip for over 20 years and it never disappoints. The pool is phenomenal and the overall vibe in the casino is great. High quality restaurants and service. It is a travesty that this casino has been sold. Great volcano show great location. It will be sorely missed.
10,The main line backedup and I woke up to my room having two inches of poop water all the way up from the bathroom to the window. So the entire floor was covered. Your toliet and bathtub was full of poop water and other things. The pipeline even spit out syringes... the worst experience of my life. Truly traumatizing. My first time in vegas was ruined along with 90% of my cloths and shoes and also my luggage being destroyed by the filt water. The best trip turned into the worst trip due to your hotel
20,The room was pretty gross and over priced. We didn’t complain it’s old and didn’t seem worth it. There was a chair in our room that had a variety of crusted substances on it. I have no desire to know what those were.
40,Everything was good aside from parking not being covered; and some idiot didn't check the size of the hangers to see if they'd to on the pole... messing I couldn't hang up my clothes.. otherwise it was fun
50,I enjoyed my stay here very much. I stayed almost a week and was very comfortable. I was there for a work convention but also solo. When I needed help or had a question the staff was very nice. I felt very safe there as well for a busy place and everything felt better organized than other hotels I’ve stayed at there.
40,Had a great stay great room good food nice shows. Staff wanted you to enjoy yourself and provided any assistance necessary. Had fun at the sportsbook and slots very newer and played nice. I'll be back!
40,Easy walk to Caesar's Venetian Harrah's and the Link  Beatle's Love a must see. Rooms could use updating but comfortable. Staff very friendly and helpful. Uber not miles away like in some hotels. Could use more food choices
50,Good food variety. Good ice cream shop. Clean rooms. Great location on strip. Great service in casino area. Good shopping stores available in casino. Customer service at hotel and members desk was great experience
50,It's my 3rd or 4th time at the Mirage. It's a great location impeccably clean. The slots paid out okay and all the food I tried was good. We went to the Secret Garden again and enjoyed the dolphins. We got a GREAT price on our room through M Life. My only problem is our view had the Trump Tower smack in the middle of it. I think if I had asked they would have moved me but it wasn't important enough for me to make the effort.    That aside great hotel and we will miss it when Hard Rock takes over.
50,We enjoy the atmosphere and detail this property has to offer. It’s close to many restaurants and other hotels to walk around and enjoy all that the strip has to offer. The Starbucks here is a must for early mornings!
10,We can get much updated rooms for the price you pay for an outdated room/amenities in the room. No shuttle service from/to Las vegas airport. No coffee machine in the room as well. Phone plug in the wall was all the way back to the floor behind the side table of the bed. we barely found it.
50,Well kept excellent dining and gaming selection fantastic location. MGM App makes everything a breeze. Free parking for Pearl tier rewards members. The pool area is extremely large and tropical feeling!
30,No coffee pots or a frig our room had zero space in bathroom infact the old nasty blow dryer was in the closet with 1 extra roll of toilet paper and no frig . Not sure I would stay at this location again ! Lots colkege kids on our floor too
40,my son and I traveled to Vegas for The NHL All Star game. We stayed on the top floor in a penthouse suite The room was stellar! My son thought he was pretty big deal having a VIP room card and his own elevator.
50,Came to Las Vegas for college basketball and the Mirage was an excellent choice for us. It’s got a great location on the strip good restaurants on site and an easy electronic check in/out process. The room was nice clean and had a partial view of the pool and strip.
40,Enjoyed the casino room and steak restaurant. The Mexican restaurant was not as good but the strip steak was super. We had breakfast one day at the restaurant but wished it had opened sooner. We crossed the street to McDonald’s on two occasions.
50,We had a great stay! This is a great property and we will be sad to see it go. Everyone was great especially the front desk staff. Very friendly and they did everything they could to make us feel welcome and take care of us.
50,Great for a quick stay excellent location. Still a nice property and the pool is one of the best when open. I'm nitpicking but the only negatives may be the mini fridge system. It only opens if you buy something. And there is no coffee maker in room. But the Staywell King room was comfortable and quiet.
10,The room was nice but not satisfied with all the extra fees! There is parking fees resort fees and even a fee to use the fridge which is ridiculous! The resort fee should cover this and not try to nickel and dime your customers
50,My first time at the Mirage and it was such a great experience overall. Extremely nice staff employees and the facilities (meeting areas etc.) were perfect. I attended the WPPI convention for the first time. Looking forward to next year!
40,Great location mid strip!  Nice clean rooms.  Hallway is a little noisy ( the doors seems to close loudly)  The “ snacks” restaurant has amazing burgers and deserts  We saw Shin Lim show… very good! I highly recommend!
40,We had a great time as usual staying at the Mirage is always a great experience!! It's so easy to get out on the strip for walking and taking in all the sights or dinning out at one of the many super good choices around the area.
40,Who doesn’t love Vegas Vacation  This iconic hotel is beautiful inside and out. To bad the tigers aren’t on display like they used to be. You can still see them it just requires admission. Clean friendly
40,I liked staying at the Mirage it's clean it doesn't smell like cigarettes. Some Restaurants are pricey. The location is great.  The only thing the water and snacks are expensive they charge 18.00 for a bottle water. Had to go CVS get snacks. Had fun gambling also its sad to see the The Mirage is going down Hard Rock Casino is coming its place.
50,Excellent stay at the Mirage. Rooms were very clean.  Staff was friendly and helpful. Shows and shops and plenty of places to eat in the casino.  My favorite place to eat is The Pantry. You never really need to leave the casino.
50,Had a great time as usual. The Mac and cheese at the restaurant was great. Everyone was friendly. The room was clean and so was the casino area. They do need more cocktail waitresses walking around though.
50,Beautiful hotel had an awesome time  Food was great a little pricey for the amount of food you get. Items in the refrigerator is ridiculously expensive go across the street and get your drinks. I will definitely return because I had an awesome time with my husband
50,I love the Mirage. A fun casino with some great restaurants and the location on the strip makes it a great place to stay. Try a tower suite it’s very impressive. Parking is easy and available. I also like the ease of their sports book.
50,Great trip. Pleasant employees throughout the Hotel resort Casino. Many table games and slot to choose from. Safe clean rooms and fun casino area.  Nice short walk to other strip casinos. Don't miss the volcano.
50,Love staying at the Mirage. Rooms are wonderful. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Good choices if restaurants to eat. Casino floor is well managed and slot machines are in working order. Check in and check out is a breeze.
50,Great location on The Strip. Loved the electronic check-in and check-out process... we didn't have to wait in long lines. Comfortable beds and clean rooms that had plenty of room. Would definitely stay at The Mirage again.
50,I love staying at The Mirage. The hotel’s clean the playing atmosphere is great and it’s close to everything. I usually get a pretty good deal through M Life as well so it’s a no-brainer. The restaurants there are great as well
50,Everyone in our group had a great time. The suite was amazing and having the 2nd room nearby was very convenient. Having access to the VIP lounge was great and the food at Heritage Steakhouse was incredible. Thank You.
30,There were parties in rooms at all hours and very loud. It seems to me that the property has been sold and they are going to make as much money as they can until it is taken over. They finally have some Blackjack tables that pay 3-2. But the slots were not paying at all. We had 5 guys and we all agreed that the slots were off.
50,Wonderful service after having a difficult 24 hours getting out of Connecticut in a snowstorm. Very accommodating And helping us reschedule things a day later. Rescheduled Beatles love for us Which was a fantastic show. Amazing Dinner and stellar service at Heritage and Costa.
40,It was my first time staying there before it gets remolded completely to the new resort. The room was nice and clean hallways/elevators. The ambience in one of the bars in the casino had good music on the weekend
40,Stayed at the mirage this past weekend for anniversary. Check in host was great. Very friendly. Room was nice except for some used women’s eyelashes stuck to the floor and quite a bit of dirt built up by window and under nightstand. Other then that the bed was comfy bathroom clean and decent view. Like that the Mirage is centrally located on the strip. Very easy walk to other casinos and restaurants. My only other real concern was how thin the doors were to the room. You literally hear every conversation in the hallways and can hear other people in their rooms. Especially if it’s a loud party group. Other then that all good experience.
30,We stayed at the Mirage for a couples get away. Hotel is great for location and nice options inside for eating etc. front desk needs some work with friendly staff. Rooms were dated and for the price expected more of a hotel rates 8.2 or higher.
50,I had an amazing trip for my cousin wedding celebration this pass weekend. The service was amazing and the workers showed through good customer service that they love there Jobs. The rooms where spotless. And casino and food in walking distance.
20,I paid for the late check out. Went to the pool and was locked out of my floor. (Returned to my room after regular check out time) Tried to take the stairs and was trapped in stairwell for 15 minutes.
50,Best all-around property there is. We stayed at the Villa which is impossible to beat. Pool is one of the best on the strip. Otoro is delicious. Shin Lim might be the best show in town. Volcano atrium pedestrian entrance. Location makes it walkable to Wynn Caesars Bellagio. Also smells good and feels safe.
40,This property is beautiful. The pool area was relaxing. The food choices were plentiful. The staff was friendly.It was perfect for my anniversary and birthday celebration. My only complaint is the rooms were a little outdated.
30,Our shower control was loose and would not stay at a constant temperature one of the 2 outlets wasn’t working to charge our phones the sheets on the bed needed to be changed by US! and the shower could have been cleaner.  Front Staff is wonderful and hotel is very clean. The rest should be up to the same standard but it’s lacking.
50,What a Great hotel. So much fun in the casino awesome bar area for networking great drinks. Big Clean rooms with comfortable beds quiet great shower head!! Fantastic and friendly staff great restaurants as well!
50,The Mirage is right in the heart of Vegas. There are several options for dining and entertainment. The hotel is beautiful and we enjoyed the volcano and dolphins. We ate dinner at the Still Crafts and breakfast at the Pantry.
40,The Mirage is the home of the WPPI convention. The hotel is comfortable and clean it has a good selection of eateries and a great gelato place. It seats right in the middle of the Las Vegas strip which makes it close to the hot spots. I’ll be back next year.
30,I travel quite often. This is my last visit to this hotel. I was here for a convention. The staff are absolutely wonderful from the front desk to the maids greeting you To every restaurant within; their personnel. I paid for a strip view room. The view was fabulous of the city lights. The room quite large and comfortable. For some reason the shears in my window were all shredded. But the base room price was very reasonable under $200. Where are my issue lies is following: upon check-in I expect full payment to be charged to my credit card but an added $400 for “ anticipated extra incidentals“ was a shock for me. I can overlook that since I know I am not going to steal anything. The hotel thinks of itself as a four-star hotel. There is no coffee maker there is no microwave and a very large refrigerator is not for personal use. Period. I attempted to remove items from fridge to make room for restaurant leftovers. That is a no-no. I was told normally a consumer is charged $50 a day to use the refrigerator for storage. Obviously that would include the many bottles of water that I always purchase when in Las Vegas. There is a sensor that tells the hotel every time you remove something. Obviously I put every single item back and after chatting with the front desk upon checkout they believed me that I did not consume any of the provided items from the mini bar nor the snack bar from the counter top. The mandatory resort fee of $39+ daily no longer includes bottled water. Resort fee includes use of workout room (which I never use) wi-Fi (which I have no use for since my phone has unlimited) etc. I used to appreciate the provided daily bottled water in said resort fee. I did enjoy my business stay. However there are absolutely no fringe benefits to staying at this hotel for me. I have no plans to be back to overprices of Las Vegas.
50,My wife and I love this hotel and casino. Great facilities and even better staff. The staff is second to none and work very hard to fulfill all requests. Planning our next stay already for September. It’s a shame that Hard Rock will be replacing it. The Mirage is an institution on the strip and should never go way.
50,The Room:  It was comfortable in size for me and my wife. The view was amazing. We could see the strip and the mountains. We overlooked the secret garden and the pool.  Food:  The first place we tired was Snack. We were jet lagged off the plane and ate here around 2am. The food was good but it was our first experience with The Strip pricing.  The Sill- We only got apps here but they were very good. Beer was cold. The food coming out looked delicious.  Stack- One of the best meals of my life. We were seated in the rear of the beautiful restaurant which made us feel like we weren't in a casino. We got the steak and lobster for 2. It was the most tender steak I've had. The lobster came with a ritz cracker based spread that was incredible.  Entertainment:  Love- We had never seen a cirque du soleil before but the concierge Glen recommended it should be something we should see and hooked us up with fantastic seats. The show was incredible and we would go see it many more times.  Overall it was an amazing experience here. We thought it was going to be a once in a lifetime but we are already planning on coming back.
30,Compared to other casinos in the area The Mirage offers lots of dated machine with limited variety. The clientele has become more of a young club-oriented time. The restaurant choices are also limited especially for breakfast.
50,Went for my Birthday! The whole experience from the Staff being so friendly to the Excellent Food. This was my 3rd stay at the Mirage! Definitely repeat customer here. Already booked another trip for June. I’ve yet to experience any negative or less the satisfactory there yet!
50,Staff was great the hotel was clean. The only thing that would have been better would have been an actual refrigerator in the room so we didn’t have to mess with coolers. Great location within walking distance to other great hotels.
30,Unfortunately definitely not what it used to be! Also not up to usual MGM standards.    Pros:  Location  Cheap  Heritage Steak    Cons:  Hotel floors smell of marijuana  Rundown  Bathrooms outdated  Lacking amenities of other newer hotels    I know it’s leaving so visit for nostalgic reasons only.
50,We had a great time visiting Las Vegas. The hotel staff were very accommodating to my party of 11 (5 rooms). With The Mirage in a central location we were able to walk to the surrounding hotels/casinos.
50,Great location right on the strip but in the middle. Great value on shows and service was excellent. Good was great. A great veridity of different games. Room was super clean. Would recommend everytime.
20,This is one of the worst “Las Vegas” so called “resort” hotels! First of all it is of a resort at all! It’s called that so they can tack on a resort fee ($30/day) to make the rooms look less expensive. Yes you can get wifi (big deal! - not!) and access to a ‘work out room’ but you have to pay even more money (+$30) to use the spa’s steam room and sauna! Really?    You have to wait in a SLOWLY moving line to check in unless you do so in advance via your email confirmation. The lobby and casino are connected and the entire area including most of the restaurants are filled with disgusting cigarette smoke! It’s crowded so forget about social distances. The restaurants are mediocre except for OTORO a Japanese Robata style restaurant which was really good.    Fortunately the conference center is well laid out and clean; free of cigarette smoke.    The standard rooms are not much better than those found in cheap hotels with bathrooms that have old ceramic tiles and grout that looks and likely is dirty. The rooms and baths are poorly lighted with old carpeting and old bathroom fixtures! The maid forgot to resupply shampoo and soap one day and doubled up on it the following day when I complained (I didn’t need the extra soap and shampoo)!    The hotel needs to be demolished and rebuilt!
50,Conveniently located by all the major resorts and casinos with clean rooms plenty of restaurants short walk to convention hall and short walk to all the sights on the strip. Check in was easy and contactless through the app.
30,Don’t honor Expedia rapid rewards membership. Shower heads weee very moldy. AC only turns on if your in the room. Our mini fridge did not open it was locked after calling front desk no one answered. Bad customer service
10,"It it a good thing this hotel is going to be overhauled our room was stinky even though we paid extra for the ""STAY WELL"" option. Not a single request i had for the front desk was taken care of. Terrible experience. I have to go back there again next year for work conference and will be staying somewhere else and walk"
50,My fav hotel on the strip! I’m hoping to come back before it becomes a giant guitar! Im so happy CPK is back ! Everything was so comfortable! The new gelato place was great! Always fun to visit the spa!
50,The pantry restaurant was amazing! We are there twice! Great food and great service! The aquarium was also nice I missed the volcano but the resort location was perfect! I would definitely stay here again!
50,We always feel welcome at the Mirage. We like the hotel and the service. We love our comps. We love our casino host the bartenders and the choices of places to eat. Very nice choice of places to stay and close to a lot of other things.
40,i booked to stay at the Mirage Hotel and was assigned a King Volcano View Room. When i arrived a bit of shock and awe at this property with the palm trees and tropical theme and ambience it gives off at night as my cab pulled up to the main entrance. Walked and the front desk is off to your right check in staff polite and friendly advised me how to get to the guest elevators to my room. Entered my room and it was a standard king sized room it was clean bed was comfortable. While my stay at the hotel i checked out several bars eateries inside the hotel with friends i met up with. Room Rate was reasonably priced for the property. I had no issue or complaints as it was a very memorable trip and enjoyable stay at the Mirage.  Thank you for your hospitality.
50,"We have stayed at the Mirage for years and always enjoy it. Staff is great and helpful and while it is now one of the ""older"" hotels we still love the ambiance -- easy to get around easy to find everything etc."
10,Blocked tub drain with water up to my ankles in two different rooms!! Old dated decor and carpeting was stained and crusty feeling. Bring slippers! I booked because I was offered a stay 2 nights get 3rd night free. I got no free night and was told by the front desk that they couldn’t help me.
40,Great location. Great pool area but closed at 4pm. Adequate restaurant selection. Very comfortable bed and bedding. Would have liked a view but room was easily accessible. Lots of slots to choose from.
40,Excellent atmosphere great staff. My room was good easy to sleep in. Tram was OOS and the buffet closed too early like 3pm?! Don’t quite understand why they let ‘players’ SLEEP in the casino - kinda annoying. Yeah I know they weren’t players..
50,I was there 36 years when it opened and it is still going strong. Good service clean rooms and great service. The restaurant has breakfast all day and the chicken fried steak is delicious. I wish I had time to see the Cirque de Soleil show with the Beatles.
30,some things broken in rooms. lil mirror. carpet lil dirty... no hotel really is tho. oh well. WPPI attendees ..Rooms smell a lil must when entering... Semi pro Photographers learning. We love the bars/rest's. Food was great. Quite expensive. that was expected.
50,Checked in on the app. Everything went very smooth. View was nice from the room. Casino is large with plenty of slots. Lots of different restaurants to choose from. Room service was fast as getting everything clean.
40,I love the mirage. it is my favorite hotel in Las Vegas. The location pool and staff are incredible. They always go above and beyond. The only reason that this is not a 5 star review is because I was charged an upgrade fee without being made aware of it. I find this practice to be highly deceptive and unfair to the consumer. Aside from that everything else was phenomenal keep up the good work and please #savethevolcano
40,3 nights at the Mirage were great saw The Beatles Love (It was fantastic - a big WOW from everyone.) Saw America's Got Talent at the Luxor also very entertaining. Only gripes: digital key didn't work (so much for checking in on the phone had to go stand in line to get a card key anyway. A warning for 1st timers - don't touch the mini fridge. Sensors automatically charge you for anything you touch. For example: take a look at a Fiji water bottle and put it back...cha-ching! You just added a charge of 18 bucks to your bill!
50,This casino is just the right size for small conventions. The convention center is well-located so it is not too far to walk but it is roomy and has excellent staff to accommodate the crowds. The rooms are great the casino is clean and the food is fabulous!
10,First off we requested for a room with a nice view since my wife and I wanted to enjoy a weekend away from the kids. We ended up getting a room on the 4th floor with a view of the roof on the neighboring hotel tower which was very disappointing.    In addition the bed had one flat sheet and what apparently was a comforter which was just slightly thicker than the flat sheet which was just terrible. Moving on to the bathroom the exhaust fan was extremely noisy toilet paper was thin and terrible door barely clears the toilet when you open it water temperature/pressure was also terrible.    Moving on to the Lobby we sat down and play slot machines and few different tables and within the 2-hours of playing not one waitress approached us offering a drink after spending/winning money.    We decided to check out other hotels/casinos to gamble a received drinks in a timely fashion.    In conclusion I’m not sure if this is all happening since this hotel was recently purchased by the Hard Rock Hotel but we will never be returning to the Mirage Las Vegas and no plans on staying at another MGM owned property since our previous experience at the Park MGM was very similar.
40,During check-in the desk person must of not hit the correct key cause the email said I would receive $50 in Food and $50 Play Credit which I couldn’t access during my stay. The Check-out person did lower my Resort Tax charge by using the $50 in unused Food credit but what happened to the $50 Free-Play credits. Just got Hosed on the Freebies.
50,I was very pleased with the room location off hotel is great staff was polite and friendly. The only thing i did not like they don't have a poker room. But places close had them just a short walk. Plenty of slot machines and table games
50,Celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary. Stayed at the Mirage during our wedding. As seniors we were not too happy to have the last room down a long hall from the elevator. Overall we love the Mirage.
50,Wonderful family getaway. Great family entertainment besides the casino. The Cirque De Soleil Beatles show is I think the best show in Las Vegas--definitely a MUST see. Nice selection of restuarants also.
30,Well they just need to pay attention to maintenance here the sinks all were slow drain big crack in the window in our room on the 25th floor very low water pressure impossible to get shampoo out of hair. All the restaurants were way over priced for what was served.
50,People are all excellent rooms nice and very clean other bathroom could use a maintenance person and some updating. Casinos in MGM are falling behind Caesar’s with updated Games craps for one. The computerized glass crap tables are awesome.
30,The Mirage was just ok. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the room was nice and clean and the bed was comfortable it just needed maintenance. Peeling paint dirty carpets the bathroom door would not latch the sink was clogged. Nothing big just inconvenient and not up to par.
10,They overbooked rooms I paid much for mine back in November put me in standard room that was horrible and made me feel I was ungrateful. Shocked and extremely disappointed! They put the work back on the guest instead of actually making it right!
20,Truck won’t start for 3 days in garage. Security and concierge no help. Wouldn’t even let repair man leave his truck for awhile while he came up. You need to have a service to call at the least. Guy we called stalled us for 3 days.
50,Stayed in the tower Suite 2 bedrooms had an amazing time and the concierge service was excellent highly recommend this especially for a birthday party or any celebration.  Amanuel went over the top for our group and was one of the absolute highlights of our trip.
30,I guess because I booked through a third party my app wouldn't work. I didn't get any perks at all l including the $50 per day food and drink allowance that was advertised online. When I tried to find out why none of the staff seemed to care. The window in the room leaked air from the wind so I had to set the thermostat at 75 to feel warm.
30,The room elevators are far from the main entrance so it's a ton of walking just to get to the room. Refrigerators in the room are filled with overpriced snacks that are charged by weight so you can't empty the Refrigerator and put your own stuff in it. There are no coffee makers in the room or microwaves. So you have to spend $5 a cup downstairs at a Cafe instead. A large bottle of water from the store downstairs by the elevator was $7.50 a bottle. Restaurants located inside the resort were very expensive $20 breakfast entrees - we went to Dennys across the street and got more good for a better price.  The rooms were not the cleanest but acceptable. The room windows do open for fresh air regardless of what floor you are on. Walls in the room are paper-thin and ypu can hear when the toilet flushes or someone showers next door. A decent hotel but definitely not luxury. Staff were very friendly and elevators were split for different floors so there was not much a wait.
40,Travel to the hotel was easy and fun. Overall service from bathrooms to conference rooms to bed room was fantastic. Food lines moved quickly for the most part and gaming was okay but should be a little looser next time LOL!
50,Friendly staff excellent service fantastic location. From check in to grabbing food the staff at the mirage are great! The casino staff are engaging and make gambling more fun. I would 100% recommended staying here.
30,I expected nicer accommodations for almost $400/night. I could’ve stayed at a much nicer hotel for that price. Constant maintenance or repairs going on in the room next door which was loud because of a drill and hammer being used. Bathroom was below standards.
10,Food was undercooked. Shower head was way too short. Credit was not applied. Mini bar prices $18 for a water and $9 for Pringles is pure insanity. No one goes to vegas expecting to spend money infact I love spending there but I don’t like to feel like I got taken advantage of. I usually don’t complain but Everything that happened made it worse
50,If your loooking for a one stop hotel this is your place. Restaurants Starbucks bars casino and shows…there is literally no reason to leave the resort!!! I would absolutely recommend a stay here!!
50,"Great room  Stayed in wellness suite .  Enjoyed 3 restaurants in Mirage All excellent. Location is perfect .Central on strip.The show :"" Beatles Love ""was well worth it My 4th time seeing it. Unfortunately to chilly for pool."
50,Pre-Anniversary Trip! Had a great time. Had an opportunity to take in a great comedy show as well as visit Fremont Street again. Pampas is a regular stop as well a Hash House!!! Always a pleasure to visit!
40,Hotel rooms are a bit dated for the price but housekeeping kept it very clean. Hotel staff were awesome. They're friendly professional and knowledgeable. The lobby area is beautiful. Shopping at the hotel was decent.
40,Great hotel good location  staff was fantastic. Food very good. Pool was very nice. Main pool was closed as it was off season but small pool was open. Room was nice. Nothingn spectacular but clean and wel maintained. Overall great experience.
50,Rooms were nice and comfy. Good wifi. It is a good location to visiting restaurants nearby as well. We enjoyed walling around the stores in the Mirage as well the connecting casinos. Took the tram too.
50,I liked the size and cleanliness of the room. The online check in with Virtual key made it very convenient plus the staff were very helpful and friendly. I also like the location of this Hotel very easy to go around. I was by myself for pleasure and business at the same time and the Hotel made my stay complete.
50,WE LOVE LOVE LOVE THE MIRAGE. We spent 3 nights there in February 2022. The Mirage is a spectacular property. The location on The Strip is perfect. I cannot descibe the pool to justifiy just how wonderful it is. So relaxing the tropical theme makes you feel like you are on an island. The volcono attraction is still as amazing as the first day it opened. They need to keep that and the pool. Hotel room was great nice size room and very very clean. Had a great Strip view.  Casino floor is fun. Loads of machines and very generous cocktail service. Staff are wonderful from check-in to floor staff all very friendly and helpful.  We can't wait to go back. Highly remommend a stay at The Mirage.
50,I visit The Mirage several times a year! This is the ONLY place to stay on the strip! It is fun safe and has a great location! The restaurants are great the rooms are very clean and comfortable and the slots are the loosest on the strip! A big plus is you can enjoy a first class show without leaving the resort! Unfortunately I hear they sold it and the Hard Rock Cafe bought it. How sad! The Mirage is an icon and the erupting volcano is historic! PLEASE call off the deal Mirage!
50,Great place to stay. Fun and lots of places to eat. Staff all friendly and accommodating. Our time there was short. But we will be back asap! Also great place to stay to be in the middle of the strip and get to see and do a lot of fun things.
50,Excellent service! Clean and inviting! Casino games and dealers were awesome and supportive. Can’t ask for more. Restaurants were a bit questionable on how to gain access by reservations only you would have to know where you want go before your trip.
50,The Mirage is awesome. Homey friendly and helpful. Host willie is the best. Ms. Dianna at the mlife desk is wonderful. Everyone treats you like family. The Pantry is the best. Love this place.
50,I was there for the super bowl It was a great time the room was fine I was supposed to be looking out over the main strip and I wasn’t that’s the only complaint I would have outside of that everything was fine with the casino in my room
50,Remodeled volcano view room was great! Check in was easy and friendly even though I used the mobile check in desk. The gentleman that was there to assist was kind and professional. I felt welcomed and at ease with the process.
50,Great hotel friendly staff good view from the room. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that's going to Vegas. It's center pf the strip and a great location to get anywhere you need to go.
50,Very professional friendly staff found everywhere at the Mirage. Lovely clean and spacious room. We like the smaller size of this resort as everything was very accessible in a quick time. Location is great - convenient to shopping. Went to see Live and it was terrific!
50,The Mirage looks feels and even smells like a resort. It is a destination removed from the world. it is a great escape. Yet it is accessible proximate to so much and offers great service value and hospitality.
40,Great location on in the middle of the Strip. Hotel nice size not too big and was easy to find everything. Great rooms especially as mine was free through MGM Rewards. Good food in the Mexican Restaurant there called El Diablo.
30,My booking was screwed up therefore not allowing me to use my vegas rewards free play. I paid for two night in one stay. However it was booked as two seperate periods for the entire length of my stay. I expalined it to the manager and she pretty much told me there was nothing she could do about how it was booked. I find it hard to believe that my reservation could not have been fixed to show 1 booking for my entire stay rather than two bookings; thereby preventing me from have two paid nights on one booking so I could have used my vegas rewards.
50,The hotel was clean and they accommodate me the suites. And I look forward to returning soon. The only thing I wish on this trip was the Mlife program had been updated and therefore the system changed as well.
50,We like the ambiance. The variety of restaurants for breakfast lunch or dinner. The reception desk personnel are very pleasant. It is easy to visit other establishments from the Mirage. Security is great and their are no distractions in the corridors for those who want to get some sleep.
50,Our first time staying at a MGM property. It was amazing. Clean room .. comfy beds . Servers on the floor was fantastic  bring me and my husband 2 drinks at a time ! Definitely recommend! Easy check on .. all on your phone . Plus the keys was Bluetooth .
50,The location of the Mirage is ideal. It is close to other hotels/casinos we wanted to visit for activities. Also central to visiting other close restaurants. There is a Walgreens across the street for sundries.  The facilities and outlets in the Mirage are wonderful as well: The Roasted Bean; The Pantry; Costas; Cocolini.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The staff is friendly.  The casino had a certain energy.
40,Stayed for 13.1 run. Room had no coffee  or fridge. You basically get soap unless you want to pay 10 bucks for a warm water . The water is in the room. The beds were excellent. A little noise but it’s Vegas
50,The staff was really friendly and the rooms were really clean It was one of the best times that we ever had in Vegas We and we are planning on going back in June I hope when we go back the pools will be open
40,Excellent hospitality staff and the rooms were very clean. Every morning while leaving the room we were greeted and told to have a great day. Really made you feel welcome. We will stay with the folks at the Mirage again.
50,The hotel was very clean and staff very helpful and friendly. Plenty of places to eat California Pizza Kitchen was delicious staff was friendly and efficient. Rooms were spacious and bed was extremely comfortable. Would definitely stay there again.
50,I enjoyed the whole experience!! The hotel was gorgeous and the staff was wonderful. Very convenient location which was perfect for me. This will not be my last stay at this hotel!! Loved it all! GO!!
30,I had always wanted to stay at the Mirage. The casino is bright with lots of flowers and water features but my room here was just ok bit outdated. And the fact that there was no late night food on a Friday night was very strange.
30,I think they are basics every hotel should have and I get those even in the cheapest hotels that Mirage in Vegas didn’t have.  There was no coffee machine in the room if you want to watch a movie you have to pay! And the pillows are cheap pillows instead of good feather pillows. I was looking for extra blanket nope 🤷‍♀️
20,First of all I love Las Vegas; my first experience was amazing. However I stayed at the MGM grand the first trip. This trip wasn’t as good. The fun was still there but the room was unacceptable. The room was not what we paid for at all. The compensation for the complaints was unsatisfactory.
40,The Mirage is still a Great Hotel! Good prices food gaming and entertainment. The rooms were clean the queen beds were very comfortable. The only gambling we couldnt find was traditional poker. The sports book area is very nice! The gambling offers affordable and high end options. There are plenty of food options available. We ate in the hotel for almost every meal due to the options. I will definitely stay there again!
20,"We stayed at the Mirage for one night in early February 2022 to see the Beatles Love show which plays there. Made and ""paid"" reservation online for the room.    Just got my credit card statement - beware the ""resort fee"". It added 50% to the room rate I reserved. Called the hotel. Too bad for me!"
50,Loved the Mirage and will definitely be back. 2nd trip we took in 2 week span and after staying at the Signature the first trip we wished we had chose the Mirage for both of our trips. Definitely our choice of stay for every time we go back.
20,While service was decent and the room was clean the overall feel of the hotel is that it's getting run down. The rooms felt old cheap linens nothing that felt 'above average'. At best - this should be a cheaper option on the strip - which it is. Don't think you're getting a great deal if you're paying less... you get what you pay for... and that's ok too.
50,I like the way staff treat t you bar's alway friendless check inn was fast and easy as an MGM LIFE member we get free parking los and points the location is just perfect because you walk out of the casino and is close to almost everything i have fun
50,I am pleased with the mirage. I’m not pleased with this trip advisor page. This is the third time I have written this. That should tell you how much I like this hotel. The front desk staff and concierge were excellent. I wish I could live here.
30,Rooms are clean and quiet but dated. I felt the resort fee of $35/night was excessive for the property. Restaurants were decent. Nice location. My biggest problem is the casino was exceptionally smoky. I add a pounding headache from the second hand smoke by the end of the night. I only stayed at the Mirage for its location to my special event I was attending.
40,Great place to stay not the most luxurious but still very nice. Easy to access other parts of the strip. Got a pedicure at the spa which was very enjoyable! The casino area was kept very clean. Sad that restaurants are not open 24/7 like they used to be.
10,Stayed at the mirage for the half marathon our room had a leaking bathtub horrible view even after asking for a nice view we were told they could accommodate and we were placed on the 4th floor with the air conditioner view. The shower had no hot water regardless of the time of trying to shower and even with gambling in the casino for hours we were never offered a drink or saw a waitress. The Starbucks and CPK was the only good part of our stay.
40,We had a great trip at the Mirage. I would definitely consider going again and would recommend for others. I do wish there were fridges microwaves and coffee makers in the room. I also wish the pools were open later than 4:00.
20,We tried to elevate our experience this trip by staying in the penthouse suite. What a waste. The room was a mess and had trash dust and fingerprints everywhere. The lampshades were dusty and crooked and the mini fridge ice maker had many black specks in the ice it created. It couldn't even keep the ice cold enough for it to keep its shape so overnight the ice slowly melted and refroze to create a 4 inch thick black specked ice block. The furniture in our room was extremely poorly maintened. Scratches nicks dust you name it. The TV in the main living room didn't work and we had to call maintence twice to resolve the issue. The TV in the master bedroom had so much dust in the speakers I was surprised we could hear anything. Also the TV doesn't automatically go up and down. If you want it to go down you have to call maintenence and someone has to come and manually lower the TV into the cabinet. The walk down the hallway is not much better with an abundance of peeling wallpaper and dark dingy lighting. I was incredibly underwhelmed with this experience especially for what we paid.
50,I enjoyed my stay at mirage  me and my wife we’re treated with the best room service . The front desk helped us with several moments. The stay in our room was with great conditions we rested we had fun thank you for a wonderful time
40,Toilet was filthy upon check in. Everything was way overpriced . Light in bathroom did not work. Contacted housekeeping on both the dirty toilet and light not working. Toilet was addressed but nothing on the light
50,The Mirage was absolutely incredible. The service they provided really makes you feel like your stay is special to them as well. All the staff at the tables were also extremely thoughtful. I’m an avid craps player - and I must say their patience with my strategy was great.
40,Overall service was good and the rooms were clean. Our room was fine it was clean and everything was in good working order. Unfortunately the room was showing it’s age. Not complaining since it was well worth the price.
50,We have stayed at many of the MGM resorts. The Mirage is definitely one of the top three so far. We loved it!! The hospitality in the restaurants is also wonderful as well as the staff at the Mirage. Great location also.
40,The Beatles show was fantastic room had problems and for the rate we paid the value was low room was to have a jetted tub not the case. Asked for a quiet room freight train went by frequently. Fan noise in the room and below the room.
10,Room sheets were not clean. Water pressure turned on and off throughout whole stay. Also no house keeping throughout whole trip. Very disappointed will be looking to go to another MGM hotel. I don’t recommend staying at the mirage.
50,Beautiful resort and location is great. Good restaurants and drinks. Will definitely return with the family and will recommend to friends. Had a wonderful time. The rooms are spacious and clean. Thanks.
30,It just seemed average in every way. The room was clean and we faced the strip and the volcano but The Mirage just didn't have a whole lot to offer us and once we ventured to the other hotels we found more we enjoyed. We saw Mystere at TI (we weren't interested in Love) and when we were there we found we liked TI's casino a lot better than Mirage's (way less crowded easier to navigate and won more on slots). The food at The Mirage was hard to come by at the times we wanted to eat unless you want pizza. There isn't a large cafe or restaurant for breakfast so you are stuck waiting for 45 minutes for a table at Pantry. We gave up and walked across the street to the Venetian to eat at Grand Lux sat right down and had a wonderful cheaper meal in less time than we would have waited at Mirage. We did that 2 more days in a row because of how good it was. Mirage did have Snacks which had a great burger and desserts but a tiny diner stuck in the corner didn't do much for ambiance. There are no coffee pots in the room at the Mirage and Starbucks in the hotel doesn't open until 6:00am (which doesn't seem like a big deal but coming from central time we wanted coffee early)... Again Mirage is fine... but since Hard Rock has bought it I expect the current guest experience will continue to go downhill until the rebuild starts.
50,The food was amazing the portion size of the sandwiches at Snacks was worth the price of the sandwich. The Secret Garden show was surprising. We were so close to the beautiful talented Dolphins. The slots were fun to play and the bonuses on the machines were fun!!
50,Was a good stat but wish there was a robe available to use. The resort is massive and lots of great restaurants to eat at and bars to have a few drinks. Great location as it is in the center of everything
50,One of our favorite places to stay. It’s right on the strip. You can take the monorail to treasure island as well! Staff was very helpful. Room service was good. You walk into a beautiful ginormous green house with tropical vibes . Love coming back here every time !
40,Plenty of great memories for this MGM property. It is a great location mid strip. Sad to see that it will be gone soon but it is time for a change. The restaurants are still not fully operating. There is no buffet. We mostly dined off the property. The drinks are stingy light pours and expensive but that's the way the strip is nowadays. The rooms are dated and in need of upgrade. The entire staff was friendly and helpful throughout our stay.
50,Totally enjoyable. The staff the room and the total atmosphere. Pool is getting worked on right now so keep that in mind. Don't miss the Beatles as it's a spectacular show. A lot of closed restaurants so keep that in mind but even without a food court we get thru
50,For adults and children the Mirage is the exceptional choice when staying in Las Vegas. Fabulous restaurants mesmerizing stage shows fantastic affordable lodging and the best gambling choices around. In the heart of Vegas the Mirage will leave Vegas in your heart.
10,Water damage on wall on back side of bathroom. Not new damage by any means. I do not enjoy sleeping next to possible mold due to lack of repairs. This is a possible health issue and should be addressed by the hotel immediately for the safety of its guests.
50,The Mirage has been our go to location in VEgas since it opened thirty three years ago. It is the best location on the strip. The restaurants Stack especially are very good. The new Mexican restaurant was excellent too.
50,We had a fabulous time at the mirage. The rooms we clean and we had three of them. No issues at all. Casino was great casino staff were friendly. The parlor lounge is fun with the right entertainment. It was our first time staying on the strip in quite some time so we don’t have much to compare to but pricing was great. Quality was great and we had a really great time!
20,Waited in a hour line then we were given a room that had not been cleaned. Went back to the hour line again to get a different room. They gave us a clean room but would no give us any compensation for our time. The rest of the stay was fine
30,Unfortunately the staff are extremely rude and the room is very uncomfortable and dirty end of my checkout i got charge extra 300$ for the fridge but we didn’t even touched it hopefully they will refund it and according to them that happens every time so i guess you guys need to fix your fridge if it happens all the time
30,Water didn’t go true drain and stay in the bathtub until the end of my shower  I only took shower and didn’t even wash my hair if I wash my hair probably it will take for ever to water go to the drain it was to slow.
50,Definitely a great location! Check in and checkout employees were fast and professional! Housekeeping ladies very polite. Very impressed with the modern rooms Definitely recommend it! Next time I need to try the restaurants
50,I love the entrance and all the amenities available. The volcano was awesome as well as the dining on site. I would stay there again just to see the beautiful flowers and have dinner at Snacks and the pantry.
50,Room and beds were clean and comfortable. Was really nice to have the rooms so close to the convention center. Very convenient. I think the snack collection in the shop could be better but the selections they had worked well enough in a pinch. Friendly staff!
50,.irage is central on strip. Room was clean. Check in and out was quite easy. Casino is one of my favorites. Attended Beattles located in Mirage which was amazing. Volcano in front of Mirage was also great to view
30,The staff at the Mirage was pleasant and in many cases stellar. The hotel/resort/casino itself however is in desperate need of upgrade/modernization. The hotel rooms lack most modern amenities such as smart lights multimedia inputs bathroom technology ( no bidet in mirror TV etc) the temperature control is old and inaccurate and lastly the ability to control lights and window treatments from a single console was disappointing. Lastly the casino needs a total revamp. Unlike some of its neighbors on the strip ( Caesars Aria Bellagio etc) the low ceilings always dim lighting and lack of efficient smoke remediation led myself and many others to leave the Mirage casino in favor of neighboring casinos.
50,Such a nice trip again. Everyone from the valet bags check in/out restaurants stores were exceptionally friendly and good at the service they provided. Food was great at all the places I ate. My room was awesome as always. You just can't get any better than that. Oh yeah the machines were great too. I can't wait to come back. I am already planning.
50,So happy to be back at the Mirage after a long Covid break. Best location clean & friendly staff too. There's a variety of different restaurant venues to choose from to please all foodies...great steak house plus Japanese.
30,The resort outside of our room was great. The bathroom smelt like someone vomit in there before we stayed there and it wasn't cleaned beyond changing supplies. We ended up buying our own cleaning supplies and cleaning the bathroom ourselves.
50,Every time I walk into this place I am transported to another world. The Mirage fragrance hits me and I am officially on vacation. I hit the slots the tables and get my free drinks in. The staff is always nice and the hotel is always clean. Thoroughly enjoy this place.
50,If you have ever wanted to meet or swim with a dolphin here is your chance. It is something you will never forget. The staff is amazing. The Mirage is an excellent hotel with friendly staff and service.
50,Our stay was very nice. We bought tickets to Beatles Love. The show was wonderful. The staff were friendly and helpful. Only issue we had was our room was next to elevator and we can hear it as it goes up and down.
50,This was our first time staying at the Mirage. Staff & cleanliness was awesome. Our cocktail waitress was Vikki and she took good care of us and remembered our drinks everyday for the 4 days we spent.
40,Pleasantly surprised. I know Las Vegas well from many mushiness conferences but didn’t know the Mirage at all. Stayed there with my son’s team while in town for a tournament and would again. The dolphins were an unexpected bright spot.
50,Had the best experience in Vegas in years. Hotel was amazing staff was courteous.....just a great visit and will be back soon!!! Will definitely recommend to family and friends and will be planning another group trip as soon as possible.
30,Lobby desk staff was amazing! They helped us get a second room and too the time to get us on the same floor. Very helpful with all our questions and concerns. Housekeeping was absolutely wonderful. We had extra needs and they made several trips to our room for different requests and exceeded our expectations every time. All housekeeping staff said hello and was friendly each encounter.
30,While the rooms are spacious the hotel staff was not friendly or helpful with our room issues. The casino floor was good and Diablo Mexican food can be skipped pantry is ok. The “snack” place for food was the most edible but over priced for sure and parking prices can be pricey
50,The environment was great the staff was cool watch the Super Bowl in Vegas for the 12th year straight. Overall great location on the strip short walk to other casinos in venues which I really liked the food in the hotel is amazing great variety and different choices all over the place.
50,Always have a great experience there staff is friendly. Shows are amazing. Clean atmosphere!! For the price can't beat it. And it doesn't feel crazy busy like other hotels  And the variety of games are good and nice minimums.
50,I always enjoy staying at the Mirage. The rooms are nice the staff is always great and everything is kept clean. One of the more comfortable beds as well. My only knock in the Staying Well room was the bathroom. I wasn’t too impressed with the bathtub.
30,This hotel is one I’ve stayed at for many years. It has however gone a little downhill. I was going for my 50th birthday with some friends and family. I specifically asked for a strip view and it was a horrible view. Yes. Technically you could see the strip from the side - but not worth paying for a strip view. I finally upgraded to a penthouse suite which was still a pretty crappy view. The manager on duty said the nicer one was not available when I was already told it was. But that’s their call and it’s fine. But the penthouse suite was very dated and did not even come with a clock. I had to ask for it. But the location of this hotel is wonderful. No denying that. Hopefully they will be able to put some love back into this hotel and update it so it can stay competitive with the newer hotels coming up.
50,Very clean super nice staff..location was great. Check in was easy. Although the property had limited eating facilities for family. Meals from the Pantry were good..disappointed that it will be turned into Hard Rock more for younger adults..
50,It was our third time staying at the Mirage. We will be back in the fall and plan on staying here again. The restaurants in the hotel are great- no reason to leave the hotel. The smell when you walk in along with the gorgeous flowers also make the trip!
50,I have never stayed at The Mirage in all the times I've been to Vegas. I absolutely loved it. I would definitely love to stay here again in my next future visits. It is one of the prettiest hotels on the strip.
10,"Front desk employees argued with their company's own app about the time for our early check in. Our early check in according to the app was 9 am. The front desk said I was wrong despite not even checking my phone. We were told to wait somewhere and I would get a text when the room was ready. 45 minutes later after no text I looked at the app again read the fine print and confirmed that I did have a GUARANTEED 9 AM CHECK IN. Long story short when I did receive a room the bathtub had a large blood stain on the flat edge of the bathtub. I went downstairs immediately requesting to cancel the reservation and just leave. The man I spoke too stated ""Those things happen when you rush a room."" Please note that I was not the one who ""rushed"" the room and no - there should never be blood left in a hotel room from a former guest. That is unacceptable and how I was supposed to think that it was okay for there to be blood - I don't know.    PLEASE DO NOT PUT YOURSELF THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE MY HUSBAND AND I DID."
40,The location is great since it near the middle of the Vegas. The room is clean and everything works. Inside the casino there are a lot of differ restaurants shops and bars. Plus they got the Three entertainments (the Beattles’ LoveShin Lim’s Limitless and comedy place).
50,Great stay! Requested conjoining rooms and we were on the end of the floor and it was very quiet at night. The casino is super fun and the food options are perfect. Great location too and easy to get around the strip. My only complaint was when you arrive late at night it can take a while to check in.
40,Check-in was friendly and relatively quick.  The room was comfortable and clean.  On our first night there was a dog running down the corridor which disturbed our sleep. After a call to front desk the issue was resolved.  The only downfall would be the main pool area was still closed in February. Parking is $15 a day this should be free or subsidized for hotel guests.  Would stay again.
50,Today was a rough day when we arrive to Mirage Hotel. The concierge was very prompt and polite. The wait at the front desk is rather long but as soon as you get your keys the smiles begin to show. Everything you need is within the hotel no need to leave. The public restroom was clean the gambling space air was fresh in lost areas. You must try out the restaurant next door to California pizza! The food is great rather pricey but you will love it! We will return back in the future.
50,Great stay at The Mirage. Very clean hotel with lots of great options for food and shopping. I was very pleased with my stay and will be back. Casino was also nice with different slots and other options.
40,"We stayed at the Mirage because we were going to a late night comedy show in the hotel. Despite being an ""older hotel"" it was updated and had all the features expected on the Vegas strip. Great bartenders and plenty of places to eat drink gamble. The gym was even open normal hours (unlike other hotels). The Uber driver said it was one of the easiest drop off & pick ups. Centrally located and easy to get anywhere on the strip. Price was right even on Superbowl weekend where the surrounding hotels were 3x the price. Great value & experience."
50,Enjoy our stay enjoy playing slot machine so accessible with restaurant and convenient stores. So many game selections. Clean room and service is great. Don’t smell too much cigarettes smoke. Clean restroom
50,This is our favorite place in Vegas! Love the rooms and the whole complex is awesome! Would and do recommend this place to everyone headed to Vegas! Hope to return again before it turns into the hard rock!
40,Good Location and Friendly Staff. Nice size TV and bathroom had an exhaust fan. The room was spacious and the beds and pillows ere comfortable. The facility is a little antiquated but overall not bad.
50,Love staying at the Mirage. The location is prime on the strip. Check in is always smooth especially via mobile. Rooms are well kept and updated. Restaurants/casinos on site are phenomenal! Can't beat the prices either. This is our go to stay every time we visit Vegas. MGM rewards make it all worth it as well!
20,A once-great hotel now is a crumbling shadow of its former self. The lobby and casino areas are fine (though I wouldn't choose to spend much time here) - the guest rooms are in need of a major upgrade. A couple of major sticking points: rust on tap in bath no outlet or phone charger anywhere near the bed (so had my phone - which doubles as an alarm clock- clear across the room) - a small but significant annoyance.    Room service is quick and the food is just about edible.
40,Great casino my only suggestion is to not place a sports bet in their betMGM area unless you’re a pro. They expect you to know what each bet means even after telling them it’s your first bet ever and need help.
20,We frequent Las Vegas regularly. The Mirage is the least pleasing stay we have had. The steakhouse is not quality food or experience. No in room refrigerator and out of ice in machines. Clogged shower.
40,Had a great time at the Mirage it’s nice and lots of option only thing when you check in and you have been comped a room they put you in the lowest floors and way at the end !! The food options were also great 😊 had an amazing steak at the steak house can’t remember the name 😉. All and all a fabulous experience
50,As much as there are bigger and more upscale hotels in Las Vegas I can’t see myself staying anywhere else but the Mirage. It’s perfectly located on the strip to walk to other places. The property is always well maintained and they have the friendliest staff I’ve ever dealt with.
50,Worth the stay before it becomes hard rock and everything changes. Small pool was open and the bears were $22 for a bucket of 5! Excellent pool side service as well! We uad the same cocktail waitress as we had a year ago and she was just as excellent!
50,Great location and close to all the great places to visit. We had 3 nights and 4 days trip and no complaints at all for staying there. If I go Vegas again would definitely stay in Mirage. Dolphin show was incredible which is in the backyard of Mirage.
40,We absolutely love the Mirage and will be back. But this time wasn't the same as before and it's only because of 1 person. The guy that checked us in said he tried to get us a complementary upgrade and that's awesome. He was unable to get me anything but for his time and trouble I left him $20. It was when I went back a few days later and asked (the same guy) if I could get a late check out and if it could be complementary. He had a very condescending tone when without looking he said they don't do that. Funny they did it last time. He just gave off a rude vibe but when I went to check out the next guy that waited on me was amazing and helped a girl out
40,Stayed 1 night in February 2022. Stated out having to park in the oversize lot because the height of my truck. It is behind the hotel and over 1/4 mile walk to get to hotel entrance. Room was great big and spacious. The bathroom on the other hand was small and outdated. Small tub/shower combo. I'd stay again if by myself but the bathroom won't fly for the wife. She likes the big tubs at other resorts. Also hope you car or truck fits in the garage.
10,The room was horrible and the walls are paper thin. Could hear every single noise from the other room. Shower pressure was dismal and water leaked onto the bathroom floor. Will never stay here again.
50,Everything went smoothly from the start checking in placing my wagers at the sports book to ordering breakfast & being greeted by an extremely friendly staff. And not having to wear a mask made quite a difference
50,Our favorite resort on the strip. Staff is extremely friendly. Plenty of excellent dining available. The Beatles Show was great. The check in was quick and efficient. The room was big and comfortable with a great view. There were many gaming options.
50,This is our third time at the mirage. Twice with the family and once just as a couple. Everyone is very nice. The rooms are very clean. The location is very convenient to everything. The Still is a very good restaurant and fairly reasonable. Also had a great breakfast at The Pantry which also was fairly reasonable.
50,We always enjoy our stay here. Nice part of the strip. Beatles Love is a must-see. Despite the age of the property rooms are still nice and comfortable. Great dining favourite is the Stack restaurant.
50,We had a very nice stay with you and enjoyed the secret garden with the lions and dolphins. We also went to the Beatles Love Show at your hotel enjoyed that very much also. The only bad thing was we had to go out to eat because your restaurants were always booked and to expensive
30,Granddaughters 21st birthday celebration and had i known you had sold casino i would not of stayed at your place as not any updating and in need of it. Rooms carpet were loose and bathrooms were not updated. Not a good example for my granddaughter of what VEGAS is
50,The dealers & staff are great ! Rooms are always clean. The food at most of their restaurants or at least the ones I have tried is great. My favorite is Heritage they have the best lobster spinach dip!
50,Mirage is a great place to stay!! A lot of different restaurants and the location is perfect. The Sportsbook staff are very friendly and not at all stingy with the drink tickets which is always welcome. Always a great time
50,From the minute I arrived to the minute we all left the staff could not have been more gracious helpful nor accommodating. Although I never needed the housekeeping staff they were always friendly and checked on me on every encounter to make sure I was all set. Top-notch staff!
50,First stay and plan to be back. I have been to LV at least 20 or more times and this was the absolute best trip all around. All the hotel personnel were extremely helpful. I was a newbie to blackjack and my dealer made me feel like I was high roller!! The only thing I did have mild trouble with is regulating the temp in the room. Could not get it to cool off at times. But that could also be because i was on FIRE!!!!
50,Last minute getaway to Vegas over Super Bowl weekend. My room was spacious quiet and clean. The food at California Pizza Kitchen was awesome! Mirage has a great selection of slots and the pool and grounds are gorgeous!
50,The hotel is so beautiful inside and out. The rooms are clean and roomy. It is centrally located on the strip and we had a beautiful view of the strip pools and dolphins! The restaurants have amazing food and room service was great from The Pantry!
40,We love the Mirage and have gone there for several years  too bad it’s becoming the Hard Rock and things are gonna change especially the removal of the animals at Secret Garden the location of the Mirage is wonderful.
50,Overall very happy with my stay. Was in a one bedroom Penthouse Suite on the 29th (D) floor. Room was well-appointed and very clean. There were some small details you can tell they are letting run their course rather than replacing (like the pop-up TV at the foot of the master bed). Still functional but not nearly as impressive as the giant TV in the sitting area. Overall though the room was great. Reasonably good view (although the Beatles LOVE advertisement on the windows makes it a little difficult to get good pictures). Room Service was reasonably quick and very delicious. This was my first time staying at The Mirage and while it's doubtful I'll be back before they start replacing the volcano with a big guitar and gut the place I hope to stay again.
40,The Mirage is luxurious value property on the strip will not be part of MGM Resorts soon. The location excellent being next to Treasure Island Caesar's and Venetian all the best stuff are available.
50,I've always loved my stays at Mirage. I've stayed at Mirage more than I have at any other hotel on the Vegas strip over the past 20 years. This particular stay was no different. Everything was perfect. But the two main reasons I stay at Mirage as often as I do are the M-Life reward program and the fact that I love the part of the strip it is located at. So the news that Mirage is being sold to Hard Rock was TERRIBLE news for me. It was sad during this trip knowing it might be the last time I get to stay there depending on how long the change takes. I will definitely not stay on the property once it is not a MGM property any longer. I've always highly recommended Mirage to friends over the years. I love the rooms I love the pool I love the casino and I love the friendly staff! It is very sad and heartbreaking that it is going away!
50,Once again The Mirage delivered on a wonderful experience. Must have been something in the air but slots were paying and the VIP Super Bowl Party was awesome. The staff here is super friendly and the casino is not too big that you get lost. The TV in the room was a little spotty and they should put hair dryers back in the rooms but those are minor inconveniences compared to the overall quality of the casino. Food is always great. Can't wait to come back!
50,I come every year for the Super Bowl. It is so much fun!!! My family loves the Mirage and I wanted to stay before it leaves the MGM Family. Great staff and very nice rooms. Slept good and we enjoyed most of the food choices there. My family had a wonderful time and it didn't hurt I won a little money (not from the Bengals).
40,The Mirage has been a standard go-to for any Vegas trip in recent years. News that it will be gone soon had me nostalgic and during the recently sports-filled weekend I opted to make sure I had one last stay in the Mirage... and it left me feeling great to have stayed there and sad knowing that it may no longer be there when I come back. Great service fun atmosphere clean positive and an overall great time.  Recommended before it's too late.
50,Old but good. Nice affordable table games nice slots. I've stayed here several times it is the best value on the strip rooms are nice and beds are nice. The location on the stop is also good. The Beatles show is excellent
50,We have stayed there 3 times in the past year coming from Boston and recommended to my daughter and family coming in April. The only drawback is only the small pool was open in February and the weather was really warm and pool packed! Location is the best!
30,I usually Stay at Bellagio I don't think the Mirage compares with Bellagio it needs to improve tge restaurant system and there bathrooms should be bigger. The prices of their food and drinks should be cheaper
40,During my stay I had jewelries and then I was trying to put it on the safe but the safe was not working I called the front desk they send a security to get it fixed and the security couldn’t do anything and and after that they said they going to send technician engineering and they never showed up for three days of my stay so I had to keep my jewelries with me the whole time
40,The hotel and rooms were very clean. Service was good. Could have had more food options several were only open minimal hours or only certain days of the week. Location was good in the middle of the strip with easy access to other hotels.
10,The entire hotel/casino is filthy and smells like an ashtray. The air filtration in the rooms is filthy and triggered horrible allergies for me. I smelled like cigarettes as soon as I stepped out of the shower. The walls were dirty and the whole room just felt disgusting. I told three different employees and not one seemed to care! When I told friends they agreed that this is one of the worst and dirtiest hotels in Vegas.
50,Very clean rooms and resort . Location is prefect and close to everything. Staff is friendly and stays on top of things . Casino drink staff can use a little work but overall best resort I have stayed in
10,Our shower made a loud noise every time you turned on hot water. Tubs were cracked and had stains.    Walls are paper thin and we had to complain about our neighbors. Overall don’t waste your money here. Go elsewhere if you want a comfortable stay
40,headed back to the Mirage for my birthday. So sad it's going away. Stayed in a suite when we got married in 2005. I'll admit it's starting to show its age. Old school tub/shower in a tiny bathroom. But you can't beat the friendly service and the intimacy. Good on MGM. I'd read all the BJ tables were 6:5 but not the case. Crap tables with $10 minimum in the AM. So all in all it was a great trip. I guess moving forward we'll be at the Bellagio. Life is good.
20,Our room was not clean - see pictures. I bet the carpets have never ever been cleaned. The Bathroom needs ripping out and replacing - so outdated. Good location on the strip and handy for the Cirque show however
50,The hotel is in a great location .The concierge staff was extremely informative. Don't drink the water in the bottles in the room or eat the snacks. There is a high dollar charge attached to them. The shower made as loud noise it seemed when the hot water was turned up more.
10,The windows are poorly insulated and even from the 17th floor you could hear what seemed like every car driving by. When I chose the volcano view I expected to be able to see something; in reality the volcano is too far away to be interesting at all from the rooms. The bathroom was very small and the door swing space and the person where a persons knees would be if they were on the toilet share the same space. The refrigerator had zero guest space...it was packed with items for sale. More items were for sale on the counter which is inconvenient if you have a child who naturally wants to pick up the pringles.
40,Was a good time. Clean and efficient. Love the volcano. However I was offered free nights and perks via email but they didn't come through when I tried to claim. Tried to call impossible to reach a real person. Regretfully it's becoming Hard Rock. Was my favorite place to stay until this transition. Overall this trip was good though.
50,Friendly staff nice big rooms. The casino was laid out nicely with a good selection of slots and tables. Food was pricey but excellent. Larger portions. Main Pool was closed for season but smaller pool and outside bar was open. Very enjoyable stay.
50,This casino is super clean. I love how fresh it smells as you enter the casino main entrance . Staff is very friendly from the front desk to the waitress working very hard on bringing us drinks at a slot machine.
50,Awesome room great view of the volcano. Great casino machines we won every night. Amazing food options great and friendly staff. Awesome decorations in the hotel. Loved the tigers and dolphins and enjoyed the huge fish tank and water fall in the main entrance.
50,I had a beautiful stay at the Mirage. Everything is pricey but at least it's all under one roof!! Lots of ppl has luck here in my group! If you preplan and stay on budget... you can have a fantastic trip!!
50,Always a clean well kept facility. Smells nice when you enter your room and the gaming floor doesn't smell like smoke as with many other places. Staff are very friendly and seem to genuinely care about guests having a good vacation
50,Check in was so easy make sure you download the mgm app. You can use your phone as your room key as well as parking ticket.  Slots machines were kept clean no trash and majority of the time no empty beer bottles nor abandoned drinks on top of them. There’s a variety of restaurants and the Beverage servers were frequently making their rounds.
50,Best value and location on the strip by far. Clean beautiful and everything you need within a short walk. We mentioned at the front desk that this was our first time in Vegas and they were kind enough to bump up our room to a volcano view at no cost. Im staying here every time i come to vegas from now on.
50,This was an amazing Hotel it was extra clean the staff and housekeeping we're very friendly I honestly would recommend this hotel to my family and friends thank you Mirage family keep doing an awesome job
50,We went to Vegas which was our first time. Experience was great as was George Strait concert. Mirage was very nice clean and staff was friendly. Just did not like the hiding fee of parking. Overall stay was nice
50,In my opinion the Mirage is the nicest MGM property I've stayed at in the last 5 years we go to Vegas 2-4 times a year. The rooms casino public restrooms and elevators are clean and are in good repair. The staff are polite and professional.
40,It was a nice stay. It is a great deal versus the hotel price. Hotel staff were really friendly and hotel room was clean and fairly modernized. There are many attractions inside the facility and also close to the best part of the strip.
50,Very nice stay for a few days. Convenient to bus and walking to other casinos. Staff friendly and courteous. Its a shame the hotel will be taken down. Rooms were clean. Many restaurants. I looked on the website about the pool and said it was closed when we get there at was open
40,The elevators are plentiful and readily available. The pool has plenty of room for quests who want to relax. The location of the mirage is ideal for walking to close by options. The Beatles love presentation is a must see!
50,Rooms were spacious and clean staff was friendly great check in food was amazing definitely recommend the Pantry for breakfast slots were some of the loosest on the strip for us can't wait to come back as long as hard rock doesn't change it.
50,Overall cleanliness was nice. Staff were helpful. Have always dreamed of staying at the Mirage and we found it affordable for us. We loved the location for its ease of access to some of the best parts of the strip.
50,Excellent consistent quality friendly staff nice amenities pretty flowers; they go out of their way for guest satisfaction; they give many complimentary add-ons and make guests feel welcome. Highly recommended.
50,There is nothing like walking the vegas strip at night the sights and sounds also the crazy drunks and over stimulated tourists. The only thing that beats the Las Vegas strip at night is walking out of the din and distraction and into your own personal tropical getaway... well that's the mirage! From the moment you walk in the door and great by the warm humid and pleasantly perfumed air you know you are somewhere special. I go to Vegas for the food and shows and the Mirage will not let you down there either. All of the casual dinning is exceptional and the fine dining takes the cake... or roll (in the case of Otoro) also if you like sushi you have to try Otoro. Go stay at the Mirage it is my personal tropical respite!
50,Hotel was clean staff provided excellent service and the casino was very clean. Beds were comfy and location was great. The rooms were large showers were wonderful and we would definitely come again!!
10,Obviously money not being spent to keep the quality that the Mirage has always been noted for. It has been sold and will be torn down soon and everything was lacking. Room was unclean soaps and towels were in very short supply in the room. View was lousy and Casino is one giant smoking parlor.
40,First time at this porperty  have been to vagas multiple times as a reference . Location is middle strip convenient. Positives: clean housekeeping staff were wonderful parking garage conveniently locatedand the parking fee covers any and all mirage parking needs at mgm properties. Staff overall very nice concierge was very helpful on check out with boarding pass assist. Coffee is available in am a short walk through casino. The room was a stay well room clean  updated. Mattress very comfortable . Negatives are few: restaurent options somewhat limited for property this size main pool was closed. Slots gave me a beating but doubt that is unique to the Mirage LOL! Its overall a very good middle ground property on strip. I'd rank it similar to NYNY overall not at the level of Venetianbut far better then MGM . Enjoy!
50,The Mirage was a great choice for my trip to meet up with my mother sister and brother-in-law. We had wonderful breakfasts at The Pantry SNACKS and with room service. I liked that there were 2 coffee shops. The property was so beautiful when you stepped outside. We loved walking around the Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat. The Beatles LOVE show was absolutly spectacular and I would go again in a heartbeat. The beds were supportive and comfortable so I slept well. The casino had a nice selection of slots though there were some I looked for that I couldn't find. On my last day I played slots for a couple hours before leaving for my flight and got my biggest win to date! (over $900 on a $1.50 spin)    My only complaints are these: the air quality of the casino bothered us it was a long hike to our rooms and resort fees on comped rooms make it not feel like much of a comp.
50,This was one of the bests experiences I’ve had with hotels in Las Vegas. Truly worth the buck to stay in this lovely hotel. Friendly staff good drinks and a lot to do within the hotel. Highly recommend
50,This hotel is in a great location to service was great the rooms was beautiful and I was happy to have my own elevator to my room good places to eat that's not too expensive snacks was go to for breakfast
50,Everything about this place was clean. Easy to navigate through. Rooms are spacious and clean the cleaning staff is very friendly and awesome. Plenty of shopping and several choices of places to eat. The front desk was very kind and helpful with any needs we had and the bell desk held our luggage all day after checkout as we had a later departure flight. They also hailed a cab for us anytime we needed. Waitresses were a plenty throughout our whole stay so getting drinks wasn't at all a problem! We had a great time.
20,As seniors coffee in rooms is an absolute necessity and the food prices are completely ridiculous! If you’re a video poker player go downtown! Very few of them and hands made pay much less! Maybe the Hard rock will improve these issues!
40,The reason foe tge 4 star rating is that getting reservations for dining was not clear and wait times were horrible. The room was excellent. The staff top notch. The entertainment is to not be missed with Shin Lim. What a great experience. There is not a bad seat in the house. The gaming was good and all the latest games. It is clean and hand sanitizer all around.
50,The service was impeccable and the restaurants were quite tasty. Loved the Heritage steak house and Italian restaurant Osteria Costa. The steaks were very scrumptious and the atmosphere was excellent. The Margherita pizza was spot on- and we're from Chicago!!
50,My daughter and I had a great experience! The staff was extremely helpful. The rooms were very clean and sanitized and much nicer than I had envisioned. There are so many choices of restaurants within the Mirage that we didn’t have to hunt for someplace to eat. And all the restaurants were delicious. We certainly hope to be able to return to Las Vegas again soon and when we do we will certainly stay at the Mirage.
50,Always talk with Freddy at the front desk. He is amazing and made our stay beyond perfect! Our Suite was amazing and the whirlpool bath was incredible! The property was relaxed and the restaurants were delicious! Definitely stay at the Mirage while you still can. I will hold these memories forever!
50,We stay ten nights in Las Vegas and normally 3 nights at the Mirage. We stay at three different Casinos with two being MLife casinos. On this visit we were able to stay 4 nights at the Mirage and enjoyed every one of the nights. We stay at the Mirage because we can always depend on the people there to make our stay enjoyable whether we win or lose in our gaming activities. I especially like the craps table and my wife enjoys the slot machines. I like to interact with the people on the crap table. The dealers and stickman are always friendly and helpful. All of the people at the Mirage from the valets the bells the housekeepers the casino personnel and especially our casino host are all so great and keep us coming back.
50,First time in Vegas!! The mirage was an absolute blast!! The volcano show at night was amazing!! I can’t wait to go back!! Food and drugstore right across the street!! The staff were very friendly! The Mirage has restaurants to dine in inside the hotel!! They have coffee shops!! I enjoyed playing the slots!! I enjoyed sitting at the bar watching sports!!
50,Great place to stay definitely have plenty to offer with friendly workers! I would definitely recommend this as a place stay ! Has plenty of options to offer for family or couples. Definitely a great place to stay !
50,Love staying at this property have been staying here for over 20 years great place sad to see it go. If you looking for a great place next to the convention centers this is a great location and the restaurants are awesome.
50,The sports book is huge and a ton of fun. The staff were fantastic. The hotel in general was top notch. Have I mentioned the steak house? Holy crap!! It was the best steak house I have been to. My wife is celiac and they catered to her needs. Would stay here again anytime.
40,Great value for the money. We love the location of The Mirage the casino and Sportsbook are really nice. The rooms are a little dated but the property offers a great value for the money. Overall we have a very good experience at the hotel.
10,hot room AC very old hotel old stores closed. engineering had to come help me with AC in three days three times. The room was 75 degrees each day froze at night. didnt get any sleep and the front desk was of no help.
50,A good property. Had good places to eat and just hang out with one of the best locations on the strip. Was able to travel to many parts of the strip within a short distance. Room was comfortable and had a good view.
10,As a type 1 diabetic I am sometimes forced to rely on mini-fridge items in the middle of the night. During my stay at the Mirage I dealt with urgent low blood sugars and attempted to correct them with the only option I had left. I was subsequently charged $30 for two cans of Coca-Cola. Additionally my non-smoking room smelled of nauseating smoke.
50,The overall Hotel Staff and Location of the Mirage is wonderful however the smoking at the tables in the casino is unbearable if you are a non-smoker. We visited every hotel casino within walking distances and smoking is not allowed at the tables in several of the hotel/casinos. Be conscious of this when booking your stay. I will give the Staff check in process and my overall experience with our stay 5 * with the exception to the smoking. Thanks
40,The location was great. It was easy to walk from hotel elevators through the casino to the strip. Casino/main level was clean but not very many restaurant options in the hotel.  I have paid $150 for much nicer Holiday Inn rooms. I upgraded to a King room with a volcano view but I could hardly see the volcano over the rooftop. The room itself was okay but more like a $70 Motel 6 room. It was outdated and the bathroom could have been cleaned better or updated. The bathtub was rusty and the shower curtain had stains all over it.
40,I stayed at the Mirage for CES 2022 I need to preface that it was slow this year at CES. but the hotel was clean and well ketp. We at at several of the resturants on the casino floor and had a great meal everytime. It's close to the sands convention center and convenient to almost everything. I will definitly stay there again (we used to stay at Bally's)
10,If the Hard Rock doesn’t blow it up they will be mistaken. Knowing it was going to be sold we wanted to visit and experience the hotel one more time. What a complete disappointment; it has not aged well and has been neglected . The rooms are worn and out of date in fact hopelessly out of date. The bathroom is so tiny my wife and I could not occupy it at the same time. It appears MGM has totally given up on this property. The Italian restaurant is absolutely horrible greasy sauce and poorly made and spiced meatballs which oddly enough they encourage people to buy. Tight slots only two craps tables open on a busy night almost impossible to find an open blackjack chair. Asked about a possible upgrade when we checked in and the answer we received was “sure if you want to pay for it“. We were going to stay three nights we left after two and couldn’t even get in touch with our host. The Mirage is dead time for everyone to go elsewhere.
50,It’s going to be a great stay every single time at the Mirage. The staff is awesome and the rooms are clean. I love the energy there as the casino is always busy and there is always something going on.
10,This hotel was a huge disappointment the rooms are outdated the floors needed vacuumed the view sucked the casino didn't pay out. The only great thing was they had a Starbucks! We came to have a fun girl's trip and the hotel wasn't a great part of our trip.
50,The check in experience was easy and quick. The rewards desk was quick and efficient. The bar staff was attentive and make sure I was having a good time. The Mirage is my go-to every time I stay in Vegas and I have a great experience EVERY time!!
20,I would 0/10 not recommend. The room had Old chipped furniture. Toilet wouldn’t flush. Windows and mirrors were dirty. The bed had long brown hair and jeans stains when we first turned back the sheets.
50,The mirage arguably the best location on the strip rooms are very nice staff was great the hotel isn’t too big or too small just perfect one small downfall is the food options but you’re so close to everything mid strip it isn’t a huge issue
40,The Mirage being one of the older resorts on the strip is still a good quality resort that will give you the best bang for your buck. Walking distance to the majority of the best hotels on the strip. The casino is nice and their OTERO sushi restaurant is delicious!! All and all it was a great experience.
10,Brown stuff on the light switch in the bathroom mildew tore up doors and staff not willing to do anything to help Situation we had to go to a different hotel and they wouldn’t reimburse us until the day that we left
50,We live in Las Vegas and had family come in to visit so we all stayed at the Mirage. Wonderful experience Afforable and great location. We loved the tropical vibes. We probably will stay at the Mirage again.
10,This was a horrible stay. the bothroom was broken the drain covers removed. No outlet anywhere near the bed to charge you phone. want to charge for extra cups we had a penthouse suite. My luggage was never sent up they said they were waiting for me to call back instead of them reaching out
10,This place has gone down the tubes. Avoid at all costs. No one can handle an issue without routing you to 4 places.. do not stay! That being said thr bar staff was very friendly if you just visiting the hotel
50,We loved the resort. It was clean nice and fun. We would recommend the Mirage to anyone. We would for sure be returning and spending more time there. So much to do and see at the Mirage and around Las Vegas.
50,Great view of strip excellent food at heritage steakhouse. Gaming is excellent. Drinks at center bar are amazing Blantons Bourbon is excellent.  My complements to the staff and I will return. Stay there every trip. Mlife👍
40,The room was sorta ran down. We had a toilet issues tv issue plumbing issue and the shower 2 showers had diff issues one didnt get hot often was more random and the other the fixture part was semi leaking. Good price for size of the room however tub was chipping and appeared worn down a bit.
50,There may be lots of new and flashy hotels and casinos on the Strip to choose from but the Mirage remains a beautiful and lively place to visit play and stay. The casino has plenty to choose from the drinks are awesome the food is great and the rooms are beautiful clean and comfortable! No detail goes unnoticed.
50,I love the location on the strip. You really dont have to walk far in the hotel to get from gambling to food shopping. We had a great experience. Even stayed another day. The only negative is we could hear everything going on on our floor. The walls are very thin. We stayed away from the elevator thank goodness!
50,Comfortable clean and fun! Rooms are nice and so is the whole hotel. They have one of the most fun first floors with a good casino shops restaurants and ice cream. I booked for a good deal via the booking.com website
10,The rooms are dirty and I promise you dont look into and crevice near the mini bar in the room. Stay away from the 20oz bottles in your mini fridge as they charge you 18.50 + tax for a bottle of fiji water. They also will charge you $35 a day for a mini fridge so now you cant take left overs from a meal that costs you $70 a person or keep waters cold that you bought across the street to avoid paying outrages prices. Be careful as some of there rooms labeled as strip view when all you can see is Caesars palace sign. They barely have any restaurants open during the week and you have to go down the street to get any food. They list this as a resort but the property is far from that and yet they charge you 39.00 + tax for resort fees per day. And those fees are not included in the price of the hotel per night. I can promise you that there are other hotels that are much better for the same price or less and they are right next door or across the street. Hardrock just bought this property and it may be for the better as they plan on demoing this whole property. in short STAY AWAY AT ALL COST!!!!!!
40,The hotel is beautiful the room was average and there was not a refrigerator in the room to use without being charged a fee. The atmosphere was really nice. Wish we were able to visit the Dolphins in the garden.
40,Great property terrible casino staff! Pit bosses are rude dealers are average at best! Hotel and restaurant staff were all amazing! Beautiful hotel and great location! I recommend staying but do not gamble at the Mirage!
30,Everything was overpriced for no reason. Staff was friendly but housekeeping was sub par. Several items needed attention right away. Meals and parking should be included with everything else being so expensive. The rooms were comfortable and mostly quiet but should come standard with fridge and coffee maker. If you don’t opt to use the mini bar in the room you will pay $35 a day for a mini fridge. Water was $15 a liter. The average meal was $50 for two people. If you had leftovers there was no way to heat them. We wasted nearly $200 in food the 4 days we were there.
40,Mirage is gorgeous inside!! The Pantry was yummy food at reasonable prices. Center Bar has best DJ ever!!! Loved the atmosphere! Tables paid well and minimum bets reasonable for a strip casino. Drinks were delicious!
20,We received an offer for free play. The casino would not honor it even though we had it in writing from them. They said it was their option as to honoring the free play. They said since Hard Rock bought The Mirage they would not honor the offer. Even spoke to management and they wouldn't help. They got us in the door and then changed the rules. Very misleading.
40,Had always wanted to stay here n was finally able to. Paid a bit extra for strip view n was disappointed the windows were dirty n most of the view was of the roof... walls are a little thin n can hear alot of noise from other guests. The staff was very helpful n nice it is a good location on the strip is u plan to stay mid strip however if going dt or end of strip can be pretty far for that. Has alot of near by spots to eat at within 5 mins if Mirage.. good stay just didn't meet the expectations I had for it personally
40,Good location for what we wanted. Met all the needs as expected for a casino hotel. Rooms are pretty good but starting to look dated. Needed a minor repair to the shower but he staff handled it quickly and did not really become an inconvenience. But it was still an issue that should not have happened.
50,It has been a while since I have stayed at the Mirage. But I will be back again on my next visit to Las Vegas. I did not get to the shows. But look forward to my next visit. They shows at The Mirage are the best on the Strip.
50,The Mirage was wonderful. Room was very large not expensive clean quiet room and beds great. Food at restaurants was very good much better than usual hotel food. Entertainment was fabulous. Staff was very attentive and helpful. Location great. Will come back for sure.
10,The the walls that were peeling to the trim that was miss in our room !! It was a nightmare . No room cleaning after calling 2days in a row . I stay in Vegas 3 times a year and now mgm properties won’t even be a option .
50,First time staying at the Mirage. Thought it would be close to things we wanted to do. Pretty much located in the center of the strip. Worked out very nicely for everything in the middle of the strip. North or South end of the strip were a little challenging but not bad. Lot of things to do and see in the center of the strip did a lot of walking.
20,The casino portion of the hotel was ok. “The Pantry” inside the hotel has a nice breakfast. We had issues with the resort fee and our room. Not really sure why there was a resort fee. The mattress was one of the worst we’ve ever slept in. It was worn down and you could feel the frame. We stayed with another couple and they had the same complaint in their room. We also had problems getting our room to cool even after adjusting the thermostat. There are nicer places for the same amount of money. The employees were nice enough and the casino wasn’t cramped but I would not stay there again.
20,Too many hidden fees and room was very outdated booked a king size room and it was very tiny was there for four days and housekeeping only made the bed they didn’t really clean or wipe down anything and there was a lot of dust and dirty old looking furniture. Overall way overpriced and not worth it to be honest.
30,They really need to update the Casino and clean the rooms thoroughly. Especially the bathroom. Also I didn’t care for the smell of cigarettes as you walked through the Casino. Perhaps a scented ventilation system like New York New York from what I remember no smoky smell there.
50,Stayed overnight after attending the Love show. We came on a Thursday night so the room rate was great. The casino and restaurants were not overcrowded so overall an enjoyable experience. The room was clean and beds were comfortable.
50,Best experience I have ever had in Vegas. The hotel is in a great location and the facilities were great. Was there for work meetings and they took wonderful care of us. Would recommend to anyone. Only down side is they. I longer have a poker room had to go across the street to play.
20,This hotel is run down. Ice machine was broken on our floor. Outlets in the room didn’t work. The other couple with us had dried bloody boogers smeared on their ceiling (we didn’t notice them until the last day). Many of the dealers we encountered were rude. One even found it amusing to laugh when he beat us in blackjack and mock us when we won (“oh wow! $15! You’re rich now…”)
40,Due to the AC not working and the drain in the shower being clogged. Staff fixed the drain on our second day but AC never fixed. So our room was stuffy. Besides that the stay was very nice. Casino was nice. Great overall atmosphere.
50,Room was clean cleaning staff very nice . I needed help twice by front desk  very politely and correctly taken care of the casino area was active and dealers as always were great. This is at least my 5th stay here. Thank You
50,My husband & I had such a great time staying here. The hotel is beautiful well kept & clean. It's located right in the middle of the strip so it's very convenient. The food is amazing the staff are so wonderful and friendly. We had a nice room with a great view of the strip and volcano. The room price was great and we got a discount as a rewards member. We will definitely be back!
50,The staff was very friendly. I enjoyed seeing the same people over and over again. Our room was big and spacious. However the view wasn’t the best but who stays in their room in Vegas anyway? Very enjoyable stay! Will definitely stay again!
50,Friendliness of the staff I feel safe even when I come home late and I feel safe to play even after midnight and I am by myself walking around the casino clean room quiet room location  Hotel ambiance. Good Food good shopping . The public bathrooms are clean . I found all my favorite games
50,The Mirage is an older property that is well kept up. I hope that when it is a Hard Rock property that will be the case also. The staff were all so helpful and let us check in early. Travelers can tell when a property is well run when the staff are happy.
40,Evening check in went well. Bonus having two elevators serve only floors 24 & 25. Room adequate some dust small trash under night stands. Shower door leaked water. But overall it was comfortable kept clean and quiet. Location is very good.
50,I chose the “Stay Well” program which offered extra amenities such as air purification a filter on the shower for fresher water a firm mattress (like TemperPedic) and other items like a Deepak Chopra welcome message a “dawn” alarm clock that resembles sunrise and more. *You will also be on the 12th floor with a view and hallways that smell like eucalyptus.
50,My stay at the Mirage was very fun. The downstairs lounge was so fun playing music and everyone was dancing. The staff was so friendly and really allowed me to enjoy my stay. The drinks at the bar were great the front desk person was so nice and I can’t say enough about how satisfied I was choosing to stay there
50,We enjoyed our time & everything was awesome ! Us girls had a great time...very clean friendly all around great place to celebrate my birthday ! Easy check in & out. Room was ready much earlier than expected
40,Even though The Mirage is now sold it is still a beautiful place to stay in the Strip. Centrally located excellent food choices and clean. Still smells like paradise. Rooms were nice and The Oasis pool is heated! A nice touch for a January stay.
50,Hotel was nice and cleaned definitely Will be coming back and requesting a tower penthouse suite. The rooms and the view were spectacular definitely recommend staying here if you have family that way you guys can check out the pool and also the Secret Garden.!
50,I have been at the Mirage for several years as I always stay there. ALL the workers everywhere at the Mirage are GREAT! I heard the Mirage may have a new name but I hope its still the Mirage as I have an MLike forever. Take care!    FYI: I did this last week and the Mirage said they got it when I answered there email to me.
10,Was there for business and so was not in the room much. But hallways can be loud and travel into the room waking you up a times. Bath tub was not draining properly and so when taking a shower would start to fill with water. carpet was coming up from the floor and so you needed to be careful that you didn't trip over it. Like my title says was fine for my business trip but would not recommend for vacation or if you're a light sleeper
50,Went for a quick trip to Vegas for my wife’s birthday. Stayed for 3 nights and it was the perfect length of stay as well as the perfect location with walking access to almost everything we wanted to do.
10,MGM is obviously done with this property and so are many of the staff. And it shows.    Mis-management in room management and booking requests.    Time to just.. move on.. Just such a shame as this was my favorite property on the whole strip
50,I have been staying at the Mirage for more than 10 years it is my favorite since it is in the center of entertainment and above all I like the service and the friendliness of the employees they make me feel like a queen
50,This is a classic hotel and casino on the strip with rooms that have excellent views they have an awesome staff that is very friendly and extremely helpful. Also affordable and you get your moneys worth.
40,I like the smaller hotel feel and the staff was great. only the casino is lacking depth and fun. Several shows to attend and access to the strip and other locations. Restricted restaurants no buffet and other eating areas were still closed.
50,The staff are extremely pleasant very helpful  I would recommend the Mirage if you are looking for a great place to stay while in Vegas  this hotel will take care of all of your needs   Rooms are very nice
50,Excellent customer service. Check in was easy and so was check out. The bartender at the Heritage was fantastic. Safety and sanitation was a priority and I felt that the Mirage did a good job. Bring back the poker room😊
50,Love the suites and the nice staff! The house keepers have everything so clean too! The casino has all the games I like and good restaurants. The location on the strip is easy to step out to other tourist things.
50,My experience in The Mirage was amazing the staff are very friendly the room was the cleanest. The Mirage is safe to stay in these days Check-in and check-out were easier. It was very funny for all my family
50,Very nice room. Nice bathroom with great shower and soaking tub. Wish cheaper eating. Had a great view of other casinos. Disappointed in the volcano. It was not working right. Great location. Will stay again.
50,"I had another excellent stay at the Mirage. Everything went very well. The room was nice food was good and the slots were loser.  The Mirage is my #1 go to hotel on the strip an will be sorry to see it go. I think MGM really ""dropped the ball"" letting it go."
40,The Mirage is great Hotel to stay at close to everything and such a great mini bar. Bunch diverse restuarants and bars. Great Shows right in the hotel. Already thinking of staying here next year show and convention.
50,Excellent dealers at the roulette tables. Drinks kept coming while I was up about $400 started with $100 and was at the tables till 2:00am. Left happy lost in the slots but new from the time I booked I had to try my luck in roulette so made up what I lost in slots plus some
40,I have been going to Las Vegas every year since 1989. Almost every time i stay at Mirage. This year we had a special event and we invited another couple to come with us. None of us are big gamblers but we do like playing the slots. My friends told me that their room was a comp while my room was not. So much for loyalty. No wonder it is being sold. Stay was good and had a good time. Will see next time.
40,The Mirage is in a great location on the Strip. The easy access in and out of town makes driving a breeze. The Front Desk was very helpful and accommodating. I thought we had to pay for parking but it’s not to be! We did not patronize the restaurants. The lobby is worthy of picture taking. We spent Friday night at the casino. It was very busy and noisy. There’s a lot of activities in and around the area. The rooms are clean and rather big. We’re happy with the facilities.
50,What a wonderful hotel we are so thrilled to have gotten to stay at the Mirage. The hotel is beautiful we really loved the restaurants and were able to sit at the bar at the pool during the day a few times. I would definitely stay at the Mirage again.  perfect location right in the center of the strip close to everything
50,Excellent grounds and rooms and food. Otoro had great sushi and the gelato bar was excellent. Room was spacious with great bed and technology amenities.  The Snack restaurant open 24 hours served great food and desserts.
40,My spouse and I stayed at the mirage hotels for 4 new nights because of a wine tasting organized by the Wine spectator magazine as a V P and found that we had to wait in line so we will not go back to one of these. We loved Eatalie restaurant but not the casino because too many smokers . I would have put 5 stars
50,I had a 2 night stay thanks for MyVegas but would absolutely stay here again. Room size was fantastic and the beds were very comfortable. My only negative? Not a single outlet in my room near the bed for my phone. Thankfully I had packed my extra long cord by mistake. Overall I was happy with my stay and am a little sad Hard Rock is going to completely change the look of this property.
40,I was saddened when I heard the news The Mirage was sold to Hard Rock café while I also like hard Rock The Mirage is an iconic hotel w the unique volcano and Secret garden this was also where we had our family reunion w my brother and nephews coming from Paris we loved the spacious room and the view of the strip and volcano.  I hurried to book our stay here even after my sister funeral I was just worried when the change might take place and just wanted to make sue to be able to stay here 1 last time. I was particularly impressed the heater worked and it was quiet many 5 stars I stayed in had no heat!!! or a very noisy heater but I was a little disappointed there was no Frig for personal use and no coffee in the room. I would have rated a perfect 5 stars but overall I was very happy to visit again such a beautiful hotel on the strip.
50,Had a great time at the Mirage. Great location friendly staff clean rooms and hotel. They allowed me to check out at 12pm vs 11am which was great for me. They had some pretty good restaurants at the hotel as well.
40,This is a beautiful facility with effective security and great service. It was nice to have entertainment like to Beatles Love show right on the premises as well. The location was convenient and we will definitely stay here again.
50,10/10 will continue to book at The Mirage! Check in and check out process was a breeze staff quick and willing to assist. Casino was a blast. Rooms were clean on arrival house keeping quick to respond.
30,Staff was friendly and rooms were clean but the rooms itself were starting to fall apart. Water leaking from light fixture in tub. Water stopper would not stay up and strong weed smell in room. Overall and average hotel experience.
50,I’m the middle of the strip. Everything you’d need is with walkable distance. Airport isn’t that far either. Convenient stores and restaurants nearby. Friendly staff. Clean hotel. Nice theater. You won’t regret staying there.
50,I enjoyed my stay at the Mirage everything was very nice and looked beautiful. Only thing I wasn't notified of was the extra deposit taken at check in for the room (which you get back after checking out). It would've been nice to know about this either before or after booking the reservation just for better planning.
50,Had a great time at The Mirage customer service as excellent from Bell Service to Check-in to dining and shows. The bell service staff took the time to explain the hotel and options within the hotel and was very fast to get our bags.
40,Great Vacation. Rooms was clean and nice. People were very friendly. The location is Awsome! and you are able to walk around to see the strip. Plenty of games to play and played for hours and hours. Craps was the best.
50,One of my favorite resorts.. Sad to see it go. Staff is friendly didn’t know they had DJ on the weekend that’s new to us. That was fun.. it’s smells amazing walking in. Room are clean. Food is good as well
50,My family has been staying at the Mirage for years and I actually got married here about 10 years ago. This particular trip was great because of the friendliness of the staff. We arrived early and although our room wasn’t ready Shelly at the front desk moved some things around to get us in. After a long drive it was much appreciated. Stephen at the roulette table was so engaging and personable I almost didn’t mind losing so much money. Almost. I was disappointed the pool was closed because of winter but I guess that’s understandable. We can’t wait to go back this Summer!
20,Check in was good casino is good room was not. Incredibly dirty plugged drains with hair in tub stains on the towels mirrors windows lamps etc were all dingy and needed replaced. Room was not pleasant for the price. Water from the tap is nasty and the bottles are stupid expensive to buy. Eatery’s on location are fair at best but very very over priced.
30,Our family asked for 2 adjoining rooms. Instead we were separated one floor apart in different elevator banks with no access to each other's floor. Stairs are closed for security reasons. We could only meet in the lobby.
50,I stayed at the Mirage for a work trip and from the clean room easy check-in beauty of the property delicious food options and super clean room I couldn’t have asked for more. The staff was very warm and welcoming and the resort is smack in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip.
30,The hotel is centrally located which is a plus. Hotel rooms are outdated. Sheets had stains and tears in them. Bathroom ventilation is poor. Shower head is too high and water pressure too strong. Shower curtain is old and stinky. I saw several masks on the floor for days as well as a needle on my way to the room.
50,The hotel is great for its location cleanliness spacious rooms and the kindness of its staff. Easy check in & out and good wifi connection cover all hotel building. Worth staying in and I enjoyed it.    There are various restaurants in it ranging from a steak restaurant to Starbucks two a small supermarket and some stores as well as in it Beautiful garden. The parking building is adjacent to the hotel and the walking distance is very short to the lobby compared to the parking buildings of some hotels it is the best
40,Had a lovely upgrade to the 2 bedroom Hospitality suite and it was nice to relax in the morning and the evening. There was plenty of room and was nice that we each had our own bathroom. The casino was extremely clean. The Pantry and Snack Shop were delicious also. Will be sad to see the Mirage change hands.
40,Great weekend with great friends minus loosing my money and it’s a problem at all casinos is the machines card readers not working so hard to truly track play! And only bad thing was the bathroom size
50,"The hotel casino entertainment and overall experience at the Mirage was amazing! The ""Love"" show is probably the best show I have ever seen. The food and shopping is convenient and makes it where there is no need to leave the hotel."
40,We booked the tower king room on the 24th floor. Mobile check in was easy and the room was ready when we landed at 1:35pm. Do stop across from registration to get mobile activated keys and room keys if you want. The room was perfectly clean and maid service was excellent each day. The property was recently sold so not surprised that the room was a little dated and in need of a refurb. This was our 3rd stay there over the years and we’re glad we stayed one last time. Going to miss the place . We have always gotten a very reasonable room rate it’s clean with great service and an awesome location.
20,We tried this hotel and it seems the check in people donot value the customer I asked when I reserved for strip view and was confirmed at the check in. Went to the room it’s looking at the 15 hwy and the weird the check in person Didnot do any thing or he made him self non knowledgeable of what happened.  Please respect your customers and tell them if u need more money to have the view
50,Excellent place to stay. All of the staff from arrival to leaving went out of their way to be helpful. The dealers were for the guests housekeeping above and beyond bell hops kept cabs and drives smooth everything including the delicious food was terrific!
50,This was a weekend trip with friends and we chose the mirage due to its location and great reviews. We were not disappointed. This was a comfortable place to rest up after a night on the town. You could also find plenty to do on site with several restaurants shops and shows.
10,My experience at the Mirage was horrible they left cleaner spray in my room they wouldn't allow me to order movies without putting a credit card on file because I paid with a debit card so I put a credit card on file just to have my credit card and my debit card charged over $600 for free rooms
50,Had a great stay at Mirage. I’d heard about the sale of the property and had concerns that it might effect the service. Staff was fantastic. Rooms were spotless No lines and friendly dealers all 4 days.
50,The overall experience with this hotel was great! Was great from the start as soon as we pulled up to valet! To the very end at our checkout! Thank hotel has a friendly staff and is a very clean hotel! I’ll definitely be coming back to this hotel.
50,Because of the tower construction your views are panoramic. For a standard room the amenities are nice such as extra mirrors and drawers and a nice work station at the desk. I would not hesitate to recommend Mirage for the perfect balance of luxury and value.
40,The hotel was older but clean and the staff very friendly. Wish the restaurant’s hours were longer but understandable in these times with lack of staff available. It was great that the pool are was open. Even at 60 degrees the way the pool area is set up you can get a tam in January
50,Beautiful and clean rooms. Hotel is right on the strip and lots of activities to do. Staff is friendly and very helpful as well. I recommend to stay during the week than on the weekend. My stay was on a Wednesday and checkout on Saturday. Such a big difference in crowds on Weds vs Fri. Overall A great Hotel. A shame its been sold out 😔
20,The staff was amazing I definitely want to say that! The rooms however were dirty and outdated. I didn’t feel like complaining while I was there because we had a decent room rate. Around the bottom of the bed was very dirty(standing dirt and dust). Curtains were torn and dirty and shower and sink didn’t drain well. The bedspread had several stains and/or dirty spots on it. All in all we felt like we had to shower off the room when we got home.
50,I will miss this hotel when it becomes a hideous Hard rock. The rooms are smaller & a little dated but I do really enjoy the hotel vibe. The staff were very nice & you can check in without going to the front desk which was amazing.
10,"Folks be aware that security here does not monitor their parking garage. In fact they could care less about keeping your car safe. Some idiot blatantly vandalized my car while it was sitting right underneath one of their cameras. Their security guard Dustin took a bunch of pics and had me write out a report. It must have been all for show because he didn't do a thing about it and their risk management lady Leslie played the ""cya"" card like trusting them and their security was a bad idea and I never should have trusted or depended on them in the first place. People you will leave this place hating it go to a hotel that lives up to its name not one that is literally the definition of it."
50,The Mirage is in a great location and has two bus stops in front of it. It is very clean and they have a wonderful selection of restaurants and bars available. I've stayed here before and will stay again.
50,The staff was very friendly and always made sure you were taking care of. The casino floor was very clean and abundant servers walking around for drinks. The room was very clean and the mini fridge was well stocked. All restaurants on the property were very good and the restaurant staff provided excellent service.
50,My wife and I stayed at the mirage three years ago and liked it so much that we decided to stay again on this trip to Vegas. Every staff member that we interacted with during our stay was very professional as well as very nice. There were a few bartenders at the center bar that were outstanding and our server at the still was helpful and sweet.
10,The reality of this is the Mirage was once a grand dame. MGM since buying it never put a dime in keeping it up. The only reason I stayed there was they gave us 2 free nights and it was a business trip. Everything is worn dirty and not upkept. The staff was the same. Do youself a favor and spend your holiday somewhere else
40,Stayed in the resort room and it had a musky smell and normal bathroom. Pillows and sheets need to be renewed as the pillow’s seem to crumble and the top comforter has passed it comfort shelf life. Service was excellent and the location in the middle of the strip is very convenient.
40,Unfortunately upon arrival I found several issues with my room. So went back to the front desk and explained my concerns and they upgraded me to another room free of charge and offered me a discount on my next booking. So have to give them credit for going the extra mile to make things write. Also want to give a shout out to Patricia the housekeeper for not only doing a good job but for taking the time to talk to me and help me find my way around.
50,Great place to stay. Nice rooms. Staff was incredible. The bartenders at the sports book bar are the best. You can't go wrong. Went to the Pantry for lunch. They serve breakfast all day. How can you go wrong with all day breakfast.
50,We love this location & the rooms are very clean. Fun casino & good restaurants. We’ve stayed here many times & always keep coming back. The hotel has nice little shops & a Starbucks for my morning coffee
50,Had a great 4 days in comfortable clean room at ideal location along strip. Great value at price we paid. Good choices for casual meals. Do need to open up more gaming tables but like everywhere I'm sure staffing is an issue.
40,Good stay! Wish we could have adjoined our rooms especially with how empty it seemed but it was the only sad thing about it! And now im just typing to fill in the space but it was definitely a trip to remember!
50,Had a wonderful stay check in was fast room was clean bed was comfortable. Staff at the lounge was very friendly. Mike the bartender was very nice and he even took the time to call and make reservations for us to have dinner at Heritage. 2 thumbs up
50,Upon early arrival we found there were two reservations not one. They cancelled the second without penalty. We were given a very nice room with front strip view. Even though early 9:30 am we were given a room right away. The casino was comfortable and fun. The location was close to the Venetian convention center and many other areas of interest.
30,Most all restaurants were closed on the property. Coffee hard to come by 24hr store in hotel was not 24 hrs. Price of just about everything at least double to triple normal prices. You're gambling with your wallet if you forgot something at home and buy it here. In room Snack bar is a trap with as weighted system on it you lift it you buy it. No fridge for personal use unless house keeping has one you can use. Not sure I would stay at this resort again.
50,check in on the app was extremely easy and having everything on your personal device and not waiting in line was next level. Great job. I would highly recommend to anyone for business where time is valuable and can't spend time waiting in line.
10,Mobile check-in app doesn't work & is a waste of time. Lots of water damage in the main bedroom and main bathroom - had to mop up floor inside toilet area. Called and waited over an hour for someone to look at it had to cancel because we had trade show booth to attend Shot Show and couldn't sit around. Entire bathroom was not very clean - wiped but had hair stuck to walls! Lamps in main bedroom were bent and crooked. Living area couch in bad need of full vacuuming. Entire room seemed 'worn & tired' and was way overpriced for the condition of the room.  Bathroom mirror in attached bedroom was dirty and full of water streaks that ran down from top to bottom all across the mirror. Italian restaurant food was marginal at best - however service was wonderful. Japanese restaurant was great along with service. Staff was great all around.
30,Great property needs updates but overall worth the dollar amount paid. Table selection could be drastically improved. Great food and service but not enough night life to compete with Bellagio or Caesars.
50,We were pleasantly surprised with our stay for a quick weekend getaway. We loved the location the room the casino (low minimums on roulette!!) dining options friendly staff even at the tables and pretty much everything about this resort. We frequent Vegas three to four times a year from Texas and this has been one of my favorites even in comparison to Wynn and Venetian. Definitely ranks above Grand in my books.
30,Paid double the price since I booked early in Sept for Jan. trip.  Resort fees were $200. and for what? It was Jan. to cold for swimming.. Not sure what resort fees cover! Sorry Mirage always wanted to stay at your hotel... unless its free.. I won't be back
50,The entire facility was awesome room was clean and comfortable casino was laid out nicely bars and restaurants we used were staffed by friendly and fun people who seemed to make sure you were taken care of and appreciated
50,Amazing staff and Resort. Everything was clean and above expectations. Staff went above and beyond to make sure I was a happy guest. They gave me an amazing room at a great price. It made my trip that much better. Highly recommended will be back.
40,The reservation was confirmed and then a print out of costs. However when I arrived at Mirage there was a surprise large deposit required to check in. This was not on the print out. After checkout I caught a plane and now almost 24 hours later I have not receipt of Mirage expenses. I did NOT CHARGE anything to the room and need to know if everything is kosher. I NEVER have received my deposit back yet. This is wrong and not a comfortable and transparent way to do business.
50,I asked for an upgrade when checking in. The front desk said they were full but could offer a suite @ 50% off. We upgraded to the 2 bedroom penthouse suite! It was an amazing experience for my 40th bday.
50,Just arrived home from a quick weekend at the Mirage. Just as we expected. Our favorite spot on the strip to stay. We've never had a bad experience staying at the Mirage and is also in a great spot on the strip. Highly recommend.
40,Always satisfied with Mirage and overall experience in this hotel. i have been staying in this hotel for years in a row and have no plans to change that in the future. It is positioned very good in comparison to where I have to go for the exhebition that I visit during my stay.
50,The mirage is a very Comfortable place to stay with family friendly and very helpful staff everything is close in the mirage this was a great weekend enjoying the NFL divisional round games and gamble.
20,Messed up my reservation and comps. Atmosphere and rooms adjacent to urs was too loud. When I called the desk they said they would send security up to clamp down the screaming kids. Well that didn’t work they were loud all night.
10,Pool closes at 4 which is not kid friendly at all. We came with our kids not to drink and gamble. The volcano was shut down for the week for scheduled maintenance. You own your own website how about you mention that I booked a couple days before. Walking from the parking garage surprise you pay like 29 bucks to park there you used to never have to pay for parking at the casinos so stupid. No personal use mini fridge they just store drinks which cost an arm and a leg. I will never return.
50,Staff excellent bed excellent facilities excellent food excellent. Location was excellent people excellent vibe in hotel excellent casino was popping. Weather was really nice. All in all couldn't expect more from Mirage.
40,In town for World of Concrete. Room was clean and people were friendly. Missing some options for breakfast in the morning unless you like Starbucks then you are ok. The one breakfast restaurant was packed with a 45 minute wait.  Location is perfect and easy to get in and out of.
40,Here for conference. Room very nice. No refrigerator in room though. Bathroom is small & fan was very noisy. Went to Shin Lim magic show one night & Beatles Love show another night. Exceptional shows glad we went.
50,Great stay around! Love the theme and landscaping! Pool area and restaurants were outstanding! Awesome location near the center of the strip. Close to other attractions and restaurants! Comedy of Aces show was fantastic on site!
50,Had a great stay as always at the Mirage in Las Vegas. Friendly and competent staff make you feel like family. Thanks for making our so enjoyable.we can’t wait to return in the spring. Also had most of our meals in the hotel and enjoyed them all.
50,Met up with family from Texas for a soccer tournament. Also met up with family from Northern CA who were there for a football kicking camp. We got to enjoy our time together and explore the strip. Overall the hotel was a perfect fit.
20,Shutting down many features after selling the property yet charging the same prices shameful. It demonstrates a total lack of integrity and lack of concern for the consumer. A very bad reflection on management/ownership. Extremely disappointing
30,It was a very relaxing trip though the scare of contracting covid-19 still looms large in the air and we could definitely feel the paranoia but overall it was a fun trip and I strongly suggest that people start traveling again back to Vegas especially the MGM properties as they're practicing safety and following covid-19 protocol.
40,Really nice staff throughout good food although all dining options were not always open (perhaps covid?!). Was missing a coffee maker in the room and poker tables in the casino to completely meet expectations.
50,Great location for anyone going to a sands convention center event. easy access to the strip and all the amenities on location if you just want to stay in.Room was nice the whole facility was very I will return
10,Awful Experience Bathroom so small Toilet was nearly hit by door Weird sucking flush. Shower. Filthy. Tub outdated. Lifeguards at pool. Creeps! Front desk “forgot” to check us out when we checked out. Charged Credit card. So terrible
50,Super friendly folks that I interacted with! Security drinks and everybody! We had a blast. Just didn’t sleep. But I don’t think that’s the Mirage’s fault. ;) cheers to the next time! Thanks for the great staff!
50,The Mirage has a great vibe and ideal location mid-strip. The casino and restaurants are well laid out and there are a nice selection of eateries.  The rooms are spacious and quiet and the beds comfortable. The “fish tank channel” and “the fireplace channel” are particularly soothing after a long noisy day in Vegas.
10,After check in we found ourselves in a double queen room locked out of our adjoining suite. When we got into the suite it was filthy & not ready for occupancy. After some hassle we were moved to a new room.
50,One of the nicer older hotels in Vegas. Mobile check/Digital Key was great addition. Only con is no coffee makers provided in rooms they said it was a fire hazard due to being 30 story Hotel. Odd that NYC skyscraper hotels and hotels everywhere across the USA provide coffee makers.
50,The hotel is always very very nice and clean.  We have been going to this casino since it opened  in 1989. The food is good and always bizzy in there.  They just need to get a food court put in.  We had a good time.
30,Difficult to walk distances to obtain food. Long lines and waiting for food. Very expensive. No room service. I certainly down sick while there and no help. I walked 35000 steps in 3 days. Not used to that hurt all over.
50,This hotel is wonderful. Many great restaurants on the property the highlight being OTORO Robata Grill & Sushi where the food was fabulous. The room was large and clean and The Beatles LOVE show (the reason we made the trip) was fantastic.
30,Had to ask for a new room due to the deteriorating state in the first room assigned. I think a mouse was chewing the floor board and the bathroom was just moldy falling apart and water pressure was like Niagara Falls but painfully strong.
50,I decided to fly out to Vegas for NFL Wildcard weekend to place wagers on the games. I took my Aunt with me cause she enjoys playing slots. We stayed at the Mirage where the customer service was top-notch. Will definitely return soon!
50,We visited to experience the Beatles Love Show to celebrate my daughter’s 25th birthday. It was phenomenal and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The staff at hotel were pleasant and professional. I highly recommend it.
50,Had an amazing time staying at the Mirage. Made it a point to stay as it will soon be the Hard Rock. Was our first time staying at the Mirage best location on the Strip. Staff was very professional in every experience. Will be back.
40,Mirage is a well located and had easy accessibility to the center strip. The hotel could use some upgrades to the lobby (really low lighting) and the rooms (dated). The hotel provides good value and service quality
30,Very mediocre experience. Prices of everything have doubled and what you get for your money has decreased. This hotel needs to have a routine maintenance schedule on their AC units to prevent people from getting sick from the massive amount of mold in the units. Also don’t waste your money on the Beatles show. It’s one of the worst shows I have ever seen in Las Vegas.
50,Great hotel with awesome and friendly hotel staff! We stayed in the two bedroom penthouse and loved the view we got and how stocked as well as clean the room was. The mirage was a great choice as it’s in a central location in the strip
30,Room is dirty and smell like cigarettes called down to the front desk To let them know what the issue was if they could send somebody up to clean and spray with air freshener and that did not happen. Poor service for sure
40,family of 4 in Vegas for a soccer tournament. there was a water leak in our bathroom and they resolved the issue quickly and gave us another room. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. unfortunately the volcano was not working while we were there.
40,I stayed at The Mirage on Thursday Jan 13 for 4 nights. This is probably my fifth or sixth time at the Mirage with it being my third time in the past several years.    I had a resort Tower room on the 24th Floor 24052 to be exact. I used mobile check-in and went right to the room; although we did have issues with the mobile app key -- so I did get keys made at the mobile check-in station.    I love Floor 24 &25 because the wait for elevators is pretty minimal considering the two elevators only service those two floors.    Our room was nice. It was predominantly clean the furnishings were in pretty good condition the bed was nice the pillows were great and the bathroom was nice as well. Is everything brand new and perfect? No it is not. But it was nice and clean.    I don't expect that Mirage will put a lot of money into the resort in the coming year while they work to close on the sale of the Hard Rock.    We tried the Pantry for lunch which was great. We also used the gym one time which was well equipped. The parking garage was easy to get to from the front of the resort. We did not try out the Pool or other restaurants.    Overall it was a great stay. I will truly miss the Mirage when it starts to evolve later this year into the Hard Rock Resort. I know they will be keeping the Mirage name for a few years; however we all know that construction is going to start this year when the new owners take the helm.    I'm excited to see what the new owners do with the resort; however as one of the original mega resorts in Vegas I will always treasure the Mirage and the value it brought to the Las Vegas strip. The theme and ambiance was one of my favorites.
40,First time staying at the Mirage and my wife and I were very happy with our room which had a view of the Strip and Volcano. Bed was excellent room was quiet and location next to Caesar's Palace and across from the Venetian and Harrah's was outstanding. And the Shin Lim show at the Mirage is incredible and amazing; no bad language no off-color jokes just amazing card tricks by Lim and amazing mentalist performance by Colin Cloud. One negative for us was the fact that there was no buffet at the Mirage but there were plenty of restaurants and other options across the street and next door. FYI my wife and I loved Guy Fieri's restaurant at Harrah's. Outstanding pasta and burger.
40,Room was noisy. The door doesn’t provide much of a sound barrier. Who goes to Vegas to sleep though. 🤣 Room was nice. The location is great if you want center strip. Wish they had an indoor pool and hot tub for the winter months.
50,One of the best on the Strip. Staff could not be friendlier and the sportsbook is solid. Highly recommend. The Beatles Love show is one of the best. Tower suits are well worth the expense and provide that Vegas feel to the trip every time we go.
40,Location was excellent room was very clean friendly staff . The only problem I had was the fact that they asked for a $300 deposit at check in because they have a mini bar in the room so if you grab any of the items there even if it's just to look at it and put it back they will charge it off of the deposit. In my opinion a mini bar should be optional specially when you have kids with you and they don't always listen when you tell them not to grab any of that stuff. Fiji water was $18  what a rip off !!!! Again I think the mini bar/fridge full of liquor should be optional not obligatory.
50,This is the 7th time I have stayed. I have always been pleased and keep referring friends there. It is definitely the best value on the Strip. Close enough to walk to any of the popular places on the Strip. The casino is great but the customer service is even better.
50,great location. easy to find our way around the casino to the elevators. my only problem was there was no tub stopper in the bathtub when we wanted to take a bath so we had to wait. 1 call and it was fixed. the guy at checkin was great and explained parking and services to me. the gtm was nice and the jacuzzi was open. but i paid for a stripview and it was more of a strip peekaboo view. i had a great view of the freeway though.. i wish i had come here befor because i would come here again if they wernt tearing it down
50,This iconic property will never disappoint. Whether it be the dinning entertainment or the overall atmosphere of this legendary property you will not want to leave this paradise resort. Visit the iconic volcano show on the strip the Secret Gardens of Siegfried and Roy watch the Beatles Love and take in the fresh aroma of the tropical coconut vanilla scent that the Mirage Las Vegas offers. I highly encourage you to visit this property and see all it has to offer before it is destroyed by Hard Rock as they transform it into a horror show of epic proportions.
50,The staff and atmosphere at this hotel are so incredibly inviting. People I want to give KUDOS to: Thatch (valet) Martin (brought our luggage to our room) Warren (a supervisor who fixed a glitch in our dinner reservation) the desk clerk from San Salvador (who got us registered) Willi (spa woman who got me to my massage) Kirsten (massage therapist who worked out all the knots) and Kord my partners massage therapist (“he was fantastic”). What an amazing staff and this very fine Las Vegas hotel. Thank you for making our experience the BEST! Everyone here is 5 STARS ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
50,"The woman at check in was extremely professional and very friendly..gave us our (too) early check-in options. We passed by many attractive restaurants while walking through the lobby almost all of which turned out to be very good. (The Japanese restaurant was incredible!) Everything's spotless and while our room was of the ""standard"" tryp - it was in no way small. everything was clean & new. One could stay on the hotel grounds for quite a few days and survive quite well. Some great shows playing there too. I'm not sure what else you'd be looking for beyond this. There's a sports book and even they were very friendly!"
40,Checked into hotel and asked for an upgrade was told it would be $150/day. Uh no. Went to room on 22nd floor west wing and was surprised how small bathroom was a single seat and 6” between toilet and door swing. Room was nothing special
40,This place is going to be missed! The hotel was very clean and staff where all helpful and friendly.    15th floor room 25 - nice view and able to see the volcano. It erupted every hour starting at 7 pm. Windows were well insulated we didn’t hear any street noise. The window in the middle opened and was scary as a child could have fallen out of the opening. Bed and pillows very comfortable. Plenty of space in the room. We also were able to have the goodies removed as our kids would have moved them all if they stayed out.    Highly recommend checking out the Secret Garden. The dolphins are something to see. Most of the tigers were sleeping when we arrived around 11:30 am.    Steak house Heritage was pricey yet delicious. Can’t go wrong with Justin wine. Bone in Rib-eye with blue cheese was cook perfectly. Crab legs were salty small and not very many for the price. Would not recommend them. Octopus was too chewy and the sauce was strange. It would have been nice to have had lemon instead of the sauce. We also had the potato puree good not great. French fries for our son were delicious and not one fry was broken they were all nice long pieces. The cheesecake with fresh whipped cream and strawberries was the best way to end.
40,Great staff and security good location disappointed with rooms. Rooms weren't cleaned to excellent standards and maintained poorly not sure if it was because of unawareness or simply neglected. Good for just a place to sleep
50,Mirage is a great place to stay in Las Vegas. Friendly staff and clean. Great shows to see and the pool area is very open. I have been staying here for several years and will continue as long as it is open.
50,Our stay was awesome! The registration staff was awesome. So was the housekeeping staff as well. We had a great time! And the unexpected upgrade was like the greatest surprise ever. We appreciate all the efforts they took to keep everyone safe with mask reminders since there were two large events going on at the same time!
10,Stayed here many times was disappointing light didn’t work in the bathroom bathtub was filling up with debris don’t know where it was from it wouldn’t drain air condition it was so so. Would not stay here again!
40,The hotel is in need of an upgrade and it is good that the hotel is now sold and wil get just that.    Even thou it is and older hotel and you can tell it is still a nice place with a good value for the price that i paid.    Room was big and nice atleast for the prica paid.    Glad i got to stay at one of the most legendary hotels in Vegas before they change it to a Hard Rock.
50,I enjoyed my stay and had an amazing experience the staff was great and helped every problem I had and answered all my questions very beautiful scenery and the casino games were fun. I would recommend this hotel to someone else during their stay in Vegas
20,There seems to be confusion with the average bet and comps. I was told 2 different things from 2 different employees at the mirage. I wouldn’t recommend. I actually stayed here about 8 times before this trip. But I won’t be back.
20,Hotel Mirage is very nice clean friendly & good location. I was on business. do not use FEDEX freight desk inside the hotel.  Their manager Aaron is misleading & very shrude. He quotes me $250 & then said it was $870 !  Be careful if you use their service !!
20,My husband booked a room at the mirage for my 30th birthday.  Upon entering our room there was an odd smell. After we started settling in we noticed there was vomit on the floor that had not been cleaned.    The front desk promptly moved us to another room. However this room had its own issues. White powdery substance on the furniture and broken pieces of furniture. The tv in the master suite did not work. There was large holes in the master bed’s sheets.    Overall we are very disappointed with the Mirage..
40,We chose the Mirage hotel and casino for anticipated convenience. We had tickets to see the magician Shin Lim who was performing at the Mirage. A couple days before our arrival we received that his show had been cancelled for about 10 days. We think the Mirage should have given us a discount perhaps one free night.
40,Hotel provided decent service. Overall it was just a hotel. Didn’t get treated like they wanted people to be there. Hard to explain you will understand how I felt when you are there. Just a reminder that vacation will not provide everything
40,It took us over a dozen trips to Vegas before we finally tried the Mirage. Wish we would have tried it sooner. The check-in went smooth and the huge aquarium in the lobby is incredible. We got a room with strip and volcano view. The room was small and dated but certainly functional. Our safe did not work (they came up and got it working) and the bathroom is very small. We really enjoyed the size of the casino and had a couple of meals and drinks on property. I used the weight room and thought it was very well equipped. The location on the strip cannot be beat it is easy to cross Las Vegas Blvd and easy to walk north and south. This is a great property the employees were friendly and in the 5 days we gambled we always had good wait staff serving drinks. We felt safe and the property was just the right size.
50,Have been staying at your hotel for the past 12 years during the NFR and would not stay anywhere else. Everything is within walking distance and the food is great. The steakhouse was exceptionally great!
10,The front desk staff was rude and totally unhelpful. I was due to check out on Thursday but there was a mix up in my reservation and they had me checking out on Friday. I still left on Thursday night but I used the room to keep my baggage in it on Thursday sine they wouldn't give me a Thursday checkout. When I went back to the room the key didn't work and the front desk checked me out in spite of the fact that they were still charging me for Friday. Totally unprofessional. We brought over 1500 attendees to your hotel and as a result of the way I was treated our show will not be coming back next year to the Mirage or any of your hotels.
50,The Mirage Hotel & Casino is my favorite place to stay in Las Vegas. Everyone is so nice friendly and accomindating. Checking in was fast and smooth my room had a view of the volcano and the strip.
10,Really old property slated to be torn down soon And as it should be. Although Iconic on the strip it's day has come and gone. The staff in the restaurants are great except in Costa. And of course if you are covid weary stay clear. No mask mandates here.
50,This was our second trip to Vegas within a year and both times we stayed at the Mirage. We love it! It’s clean and just feels comfortable when you’re walking around. The Beatles “Love” show is there and is a must see! Also The Mirage is in one of the most ideal locations. It’s pretty much in the middle of the strip. So we spend one or 2 days walking down one part of the strip and then the other days walking down the other part. You don’t feel as tired at the end of the day b/c you’re not walking all the way from one end to another. We didn’t even use the monorail this last time. But should you want to use the monorail one of the stops is basically right across the street. AND the MGM loyalty program is amazing! :)
40,I really enjoyed the time I spent at the Mirage. This review would have been 5 stars but the do not have a Poker Room at the Mirage and live cards is some of my favorite gambling. Regardless the hotel feels very upscale with marble in the bathrooms and newer machines available. We saw Ron White performing at the hotel and that was the main reason we stayed.
50,Every staff member went above and beyond their duties for us! I absolutely loved that you had plenty of security to make sure everyone was wearing their mask! Thank you for thinking of our safety!! It means a great deal to me.
50,I've been staying at The Mirage 2-3 times a year for the last 15 years. I love this place! My most recent stay was a lower floor 11th but was a volcano and strip view...was awesome! Love being mid-strip and so close to everything. Room and casino very clean staff are great. Really going to miss it when Hard Rock takes over. I'll be back in two weeks and plan on staying a few more times before the transition.
50,We LOVE this place! It never gets old always getting updates has beautiful scenery & has great restaurants! It’s such a treat every time we come 2 Vegas the Mirage is at least 1 day 1 night. Are great food & played cards like crazy!
50,Chose to stay at the Mirage for a mini anniversary getaway without the kids. Room was clean bed was comfortable casino was clean and inviting and staff was nice. Had dinner at Heritage and was able to have concierge book us time at Top Golf.
50,I love everything about The Mirage  the location  the room  the services was excellent  we're lookinf foward to go again and stay at The Mirage . What we loved the most was the staffs staring at the lobby everybody was so welocming.
50,My wife and I love The Mirage. My only complaint is that our room wasn’t ready when we checked in…not a problem. They said we would receive a text when the room was ready. Around 9pm we hadn’t heard anything so we decided to go check only to find out our room had been ready but we were never notified.
40,It was good just could use a little more up grades such as bedding and the mattresses are a little worn out and the linen and pillows are worn out. The Casino is very nice the staff was great.NOT A GOOD VARIETY OF FOOD
20,Was absolutely shocked that I was unable to use the refrigerator in the room without buying the alcohol inside of it. No complimentary ANYTHING in the room. Even Motel 6 gives you coffee and a microwave
40,The Mirage is definitely the Oasis in the desert. With friendly staff and greeting restaurants all my expectations were met. While you are there be sure to check out Tge Beeltle Love Show. You won’t be disappointed
50,Everything was perfect. Loved the digital keys and check in. It made everything so fast and convenient.The strip view was phenomenal. Our room was clean and ready to go an hour earlier than expected which happened to he right when we pulled in from a 5 hr drive. Was so thankful.
50,Mirage has perfect location on the strip. Beautiful atrium large aquarium behind front desk is mesmerizing. Went for anniversary trip and front desk congratulated us. Got us great room with a view and accommodated us arriving early.
50,Amazing trip! The staff here is excellent the machines are fun with a great variety! Our stay was free due to our MLife rewards with a complimentary upgrade to a quiet room. Would love to stay here again before the changeover!!!
50,We came to the hotel after our flight was cancelled and had walked through while staying at Harrahs. It was such a great experience. After being tired in the airport we asked if there were any rooms available with a view and we received a corner room with an excellent view of the strip. We felt so welcome and loved the room. We will be back
50,Awesome hotel. Classy and well maintained. One of the nicer looking interiors in all the strip. Not stuffy like others. Amazing restaurants. On the best part of the strip in my opinion. Rooms were clean. Staff was friendly.
50,Room with a view was great friendly staff. The pantry restaurant was terrible service and so we left and didn’t eat at the hotel anymore for the rest of our stay. Gambling was great enjoy the overall vibe of the mirage
50,Love the atmosphere and energy this place has. Enjoyed my stay sad it’s being sold. Although extra services like the Spa and restaurants were pricey it seemed on par with other places on the Blvd. Had a great time.
20,. Check in and out was great. Saturday evening I had someone from the staff walk right in on me to check the min bar without waiting for an answer to coming as I was sleep in bed . But I didn’t have a card on file mini fridge didn’t not open. So how was I i on the list for rooms to be check when I clearly said I didn’t want room service. Then I checked out waiting for the rest of my party to come down and walked over to the Starbucks to see if they was open. I make it over they told me they was closed so I just was walking around checking out the hotel art before the switch over to the hard rock I got approached by one security at first then two more walked up. I told them what I was doing and Waitting for Starbucks to open at 6am and he followed me all the way back to the first like I was being profile. I made a call to speak to security manager and it was like it was brushed off. Said we was just doing our job looking like I was lost. When I been in and out the hotel all weekend I’m very upset and touched by this situation and how it was handled. I didn’t looking like a bum off the street I had nice clothes on my luggage in hand. And if guests are not supposed to go in that part of the hotel then I’m sure it need to be tapped off or sign of hours when guess can walk in that area by the ball room. Very Displeased
40,Did quite a bit of reading through reviews before selecting the Mirage. Did book a Tower room (saw that was a must). Our room was really great - possibly the nicest bathroom I've ever had - it was huge. Heard the Mirage was just bought by Hard Rock and will be torn down. Such a shame - beautiful resort and certainly seems to have a lot of life left in her.
10,I hear that the Mirage is going to become The Hard Rock and that is probably a good thing. Room is dated and loud you can hear everything in adjacent rooms. We used a white noise machine to sleep. Staff not happy in the slightest I realize it is the time of COVID but really just a blah vibe. I cannot believe the price I paid for this room I thought it would be nicer than Luxor or PH but it most definitely was not. Don't stay here until they remodel.
50,Went to Vegas for a friends birthday and we had an over all excellent experience. Saff was all around friendly and helpful and I honestly wanted to stay longer than our reservations. If what I have heard is true I will be very sad if the Mirage gets torn down and replaced. I will hate to see it go.
50,The only place I have stayed for the last 7 years The best of the best The nicest people beautiful room great food and the Casino is perfect Comps are great Mlife is the best. Sad to see that change...
50,Sports Book was very helpful & the staff working in the Spa on 12/29/21 were extremely helpful and friendly!!! Rooms were clean and beds very comfortable! We will definitely book another stay at Mirage.
10,We visit LV 2-3 times per year and have done so for many years. Before retiring we would have an occasional conference or convention. Now it’s for a fun getaways and this weekend at the Mirage was anything but fun. The room was dirty and the tub is someplace I would never step in to. I asked for a blanket because the room was impossible to heat and I got a comforter that was torn and tattered. Probably the worst weekend I’ve spent in Vegas. Will never stay there again.
30,Great location and service. Tired and dated hotel and restaurants.The Beatles Cirque show was not playing and hotel was relatively out dated. Black jack dealers were friendly. I always wanted to stay at Mirage but likely will go elsewhere next time.
50,as always 3-4 trips yearly the Mirage is still the best on the strip. Staff is best and friendliest of all casinos. Only regret is that MGM is selling the property to Hard Rock so it appears that my trips in 2022 will be our last at the Mirage and we will have to find another MGM property that compares it at all on the strip.
40,Stayed 4 days room was clean bed was comfortable views couldn’t be better food was delicious no matter where you ate will return only complaint couldn’t get any kind of beverage on the floor while gambling
20,Hotel is dated and they charge for everything. There's no mini fridge but there is a fridge that holds things you can buy. For the price this shiz should be free. The rooms are about as recent as circus circus rooms. Definitely will not be staying again.k
20,It is clear the sale of the Mirage could not come soon enough. Just finished a stay there and you can tell it is in dire need of a refresh. MGM is horrible when it comes to use of customer oriented tech and if they have it self checkin etc it will 100 percent fail. MGM is stuck in a time warp from 20 years ago - a tech inept incompetent team.
40,Great location towards the middle of the strip. Hotel is on the older side and you can tell. Our bathroom while clean did not have a toilet that flushed well. Our sink stopper was broken. The bed was very comfortable. Not a lot of channel options on the tv and no fridge except the stocked one. Casino was very smokey. Nice selection of restaurants and pool area was large.
50,Every aspect of the hotel and casino was excellent. From the dining choices to the room we had with a view of the strip. From our first check in to the parking attendants upon our departing everyone was friendly and cheerful. Casino was well kept and upbeat with a fun crowd to be around. Don't forget to check out Love in the Mirage Theater. It was breathtakingly astounding!
50,Great strip view hotel! Everything in the hotel was extremely clean and well-maintained. Hated to see when I was out there that MGM had sold the property. Definitely stay at the mirage while it is still standing!
50,The only hotel I’ll stay in Las Vegas The service is great the people are friendly and I feel very comfortable there. We will be going again in March and can’t wait. Why try another hotel when your treated so well. The dealers are very friendly also.
50,I love this exceptional hotel. The staff is great the restaurants are wonderful and the place is always clean and well run. We love to stay here because of the easy walkability to the attractions near by.
50,My wife and I stay in casinos on the Vegas Strip 8-10 times a year. In December we decided to try out The Mirage and were surprised at how nice a casino it was. We stayed in a suite (they have multiple floors that are all suites) and it was large clean and as nice as almost any place we have ever stayed. All staff we interacted with were pleasant and helpful. The casino floor was average size and very clean. We will definitely stay at The Mirage again.
50,Hotel and casino were super clean. Also 100% of the staff at the hotel restaurants bars etc. were super helpful and friendly. Best staff experience I have had in Vegas and I have stayed at all the upscale resorts.
50,Great!! Had a fabulous time. The Costa restaurant was excellent. Service was good. Check-out was easy. We will be back for a girls' trip soon. Was a little surprised at the resort fee at the end. Didn't know about that.
50,This was a fun trip it was planned few months back and the whole thing was a pleasure the staff were professional and great service the rooms were nice clean and beautiful view I loved everything about it the cousino's was fantastic I had win $400 B after 3 days and I'm looking forward to come back soon and I would recommend this hotel to all my friends and family members
50,The Casino and hotel room were clean and well maintained during my stay the restaurants bars and gift shops were great as well. I also enjoyed that the Mirage casino/hotel is located in the middle of the strip so it's close to all the other Vegas sites. I enjoyed everything and had a great vacation!! I'm looking forward to my next visit at The Mirage!!!
50,Upgraded to a 1 bedroom tower suite at a discounted rate. Check in was easy and staff very helpful. I surprised my wife with the group and she was very happy. Room was awesome clean spacious and furnishings were comfort and in good shape. Ordered roo. Service and it was prompt food was warm and well prepared. Definitely worth it.
50,If you’re in Vegas for the NFR this is the place to stay. Fee live music every night free shuttles to and from Thomas & Mack and great restaurants to boot. I typically stay here 2-3 times a year and I’ve never had a bad experience. The pools are also very nice in the summer time.
50,Had a great stay at the Mirage. So much so that I booked our next event there. Great service. Love the rooms and ease of getting from room to casino. Many great places to eat right at the hotel. Bartenders were all great..
50,The staff was helpful and Friendly. The rooms was comfortable and well decorated. The restaurants we ate at was suburb we ata at the steakhouse yesterday and the filet was perfect. The gambling experience was fun. The slots allowed you to play a long time on your money. We will definitely stay again and recommend others
50,Excellent place and affordable very comfortable and right in the middle of Las Vegas Strip. Close to the Monirial train and other attractions. Have a lot places to eat close by. Recommend for family.🥰
20,Make sure that when you book your room they also send you an email stating how you can pay for your room and deposit so that when you arrive it's the same payment they told you before you arrived. Meaning what can be paid by cash and what needs to be paid by credit card all needs to be sent by email so that it's not and issue when you arrive.
40,"The Mirage is still a gem on the Strip after 30-something years. I like to stay here because it's where the Griswold's stayed in Vegas Vacation (Admit it you still watch that movie too). The hotel itself looks just like in the movie (they've kept it up!) When you walk through the green house you really feel like you're on vacation whether it's July or January. The location is great and the staff is very friendly and attentive (even more so than at higher priced hotels). It's big enough to feel like you're in Vegas but it's not over-whelming where you're walking 10k steps just to find a restaurant or a bar. The rooms are decorated nicely and they do a good job making it feel bigger than it is and that you're in Vegas. Great views too. I wanted to try Pantry but we weren't feeling good the morning we left. We did eat at Snacks (cheeseburger and tator tots -- pricey but good!)    A few cons:    You have to drag your luggage through the casino floor to get to the room elevators. It was probably a fun idea in 1989 but who wants to do that nowadays? And getting to the elevators is exactly like the scene in the movie where the desk clerk instructed the Griswolds.    The rooms are showing a little wear (scratches on the walls the phone was all beat-up the shower had a slow drain/clog. And the bathroom is tiny compared to Vegas standards. (The property itself is in great shape). And the doors are paper thin so you can hear conversations in the hallway.    The mini fridge didn't even have a price list (or scannable QR code). Not that I would buy anything anyway. Who actually does that? If you're rich enough to afford the mini fridge you should probably be staying at The Wynn or something. Realistically that fridge should be empty to allow guests to keep drinks and leftovers. It would at least help to justify the outrageous ""resort fee"" and make for a happier guest experience.    All in all I'll return as long as it's the Mirage (can't believe Hard Rock bought it). It's an iconic mid-to-upper range hotel (in my opinion) and should satisfy all your Vegas needs. It's great for couples and families. I just wish they displayed some Vegas Vacation memorabilia."
50,We came for the weekend of new years and there was a lot of hotels charging an arm and a leg for their rooms and the Mirage was one of the more decent priced hotels and they did not disappoint our stay in vegas!
30,Rooms need improvement no fridge no microwave no coffeemaker hard pillows outdated bathroom. Hotel is very well located and the Beatles Love show was #1 but you can stay anywhere to see them. Bye
10,The Mirage is charging resort prices for motel 6 service during a global pandemic where they’ve closed most amenities. I won’t be going back. Ever. Probably not to any of the MGM group hotels whose standards are deplorable. They don’t enforce non-smoking they don’t enforce a mask policy. My whole family got covid staying at the Mirage. The room had broken plumbing leaks behind walls and was generally in a sad state. Big business can do better especially given the massive bailouts they’ve received from the government during this pandemic. I feel like I got robbed.
50,Mirage is centrally located and had everything you need in LV! The restaurants shows casino and accommodations are all great. We have stayed at several places on the strip—Mirage is our favorite. We’ll be back!
20,The beds in the 'Stay Well' section of the hotel are so uncomfortable. The room had an air filter sound machine and shower filter which was why I booked it. I also thought the bed would give us a good nights sleep. It did not. I woke up with everything aching. (I'm 29 and have never had my hips hurt from a bed)  I do not recommend.
30,Too many large pets in house and on property I saw a pit bull labradoodle golden retriever. Place needs service lot of machines out of order. Amenities were mis matched and quite comical. Restrooms are outdated
50,I loved and enjoyed my stay at MIrage I had a blast the hotel has so many great amenities. I enjoyed my little get away with my man. We l will come back here to Mirage and we recommend this hotel to everyone!
50,Great hotel! Room was large and view of strip and volcano was phenomenal. The Heritage steakhouse is amazing. The iceberg wedge salad was surprisingly flavorful. The prime rib was cooked perfectly and honestly one of the best I’ve had.    Get a M life card and save on room price too.
50,First time at this MGM property. Was very pleased great services and friendly staff. Has a slight issue with a charge to my room but the issues was resolved swiftly. Dinner at several of their restaurants and enjoyed all of them.
50,Visited LV with family and found Mirage to be very convenient good rooms and rates. The staff was very helpful and friendly and many food options were available within the hotel. Self parking was appreciated and convenient to hotel. Hotel was not as 'spread out' as other down the strip. However would not eat at LC's Heritage Steakhouse...steaks were over-priced and over-cooked!
50,We really enjoyed our stay. At check-in an employee from the front desk showed my kids a magic trick and gave them a quick behind-the-scenes look at the aquarium behind the check-in counter. The line was long and my kids were wiggly and this was a life-saver! Thank you.
50,Our New Years Eve celebration at The Mirage was just EXCELLENT!! All the staff at the hotel was friendly and extremely helpful. The restaurants were great on site. The Pantry had the best Belgium Waffles I've tasted! Would definitely stay again!!
50,Mirage is the best 5 star hotel to stay on the strip hands down. Everyone there provided great friendly service from housekeeping to front desk and the parking attendant. The only thing I didn’t like was the high resort fees & parking fees. Due to the pandemic we’re all a little pressed for cash so I feel the mirage she work on how expensive they are with resort fees & parking.
50,We will be back to this amazing hotel the service we received was amazing and above and beyond this was my kids first time to Vegas and had an amazing time there weee no issues checking in was fast and simple touch less
50,We loved the self check in. The room was clean with a beautiful view of the volcano. We truly enjoyed our stay. Plenty of places to eat. We ate at Diablo's and have eaten there before. Food was good but waiter seemed preoccupied.
50,We appreciate everyone here at the mirage. Everything went well from the time we arrived till the time we departed even with all of the new years crowd arrivi6and departing aro8the same time. The lady answering calls in the concierge was very informative and helpful with helpin8plan out our new years countdowns plans. Thank you for everything and we'll be back soon for sure.
50,Enjoyed the room and atmosphere and close to the places I wanted to go. Stores were awesome and the night life was great. The room was like living in an apartment and it was nice and tidy and clean. Awesome
10,No room cleaning and only 1 in 4 days  No shampoo and soap for 2 adults  Shower was very old and barely water came out  We asked for refrigerator but never received one  We booked the room with resort view but we ended with parking lot view
40,We called for a blanket and it took 2 days of calling to get it. Otherwise it is a nice hotel. Clean and the location is great. Staff was very nice. Views are very nice too. Lots of things to do and lots of food.
30,Seems like the Mirage is getting older with little upgrades. We had a strange odor coming from the carpet but the hotel could not move us to another room. We had to walk all the way down the hall to get to our room.
20,We wanted to love the Mirage but it just wasn’t great. We’ve stayed at many hotels on the strip and this was our least favorite by far. The room across from us had a dog that barked at all hours for 3 days straight! Everything was just mediocre. Would not recommend.
10,Would take my money elsewhere. They showed multiple times me and my money and time didn’t matter. Spent fifteen hundred on a basic room with no fridge view or coffee maker for 3 nights. Spent over 2000 on the casino floor and couldn’t get a drink and when was brought to the attention of a pit boss and Carlos the bartender was told to pay for the drinks or don’t come back.
30,The rooms are very small beds not very comfortable and its a noisy place as you hear everything in the hallway room around you. The curtains don't close tight and a big light shines on room at night. It's ok location but this is my first and last time staying here
30,Terrible bed very uncomfortable  Stay well room was not very good  Not filtered water as advertised  Rusty tub  I have stayed at the Mirage several times in the past and always have enjoyed it  Table games are over priced go across the street and have more fun for less risk
20,They should offered to move us to better room or give us big discount. It was a dangerous situation because the leaking were at the light. Front desk said nothing much they can do except to give us discount on our resort fee which was like $35. Terrible!
50,First the hotel itself is very beautiful! The staff are friendly. We had an amazing view that was provided as an accommodation to a reservation issue. They have the best careshare/taxi system I know this because I tried a few of the others and they were very confusing and disorganized. Beautiful place. One negative is that their standard rooms are a bit smaller than I would like but that didn’t bother me.Go ahead and book. You won’t regret!
50,An amazing hotel!    My husband and I stayed here for five days from Christmas Eve to right before New Year’s Eve. We stayed in one of the penthouse suites on the D Floor And it was amazing. The room was gorgeous huge and huge the bed was so comfy. This was our first trip staying at the Mirage and it is by far one of my favorite all-time hotels. The music they pipe through the casino was awesome the food on the premises was delicious and cocktail service was always available while we were playing slots. My husband and I were super impressed. Our next trip will definitely be at The Mirage.
40,The Mirage is still one of the best locations on the strip and the view for the New Years Eve fireworks was incredible. I know it’s was recently bought out but apparently it is still keeping the Mirage name.
50,Great experience overall! We will definitely stay here next time we are in Vegas. Friendly staff all around and lots of different options for slot machines. In the middle of everything we needed pretty much and Fat Tuesday’s is right across the street!
50,Loved the central location in proximity to other casinos. Loved that as soon as you got off guest elevators restaurants and casino were close. The convenience of everything was great…even to the main entrance doors.
50,We enjoyed our stay. We had a king size room which was clean and in great condition. The restaurants onsite were good we just wish they stayed open later. The casino was fun. Masks were enforced inside and a pain. The pool was great. It was very busy but we found some chairs. The water was heated. The mirage is in a great location. The volcano is fun to watch.
50,We decided at the last minute to go to the Mirage in Las Vegas for the fireworks. Best decision we have made. Food was great service was great at the front desk and restaurant. Had a great time watching the fireworks.
50,We love staying at the mirage. This is my second time first time with just me and my husband and this time we brought our kids. I’d say both experiences were great and the hotel was nice for both purposes. We drove this time so parked in the garage. Don’t prepay for the parking. I ended up paying again because it wouldn’t take my prepaid barcode. The area is nice and has a close location to most attractions. We love the volcano and my kids still claim it was their favorite part of our trip. The room was a little muggy but I’m sure that comes with being an older hotel. It wasn’t a deal breaker for us.
50,Rooms were very spacious clean and pillows/bed were perfect. Small enough that you don't get lost finding your room. Will definitely be back. Restaurants have a great variety as well. Even won at the blackjack table :)
50,"Had such a great time staying at The Mirage (under MGM ownership yet). The hotel is beautiful... and an excellent variety of restaurants with delicious food! The Cirque ""Love"" show is the BEST show on the strip (and I've been going to shows in Vegas for 40 years.. and now have seen ""Love"" five times!! (It's THAT good!!) The people working here are the best.. and they make you feel valued. I really hope the Seminole folks at Hard Rock maintain this.. but I've been to a couple of the Hard Rocks (including Hollywood Florida) and they did anything but make a person feel valued. So hoping Hard Rock seriously improves their game as a strip player (as MGM is the king at making guests feel valued and taking care of their players)."
50,I been with Mirage for over 15 years every to Vegas only stayed Mirage. For 2022 I will be back next HOLIDAY coming or sooner Valentine's birthday anniversary summer for kids enjoy beautiful poolside!!!
10,The room was dirty. The bed was lopsided and uncomfortable. The bar and casino staff was very rude. We spent a lot of money in the Mirage but left to gamble elsewhere because our experience was not the greatest.
30,This casino/resort has a history in Vegas with the volcano show in front of it and that’s part of its charm. It is a good resort. Not great and not awful. There really isn’t anything that seems to set this place apart from others. The decor is oddly mismatching eras from 70’s to 90’s decor all mismatched together. Nothing is truly updated to modern standards. Decent location on the strip but a bit more North than I’d stay next time I’m in Vegas. Casino is small especially the table game area. Didn’t win anything. I think this casino is probably much more appealing in the summer for its pool. The tiger and dolphin exhibit seems out of place. I’m sure it will be removed when the Hard Rock rebuilds in its place. Stay here to say you stayed before it was torn down but don’t expect much.
40,Review written in the survey. Stay was satisfactory but the hotel complimentary Amenities was an opportunity. Hotel in room prices were outrageous and the bathrooms are in need of an upgrade . Staff was very friendly with exception of the bar . I had a complimentary coupon given to me for signing up of sports betting and the bartender was less than friendly when he recognized that I had a coupon for a free drink which was given in very small cup. When I received the service it prevented me from ordering a drink from the bar due to the lack of service I received with my complimentary drink.
10,I decided to stay here for my birthday and Christmas worst decision ever ruined my whole birthday check in experience was a joke told the lady it was my birthday and she didn’t care was was charged two deposits one for 400 and the other 200 for two reservations which would’ve been fine but when making the reservations I was told completely different and the lady didn’t care my room had a view of rooftops of the building next door bed was hard as a rock housekeeping only came twice during my entire six day stay and didn’t give me fresh washcloths the two times they did come and didn’t change my sheets I will NEVER stay here again worst experience I’ve ever had in Vegas
40,First time staying at The Mirage and I was very pleased. Hotel cleanliness and the spacious room with a desirable view was the highlight. Also I'd dropped my bag at the bell desk until check in. The process was easy and once I got to my room the bell desk said 10 mins and the person was at my door within that time frame.
10,Hotel was okay for an average experience. I wouldn’t recommend or go back. We had to request housekeeping & it wasn’t done.  Costa the Italian restaurant had lipstick in my glass of water and waiter argued that he had never seen that before instead of a simple apology & my parmigiana was cold.
20,Too many things broken. Lock on bathroom door TV input refrigerator. Alarm for the whole section went off at 7am without an explanation…. In general you are better off elsewhere. The Beatles Love show was great though.
30,Great location older hotel. Roomes  Are outdated. Staff took  Long to come and service us. It was a busy weekend….overall happy with stay but wouldn’t come back because the service took too long. Thank you anyways
20,Outdated casino. Lack of restaurants shopping and amenities in the casino. It is very small and boring compared to other resorts on the strip. The price for the stay isn’t priced low enough to make up for the lack of options this hotel offers.
20,Stayed in Resort Tower 25th floor room 106. Disappointed could not use refrigerator. Every inch of the mini frig is stocked with many types of liquor. I was hoping to be able to keep few bottles of water. There are plenty of snacks stocked in room as weĺl...if you lift any of these items from their places for a few seconds be prepared as the mere action is now your purchase.  Disappointment continues...the lights in the bathroom went out 3 of the 4 days I stayed at the Mirage. When I called front desk I was given instructions on how to use the re-set button on bathroom wall. I was told the hotel is old and sometimes the fuses will blow. Well...that lil fact was not conveyed when I paid $1400 for hotel stay. Huge question....who in Hades goes to luxury hotel and has to flip the switch to get their lites on in your hotel bathroom???  I requested to speak to Manager with incident #3 with lights. To the hotel's credit the first time I called front desk to report the problem I was given re-set instructions with a caveat. If I could not re-set the switch engineering would be called. I was able to re-set the fuse. As the guest i was not aware fuses are my responsibility. Ultimately engineering was called.  My compensation was to remove $100 for the resort fee. Poor resolution. Will never stay at the Mirage again.
20,Our room was on the 24th floor at the very end of the building so everything was a long walk. Mask wearing was crazy--they HAD to be worn but were mostly just chin warmers. What's the point? Everything is so expensive there and the gaming tables were not user friendly at all.
40,The Beatles “Love” was awesome. If you want to stay here for ease to walk to the show that’s a great idea. If you wanna play poker there isn’t a poker room.    Also where’s the second bar of soap? Makes sense depending on who you stay with.
30,We just went for 2 nights to see the Beatles LOVE show. We paid extra for a room with a strip view which I’m not sure was worth the extra money. The rooms have been updated but still seem tired. The bathroom was small and the rooms were clean yet stuffy. I’m glad that we could crack the window open a little bit.
40,For an older property Mirage (MGM) was a very good value for us. Rooms were nice clean and well set up. Felt the price was very good for a Strip location. Had walking access to several great shows. Beatles Love is a must see. Loved seeing the dolphins from our room window.
40,Once a wonderful resort on the strip that has been allowed to deteriorate. I trust the new owners will upgrade the resort to keep people coming back. Restaurants were few and the Buffet absent. Open shops overcharged for simple things like a coffee. Needs a complete make-over to attract quests in the future.
40,Hotel overall was nice however we had issues with the shower clogging up and the toilet was very loud when flushed. Maintenance had to be called twice for the clogging issue. We had two rooms and toilet was extremely loud in both. Also hotel was unwilling to grant late check outs.
50,Mirage puts you in the heart of LV. Nextdoor to Caesars shops and restaurants directly across the street (with pedestrian x walk) from Venetian/Palazzo shops and restaurants. Clean cheap and good service with staff everywhere to help.
40,This is a good property but you can tell it’s a little older and needs a refresh. The staff is friendly and our room was clean. Check in and check out was a breeze. Every staff member we encountered was nice and helpful.
50,We reserved the penthouse suite and it was gorgeous. The gaming floor is small but well equipped. Restaurants are all top notch. Wish we could have seen Love but had to cut our trip a night short...and the refund was easy to get.
50,Had an amazing stay at The Mirage. Great staff clean rooms and amazing amenities. The bathrooms are a bit dated but that’s the only thing you’re find that needs some attention. The cleaning crew also deserves a shout out!
50,The many times that my husband and I have stayed at the Mirage we haven’t been disappointed. The customer service that we get at the front desk and M life rewards are always helpful friendly and accommodating. They are always willing to help us with anything and that is one of a kind.
30,Overall the hotel is ok. Just wasn’t very convenient compare to other nearby hotels. There is no food court. Also they charge $18 for a bottle water that’s way too expensive! Staff there are very nice though I gave them 5-star.
10,Wanted to surprise the wife with a romantic holiday getaway. Absolutely loved playing craps blackjack and poker in the casinos. Had a great time. Bed and room was super comfy and the dealers were great. Unfortunately they dropped the ball when they didnt log in my card at the MGM and give me my gaming points. I lost out on all comps and no one seemed to care enough to fix it or comp me. Very sad
40,Nice hotel with great staff. Resturants closed earley for a place that is open all night long. House keeping was great and dealers were mostly fun. The first night we waited 45 minutes for the volcano and 5 minutes after it was supposed start they cancelled it due to wind. We never got to see it go off. That was disappointing because that was one of the reasons we chose to take our kids there. Overall it was a good stay.
20,This hotel used to be considered high end nice and was always a go to when we wanted to stay somewhere clean and nice. It has gone downhill. The rooms are in disrepair the casino is dirty the restaurants are not that great anymore. The bathroom had tons to mold. The bed was broken. The room smelled and the window leaked. Everything was very work out and broken and dirty. Not impressed at all anymore especially for the price.
10,Dirty room half eaten bag of food left used toiletries trash on the floor. Not recommended. Very busy hotel rude service members. Was told at guest services short on staff which is the excuse everywhere.
30,Good place to stay only if they come clean your room. Always stayed there since we love the mirage and had a good experience before. But this time our rooms were not cleaned for 3 days and even had to call room service to ask for toilet paper.
30,This was my first time booking the Mirage. I booked a regular room then upgraded to the Penthouse at the end of my first night. I was disappointed at amount of money for the Penthouse with all of the repairs needed to the room. If I ever book there I will not pay for another Penthouse. I'm just leery due to my experience not to say the staff will make sure this experience does not happen to another customer. I do thank the staff for working aimlessly to get everything fixed.
40,Got the volcano view room. Felt like it was a decent size but would’ve liked a bigger restroom. It was rather small for 2 adults trying to get ready to go out at night. I could also hear the outside commotion of our neighbors which I can do without at 4am. The view was nice and hotel was clean. Lots of sanitation stations to clean your hands. Casino is really clean
50,We stayed at this hotel with our kids. It was a perfect environment for kids and adults. The online check in and use of the app was clear to understand. No waiting in line or face to face contact needed. We appreciated the secret garden available for the kids. We hope to experience it next time we go. We loved the volcano show. We did get the wrong room (strip view) instead of volcano room. Once we noticed they were happy to offer the correct room. It was a slight inconvenience but it was corrected so I guess that’s okay. The rest of our experience was great. We shopped In the hotel gambled drank allowed the kids to sight see we grabbed coffee at the Starbucks on the way out. We valued that the hotel is pet friendly and we’re also excited to utilize that next time too!
40,Our experience was great overall with a few minor glitches. The first room we checked into smelt of mildew. However it was remedied immediately. The other issue was the bathroom was a little dated. Otherwise it was a great turnaround trip for us. Wish we could have stayed longer but only flew in for the Usher concert.
50,It's our first family vacation since Covid. This was our 2nd time staying at The Mirage. We love their restaurants parking hotel easy access location of the hotel on the strip and both indoor and outdoor shows. It will be even better if we win! LOL!
40,It had been years since I had stayed at The Mirage so I didn't know what to expect. I chose it because of the central location. I was pleasantly surprised by the room. The $50 F&B offer did not work as advertised though.
40,Don’t believe the comps ! Disappointed- when booking room stated $40.00 free play when checking in and then going to MLife desk stated none available - bait and switch. The comps for anything below a $100 should be standard for any booking. Stop with false advertising MLife. Another reason I will be checking out other not MLife associated casinos in Vegas.
50,We love the service and atmosphere of the mirage! The Holiday decorations were beautiful and festive! We always love the floral displays! The food and service are always great! The mirage is a classic part of the Las Vegas strip!
30,Maybe it’s just Vegas. This place is total insanity in every corner. Just an assault on the senses even for Vegas. The rooms were tired and seemed not very clean. Not a single option for kids on the TV. Gym only open 8am-5pm.
10,Horrible property. Platinum card holder and overcharged. Ridiculous. I expected something and wasn't given what I was expected. The Still restaurant sucked too. Service was horrible. Waitress on her phone instead of seating us.
50,We got married here 13 years ago. Now we bring our kids with us. 11 10 and 7. They absolutely love coming to Vegas. The swimming pool and tiger exhibit is their favorite. This time we even went ice skating (nearby). We used to come here to JET nightclub (before kids) and this property will always be our favorite.
30,We were surprised how dated the Mirage was particularly for a hotel in the heart of the Vegas Strip...the king room we had did not have any charging ports or even plugs to charge phones on the end tables. The room was clean a decent size and the hotel has a great location across from the Venetian Hotel and close to Ceasar's Palace but we would not recommend the hotel. Unfortunately the Volcano at the hotel was not operating while we were there. The Hotel does have a Secret Garden where you can see dolphins and a few wild animals (lion and tigers) but you can buy tickets for it without staying at the hotel.
10,Terrible checkin process and few nasty employees especially at the bell desk. Also they charge $8 for a bottle of water inside the resort. Overall not worth the extra premium..Treasure Island is much easier
20,Nothing great about Mirage apart from its good location on Strip and Volcano show but u don’t need to stay here for that.    Everything is below avg in the room and super expensive for no reason.    Basic stuff like microwave mini fridge atleast 1-2 bottles of complimentary water… all of this was missing.    They literally charged us $18 for a bottle of water 🤷‍♂️    Positive stuff:  - location 👍🏻  - checkin was super easy with app  N thats all
50,Location was close to everything. Right in the middle of the strip. Makes it a lot easier to get from one location to another. Get the daily parking pass. You can park on any mgm property with that pass. It also reduces walking time on the strip
30,I liked the location . I thought the mandalays room were nicer. I think food and drinks are over priced . 23 for a breakfast sandwich is ridiculous from the Pantry. I had to ask for room service . Beds were comfortable but room needs updating. Shower pressure was great
20,We had a 2-bedroom suite very well priced but I wouldn't take the bargain room again. Toilet vented into bedroom no plugs around bed to plug in phones/ devices tvs didn't work room wasn't ready on time. Service was fantastic though.
10,"Door with gap in the bottom let's light and all kinds of noise in all night and unfitting curtain also lets light in from outside. Broken (actually missing) towel hanger. No electrical outlets on neither side of night stand for your phone. Bathroom does not latch to keep it closed. It just swings open. Tiny 30"" or so TV brightness just goes so dark you can't watch it. However staff was nice and hotel was clean."
50,The penthouse suite is a great place for families who wish to have privacy during the pandemic. I highly recommend it - great price for a strip hotel. Other hotels charge double the price. Although this is an older establishment but they have great restaurants.
50,Got myself a suite for my birthday and had the absolute most amazing service super friendly staff amazing room perfect view of the volcano no one bothered me and felt completely safe all at a relatively decent price. Thank you!
10,It was announced that this resort was sold recently and it showed. The rooms were disgusting the elevator is so loud that it made it almost impossible to sleep. We left a day early just to get a good night's sleep. The staff seemed to acknowledge everything we complained about but had no solutions didn't try to work with us and seemed resigned to working in a run down resort. In other words the staff knows how bad it is but also know that MGM isn't going to invest people time or money into running this one. Stay away! For the price there are much better options.
50,I wish if they have a coffee in our room. Other than that it was great stay. Great location clean and good customer service. The Pantry's restaurant staff need more training. After all we had great time.
40,In house Starbucks was terribly dirty. However staff and casino was generally friendly and helpful. Room had a clogged bathtub but I'd still revisit. Room and hotel are beautiful well kept and had lots to do.
50,Beautiful and convenient enjoyed the dolphins and tigers and Cirque show. Dining and gaming areas are great shops are nice Top notch hotel. The only one complaint is rolling luggage over lengthy carpeted area to elevators on arrival. Loved this place!!!!
50,Great customer service. Clean room. Nice view. Love the waterfall the plants  and the fish tank. The Christmas decorations were beautiful. So I give this resort a 10/10. I will definitely be coming back once the weather gets warm.
50,Overall I'm very satisfied with Mirage hotel and Casino andits staff! But I wish the parking was at least free or a little bit cheaper. The cleanness of the room and the hotel itself was noticible. I wish we could win a little bit at the Casino.
40,I’ll prefer to my friends The Mirage  I’ll stay again at this hotel and casino on next my vacation along with my family because most of your service people are very nice and friendly even the room service person.
50,I really enjoyed my stay at the Mirage. I downloaded the app to check-in mobility. I completed my half but I never received confirmation of my room number so I had to check-in in person. Although I was not able to finalize my check-in online I still recommend the app. I was able to use the parking pass in the app at different MGM properties parking garages. The parking garage fee was $15 a night. The hotel if centrally to everything on the Strip. I stayed on the 15 floor. The room looked clean and didn’t smell. I would have liked more restaurant options to eat pass 11pm at the hotel. The one restaurant that was open pass 11pm was still good; I just wanted more choices. The room didn’t have a mini fridge but you could have one sent to the room. Bottle waters are expensive in Vegas and so is the minibar. In all I would definitely stay at the Mirage again.
30,Perhaps this applies to many other casino hotels on the Las Vegas Strip. But for us having stayed at the more family friendly type hotels in the past few years (Embassy Suites Homewood Suites Holiday Inn Express etc.) there were a few things we missed. There is no fridge in the room only a minibar with outrageous prices for everything. There is no coffee maker in the room. And certainly there is no microwave. Also you cannot lock the bathroom door. Not sure why.    It is very convenient to be in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip on one hang. But the distances are huge and we found ourselves using the rental car quite a bit anyway.
20,Went to Vegas for a couples weekend and to relax. Couldn't use the hot tubs because they close at 4pm and weren't open with covid even though other hotels on the strip have reopened theirs.  The hotel room was small and lacked a coffee maker. They wanted to charge us $35/day to use a refrigerator. They nickel and dime you for everything. Guest rooms are loud and you can hear everything going on in the halls.  The air quality on the casino floor and hence in the restaurants is terrible. You're overwhelmed with cigarette smoke at all times. Chose this hotel because the shows we bought tickets for reside there won't stay here again.
50,My birthday was on Dec 22 right on the day I stay at the Hotel. That why I booked this trip to celebrate my B-Day but when I mentioned this to the front desk I did not receive any exceptional for it. It's really disappointed.
40,Excellent hotel  I love it  but the mattresses inside the rooms has to be changed immediately it’s life time came to an end long time back otherwise everything was as expected  staff who attends the room calls are aggressive needs to be trained on customer care basics
40,I stayed in one of the Stay Well rooms they provide at the Hotel and as soon as we walked in it smelled like lavender. The beds were very comfortable. And the view was awesome. The only complaint I have is that I assumed that the Stay Welk rooms would have a nice bathtub. It was a pretty regular bathtub and the bathroom had no lock. But it was a very nice room otherwise and I would definitely stay here again.
40,Beautiful Casino floor with a beautiful lobby. Rooms are mid range as far as luxury when it comes to Vegas. In general it’s an attractive time and place to be seen. There’s a great variety of restaurants within the casino itself. You will enjoy the location that’s not far from any of the attractions on the strip.
40,I enjoyed my stay. Loved that it’s close to major attractions. I just couldn’t see the volcano from my window because of the big dome blocking my view. Doors are not heavy. As I could hear people walking outside kids screaming and dogs barking
30,"Considering we paid extra to have a ""special"" room in the ""Tower"" we were somewhat disappointed with the lack of attention to details - such as bathroom lights kept tripping breaker & staff could not fix."
40,first time at Mirage. it was a nice stay all around. would stay again and enjoy the pool in warm weather. location on strip is nice and staff was friendly. hopefully the buffet opens back up. also hope to see the Beatles show.
20,I stayed at the Mirage over 20 years ago and I had some found memories of the guest rooms the big aquarium in the lobby and the fancy swimming pool. I just came back and unfortunately it was winter so I didn’t go back to the pool. As for the rest of the casino I feel like they need to blow up the place and start over.    The guest room was extremely outdated. The bathroom was something you would see at a low end motel - extremely tiny and dirty. Although it had been cleaned imagine having your bathroom at home that hasn’t been remodeled in 40 years.
50,This hotel is very nice. The scenery with the volcano and the water is a nice touch. The staff are very friendly here. The rooms are nice and even the standard rooms are spacious. The casino is nice and there is easy access to food right across the street if you don’t want to eat at the hotel.
20,It was a family trip and birthday celebration hopping to enjoy the stay we got of to a rocky start with the room not being properly clean. Would I give it a second chance in the future yes. It would be the last time if it happens again.
50,Great services great room and overall outstanding trip! Had a penthouse suite which was more than we could ever use. Service and customer friendly approach was off the charts! We will miss the Mirage when it closes next year!
30,Key rooms have issue again and again after requesting the new ones. Hotel doesn’t provide sanitizer and masks at the room for their guests. Changing the keys is hassle because waiting in the long line in order to talk to the receptionists
50,The Mirage is a very laid back resort. We had an awesome view from one of the cheapest rooms. It's close to so many awesome places. Eat at the Pantry which also does their room service. Go while you can. The hard rock just bought it. 😒
50,I would recommend the stay here easy and convenient for the whole strip. The restaurants and bar was nice and wouldn’t mind going back. I really loved the breakfast sandwich at the The Still Draft Crafts and Eats but the orange juice wish it could be better.
40,My experience went well as my room was fairly clean and had a nice size bathroom (although it would’ve been nice if the bathroom had a lock). Casino itself had a nice selection of slots the gambling tables weren’t too expensive ($10-15 min) for roulette/blackjack offered mask. The few issues I saw was that they didn’t enforce the mask policy as some people walking around didn’t have a mask another issue was the lack of variety with their selection of restaurants (upside they had the pantry which is a must try breakfast spot). Overall it was a very good hotel as you can walk to other hotels and take the tram (closed when I went)
10,Worst mlife stay of my life. Dirty rooms no towels or soap smoke smells rooms. Staff unhelpful. Over charged at checkout. Zero of the promised $50 credit made available. Usually mlife is better but this was one of my worst hotel stays ever.
50,I love everything about this hotel! The staff are always attentive helpful and courteous.  My room was very clean stocked and I had a great view!!  This was my third stay at the Mirage and I will definitely be back🎄
50,Me and the Boys stayed once again at our favorite location- The Mirage! Great location AWESOME personnel and you feel in the middle of everything. Good Christmas decorations and good food. Great bones of a building The Mirage. I hope the Hard Rock folks refit her back to her former glory!!!
10,The ventilation system in the facility don't work at all; the smell is just unbearable compared to other hotels (You will notice it while walking on the strip); the entire furniture in the rooms needs an upgrade room 21123 lacks some curtains you will get full light.    Positive note to the staff and to the Cirque Du Soleil - Beatles show they are just awesome.!!!!
40,Brought my 13 and 8 year old daughters. Staff was phenomenal. Location is great. Resort is easier to navigate then most. I will absolutely stay here again. Good value and the best shows on site. Rooms are fine but we didn’t come for the rooms.
40,Well maintained property friendly staff and reasonable rates. Suggestions for improvements: Free daily water and coffee for the room. Need to work on parking system where room keys work for parking as advertised.
30,Stayed here four nights right before Christmas.  Pros: easy quick check in. Elevators seemed to work moderately fast. Ice maker worked great.  Cons: Room was in pretty bad shape. Mold on ceiling in bathroom. Rusty bathtub fixtures including the drain which would randomly shut while showering. Shade pull broken and coins next to bed that I noticed on the third day and who knows how long they were there. Pillows were soft and lumpy. Housekeeping did not come one day. I called them in the evening after I came back from a show for towels. They would pick up the phone but no one would talk. Maybe no one spoke English? Also it seemed that most restaurants on site did not take advance reservations and Diablo's was closed while I was there.
40,Not the same Mirage. No Buffett  Wanted steak but not open in time because had a show to watch. Had to leave to eat at another place. Check in was great with mobile app. Cocktails hard to come by most of trip here.
50,My bride and I have been going to Vegas for many years. We love the Mirage and usually stay there. The location at mid-strip is central to everything we like the staff is friendly the rooms are clean & comfortable and we always get great deals. Many of the things we use/do at home to this day we discovered at the Mirage. We bought the down comforter and pillows for our bed at home (we always sleep SO good at Mirage) my bride uses the Moroccan shampoo & conditioner discovered at the Mirage gift shop and the pineapple mimosas are THE BOMB! If we have one complaint it’s the cigarette smoke on the casino floor. It always seems overwhelming even when it’s not crowded. We don’t smoke so we’re extra sensitive to it but would love more ventilation somehow. Regardless here’s hoping to another 20+ years of visits to the Mirage!
30,Hotel was okay. Location was perfect to see various sites. Hotel staff very friendly and helpful. Minor inconveniences occurred like remote not working. The staff resolved it immediately. Recommend this hotel in Vegas.
50,was great there treated very well all staff were great and friendly  Hated the Parking charge will diffently change our next stay  Enjoyed the room and hotel always good staying at Mirage  Again parking a draw back to staying
50,We are amazed when we first got inside the hotel in how everything is so unique and clean!  Stuff are very professional and friendly not to mention how safe we all felt with all the security service the Mirage have on floor!  We are definitely staying at the Mirage for future visits to Las Vegas!
50,Clean rooms friendly stuff. Great restaurants. The entire property is great. There is a great choice of food and other stuff to do. My family had a great time. We are already planning the next vacation to be at this place.
50,Hot tub was big. Nice hidden from sun . Loved the a lot machines dragon link food was good in snacks Huge sandwiches. Digital online checkin and digital keys were cool. My first time using that but could make plastic keys too
40,Carnige is gone. The famous pastrami sandwich.    Rooms need little service and updates.    Other than that all were good.    Did not try restaurants cause most were closed on Friday    Location is great if you want to take a little walk.
10,If you don't get a good room in this place do not expect to get a new room. Rather expect to be in the same place for the reservation. Worst experience ever. Also they aren't considerate if you get sick and you delay your departure by 40 odd minutes.
50,Just stayed three nights and it is by far one of the best MGM properties on the strip. Great location service price and atmosphere. Clean beautiful and welcoming. I hope it never goes away! Fourth time staying there.
50,Great service good gaming plenty of food services. I have stayed here many times and find this resort to very accommodating. Location is great for walking the strip. Convenient shopping and access to the Fashion Mall via tram to Treasure Island.
50,Only bad thing was that room was a little dirty. Shower sink and mirrors needed attention. The fridge was locked. Very friendly staff especially at Pantry restaurant. I would definitely come back and stay here again
40,Please update bathrooms immediately give us a Real shower with shower door better cable tv services Horrible reception my bed on the left side was sunk in because most guests watched tv on that side
40,Upon arrival bell staff quickly and efficiently stowed our luggage until check in and delivered to us in timely manner once we checked in. Check-in process was friendly and fast. This hotel has pretty much anything you could want. Friendly dealers and staff.    Bed was firm but not uncomfortably so. Could hear most people talking in conversational level outside in the hall as they walked past. Bathroom had a mildew smell.    Beware of the in-room consumables. The items are weight based which means you could be charged just for picking up an item ($17 for a large bottle of Fiji Water)
40,The check in was fine although the lady was a little pushy. I had to wait about 7 min just to check in. The room was adequate although it was a mile away from the elevator. The parking garage is too far. The food was excellent but expensive. I ate at the snacks place and my sandwich was really big and really good but it was 32$ for a sandwich fries and a drink. The Starbucks there is waay more than a normal Starbucks too. I didn’t win anything at all and my money went fast but after talking to some guy on the elevator I wasn’t the only one. We can to see David Spade and Ray Romano and the show was awesome!! Definitely highlight of the trip. Catch the volcano while you can because they’re getting rid of it next year :(
50,Great place to visit! Wonderful staff! The food was amazing! All the staff was wonderful and accommodating and easy to work with! All of the gaming was good!! A lot of different slot games!! Easy to find your way around!
50,My cousins and I usually come out every summer due to covid weve delayed and came out for 50th bday. I was disappointed in machines all 3 of us lost a lot. One of us will at least win some but not this time.
40,Although we didn’t receive the tower king room we initially booked the Mirage gave us a strip-view room with queen beds instead and a $200 food & drink credit as an apology. That’s a win for us! Would love to stay here again.
50,I really enjoyed this hotel and walking distance to other hotels. It has the dolphin and tiger exhibit and great restaurants. The room was very nice (not a great view but I didn't request one) and check-in was quick. The only issue was the distance from the parking garage to the elevators was a good hike but check your bags and it won't be an issue. I hadn't stayed here in 20 years or so and I'm happy it met my expectations again!
20,An outdated hotel with outdated hotel rooms staff were not too accommodating and not so friendly. Make sure you bring an ice chest because they don’t have one you can use in the room unless you rent one.
40,The best part of the room is the privilege of Staywell having a separate lobby line. The beds were great and the room felt comfortable and clean. The bathroom leaves MUCH to be desired. It really should be renovated. They dont provide any sort of soap other than shampoo during a global pandemic which is absurd to me. There was a huge glob of hair stuck on my tub drain.
50,Stayed at the Mirage for two nights. Had a fantastic view of the strip. Easy access to the hotel from the parking garage. Room was fantastic. Will definitely be back to visit the Mirage our next stay.
20,They didn’t have anybody to change broken things in the room asked staff to switch me to a different room they said they have no rooms available let me know this is a very slow time of year and I’m sure there were rooms available they need to maintain the hotel better
30,I have stayed at the Mirage eight times. This trip was my second post COVID. The casino staff was incredibly unfriendly. They are standoffish and not helpful. It reached the point where I just went elsewhere. I would not go back again for that reason. I don’t appreciate being treated as an inconvenience.
50,Rooms clean. Food good. Staff helpful. It's an older hotel but is still very nice and well kept. The rooms were big and clean. Had all the amenities that you need. Food at the two restaurants we ate at were great. Breakfast at The Pantry was wonderful.
10,Cheerleading competition nog enough staff. The staff that was there seemed upset food service in hotel was awful. There was a mask mandate and no one had their mask on. Requested to stay 2 hours later was told no renovations to the room was needed but other friends on the floor was all. I feel it was because we are African American
10,The rooms are very small the TV was maybe 32 inches the bed is uncomfortable the towels are threadbare and the the most horribly overpriced minibar I’ve ever experienced. This property is in desperate need of an overhaul.
50,We found the staff to be friendly helpful and welcoming. Every one was willing to help. The food was tasty. The ambience was welcoming. I would recommend your facility and staff to anyone. Thank you for creating an ambience 2nd to none!!!
50,Fantastic trip and excellent facilities. 10/10 would recommend. VIP services were incredible and this was truly a trip of a lifetime with the Mirage.    Absolutely gorgeous rooms and unbeatable customer service.
50,The Mirage is a very nice facility in a very convenient part of the strip. The casino is clean and the staff is friendly. Rumors have it the Mirage has been sold so hopefully it won't change. Investment groups tend to raise prices and cut back on services making the establishment fail.
50,Professional staff. Excellent room services/ housekeeping. I recommend this hotel. Nice atmosphere. I would stay again at mirage.  The only thing I couldn’t find was the Gym. I couldn’t find any signals related to that. But I didn’t asked. May be there are displayed but I didn’t perceive it. Overall was an excellent experience.
50,Stayed for a couple days to celebrate our engagement. My only complaint about this casino is the casino floor itself seems very small compared to some of the others. Slot selection feels limited but Caesar’s is so close that if you want to go there it’s actually within comfortable walking distance.
50,This hotel and casino is fabulous and close to everything. Conveniently located to shopping food and attractions. Very easy to get around from this location. The staff is very friendly and always willing to assist.
30,Stayed here two nights and paid way too much for a tiny room without a mini fridge. Room definitely needed updating. Only reason we stayed here was for a cheer competition that was being held in the convention center.
10,"I reserve an expensive ""Hospitality Suite"" during a Convention in Las Vegas. Believe it or not Mirage doesn't have the capability to assign the room number (which is important for corporate invitations) until you check in. This may be OK for tourist but is not nearly enough for corporate use (AND RATES!)."
50,Hard to believe that MGM could sell the Semiholes this perfect location on the strip instead of renovating and retooling.  One of few hotels to offer lots a true one bedroom suites to guests.  I think a lot of old time Vegas visitors will switch from MGM to Ceasars rewards.
50,We stayed at the Mirage 3 weeks ago in a comped room. From the moment that we walked onto the property it was great. They told us we had a free upgrade. The room was immaculate and a nice view of the strip. We were treated very well!
30,We attended for a cheer event hosted at this hotel and were disappointed with the disregard for hosting a very large number of guests under 21. There was nowhere for our team to gather when not competing. They were constantly chased out of the public areas if they stopped for a few seconds or chose to sit in line for the restaurants. I know people will say Vegas is an adult playground....but why host a kids cheer event without thinking of these things?    The hotel was OK but we've stayed at much better locations on the strip in the same price range. We will not be choosing the Mirage for future trips.
40,It is a great place to stay at with a lot of places around the hotel and within to ensure that you can always have a unique experience if you stay at the Mirage. The only downside is the parking you have to pay 15 a night even as a guest. If you do not mind this at all they will give a key card for in and out access to the lot.
30,Handicap room was terrible shower leak all over the floor. Room was not clean properly. Beer can under the bed. Paying for parking is ridiculous. Food prices were not very good for the value. Also the bartender at one of the places gave me somebody else's bill to pay and not my own. I even gave him my credit card Head my name on it so did the bill.
50,Excellent choice. We walked the strip and the hotel has everything you need for a great stay. The entertainment was amazing. The view from the room from a huge window that opens was so nice. I was able to take a picture of a beautiful sunrise.
50,Excellent service staff was very friendly I was never at one point lost in the casino! The valley staff were also friendly got my car speedy they took good care of my vehicle they were also very helpful on getting taxis I will highly recommend this place thank you for the stay in the hospitality
20,We have loved our stay in the Mirage Hotel and Casino before the pandemic. These days the Mirage Suite that we stayed in was dirty and not up to par with the standards of cleanliness that we are accustomed to when we stayed at the Mirage in the past. One noticeable thing is that when we stayed in a suite before we get two boxes of the shampoo lotion conditioner body wash. These days you get a bar of soap with cheap conditioner shampoo and lotion. I guess it's all about cutting on the services to get more PROFIT. It's more like Mirage cares more and more about money than satisfying customers. I was really disappointed with this stay.
50,Great place to stay! We stay here every year and we love it. We have no trouble at all getting to places we need to from here. Love the location!! The staff is extremely helpful and courteous. The slot machines pay out nicely as well.
10,"From check in to restaurants staff was aloof as if my business was totally inconsequential and in the only restaurant we went into only because we were too tired to go out the smoke from the lobby was a factor. Our food the bill was almost $400.00 for three of us was not worth the price. When I tried to bring this to the attention of one of our servers I was told to ""tell her"" and vaguely pointed to someone else not breaking stride.  Will NOT go back."
40,The location of the Mirage is excellent. So many activities within a very short walk. Hotel room was what is expected in Las Vegas but most importantly it was clean. We had no issues and experienced a pleasant stay.
20,This place has been sold to the Hard Rock corporation and it is evident everywhere that they’ve given up trying to be the classy place this once was. Tired rooms shops closed reduced restaurant hours $300 deposit “in case you trash the room! Insulting and I don’t want to stay where this is the clientele a hotel attracts…and it is!
50,Great host at desk. Friendly tips helpful suggestions for restaurant. Excellent Japanese restaurant. Clean room. Wish there was a coffeemaker and fridge. Nice bathroom great view. Nice comforter beds comfortable. Great stores convenience shop. Excellent valet service !
30,I expected a little more since I was staying at the Mirage. I had to change rooms as soon as I arrived the bathtub was stained yellow not where I would want to bathe. The second room was nice just a real hike to the elevators. Since we were there for a softball tournament I needed to take snacks for the athlete our room didn't have a mini fridge when I requested one they wanted to charge me $35/day. I wouldn't have minded paying it for my stay but per day would have been $175 I was there for five nights. I was also surprised there was no Kurig in the room I had to spend a small fortune at their coffee spot every morning. Only one jacuzzi was working when we went to use the one that was working there were 27 people in no thank you. For the amount of money that the hotel makes I would think that everything should be up and running. Overall I was very disappointed in my stay
40,Check in was easy. However we waited in line for a bit. I believe there was some type of cheer competition. The stay well room we reserved was great i loved the mirror in the bathroom so illuminating! only thing was the children running down the halls slamming doors. Also the frige was unable to be opened unless you put a credit card in file. Which wasnt displayed in the information upon reservation. Front desk staff were very nice.
50,I have been staying at the Mirage for almost 10 years. This year I have been there over 10 times alone to visit my daughter who attends UNLV. Every time I’m there I get great service! It’s a very easy casino to navigate through and the high limit room has great service too
20,I’ve stayed at The Mirage many times over the years and the location is A+. Other pluses of the hotel are a good sportsbook and the casino floor is large and has all the standard table games and all of the newest slots machines.    With that said the hotel is becoming really dated and in need of an upgrade. The bathroom in our room had a running toilet so it made a constant noise. We should of complained but just dealt with the issue by closing the bathroom door. We also had an issue with check in: the mobile check in app gave us a room that was not cleaned after the previous guest checked out. When I went downstairs to let them know we were given a dirty room the check in desk was very nice but very casual about it like it was a common issue to give people uncleaned rooms? It wasn’t a huge deal but it got our trip off to a bad start.
50,Clean and comfortable rooms and casino. Good room service. Friendly helpful staff. The restaurants don’t offer take out and have long waits on weekends. Monday only a few food options. Good slot options.
50,We go to Vegas five times a year and we love it! The Mirage is one of the favorite places that we stay at. We are part of the Total Rewards as well as the M life so we have many benefits to stay at many different properties for free most of the time!
30,Rooms need upgrading and remodeling. The bathtub drain was all rusted out and the drain stop was broke off. Broken tile in the bathroom. Boards around the beds are worn from hitting them with shoes. I probably won't stay here again unless the rooms are remodeled.
50,The Mirage has always been a special place for me - clean air friendly helpful staff who are always willing to help. Sports book is the best in town and the restaurants are superb. The location is the very best - within walking distance of many fun places.
30,We stayed here for the first time. The location is great centrally located in the middle of the strip. Great selection of games. The rooms were a bit outdated. Drinks/food seemed very highly priced even at look snack store.
50,The Hotel is very nice. Room is clean. You can’t even hear the noise outside your room. The hallway is very nice and clean. All the restaurants are great. The casino is clean. The staff are friendly and very helpful. Enjoyed our stay! We will comeback.
30,Was asked if CHEER competition was returning to MIrage the same weekend of NFR and was told NO. Sure enough friday here they come. Girls running down the hallways in the morning kids running wild in casino. My last stay at Mirage during the rodeo.
50,We were visiting for the NFR Rodeo and the great NFR parties that the Mirage's hosts after the Rodeo. During one of the night parties we met Andrea to obtain a MIRAGE Rodeo jackets info she gave us perfect instruction and I was able to make my purchase at the Mirage Cowboy Christmas booth.
50,My Wife and I have stayed at the Mirage twice now and we have enjoyed both of our stays. The resort and casino are very well maintained and the staff were very helpful and friendly. The location is perfect for us right in the middle of the strip within walking distance to many shops and restaurants. The free volcano show is a must see event for all ages.
50,The room rate was a great price. The facilities were beautiful. The staff was friendly. We had an enjoyable experience.we will recommend The Mirage to friends and gamily. We hope to return next year. Thanks
50,We had a great stay at the Mirage. It exceeded our wants and needs while in Vegas. Thanks to everyone at the Mirage for making our stay enjoyable. We came on a business trip but all the accommodations made this fun and memorable.
20,The hotel was in a great location however the A/C did not work in the room and there was a random sock in the room as well. The rooms are smaller than other hotel rooms on the strip. Its deff not as hype as other customers say.
30,I was dubious about staying at the mirage but it was right across from the conference I was in town for and I thought “I only need a bed and a shower”.    The room is actually ok a good size and seems clean. Getting to the room is a chore they queue for the lifts is crazy and then there is a maze of corridors to deal with.    The hallway is freezing- there is air conditioning blowing so hard it’s like walking in a gale! There is a big gap under the door so the room is freezing too. I requested extra blankets which they took to a different room - the air in the room is set to 85 but it hasn’t got any warmer.    The hotel is very busy. There are signs saying masks are mandatory but almost no one is wearing one and staff are not asking people to.    Everyone is smoking in the casino you have no choice but to walk through the casino to get to the lifts. I’m amazed smoking is allowed inside. Between Coronavirus and lung cancer I guess public health is not a concern!    The gym is tiny and open only from 8 am to 5 pm - so basically unusable. If you did find time in the middle of the day to go you’d be required to track through the main thoroughfare of the hotel in your gym kit.    At 3.40pm when I’d checked in and wanted a quick dinner before bed (jet-lag) basically none of the hotel restaurants were open. The one that was had no vegan options and a very long wait for a host to attend to a long queue of guests.    There is a huge resort fee so what looked like a very reasonable cost is actually quite expensive. I wish I’d stayed elsewhere.
50,Amanuel was exceptionally professional and great at his job for ensuring our stay was perfect. He went above and beyond to meet our needs and often checking in on our well being. We stayed 13 nights because our son competed in the rodeo. He made sure our lengthy stay was effortless on our part arranging everything possible. I will contacting Amanuel for our stay next year immediately
50,Met with family in Las Vegas for a long weekend during the rodeo. The Mirage was always busy with a lot of activities tied to the rodeo. Good food at the various restaurants and great entertainment. We really enjoyed the stay.
20,Hotel room bathroom was so rusty and broken drain and make up  mirror. Drain fixed but mirror was not. The room looked very worn out and not clean and kept. Very disappointing after all these years of staying there.
50,Enjoyed my stay as always. Small problem was handled well by staff. Just love being at the middle of everything and the restaurants are top notch here. Best steak in Vegas and can't wait to see what moves into the Rum Bar space.
30,The check in was fast easy and friendly. The casino was smokey but good. The room was clean and nice but there was a small comforter on the bed to use and that was all. No blankets avaiable without room service call. Beds were a little hard too. We were there during mask mandate and they were very strict on the tables but not as much playing slots. Restraunts were good.
30,For the cost of the hotel you certainly do not get any upgraded level of service by staff or management. Don't ask for directions or to correct a problem in their hotel as it will take a very persistant person to get anyones attention and action.
50,Love the location of the mirage. Easy access in and out of the parking garage if you have your own car. If walking around there is access to the Venetian across the street and others on the strip. Hotel is starting to show its age a bit but the rooms were very nice and the restaurants all look like they have been recently renovated.
10,Zero comps  Lost $2500 cash in casino horrible service  We used to love this place good drink food and gambling. Has totally went down hill. Can’t win anything. They have everything so tight. Nothing paying out. NO COMPS!!!
30,I can’t believe that they allow smoking on the casino floor but close down the buffets due to the pandemic. You can blow smoke along with your germs in the air nothing is safe about that. Yet you can’t stand in a buffet line to serve yourself food safely with a mask on.
50,We arrived the first evening and attended a complimentary dinner and drinks. The service was excellent.    The second evening we played a few slots and the staff was helpful and friendly.    Would definitely recommend the Mirage!
50,The Mirage was an amazing experience. The decorations were breath taking. Volcano show was an experience. Resort was clean room was quiet and staff if encountered were friendly. I would definitely recommend the Mirage.
40,Mirage is a nice hotel. Needs some updates to some of the rooms. Got stuck on the 5th floor staring at the top of the rest of the building. I did say no parking garage views so I mean I guess that counts. Maybe ;)
10,The room stank and wasn't clean. The sink didn't drain and the toilet barely worked. Obvious water damage on walls and the carpet was raised. The sink made a gurgling sound all the time even after it was supposedly fixed. Garbage on the roof in our view. Go to the Wynn very clean and magical this time of year.
50,As previously stated the overall stay was exceptional and I would highly recommend this property to others who are considering MGM properties as their choice of accommodations. Staff were great and the gambling experience was enjoyable.
50,This was our second time here and we were super pleased with our last stay so we expected nothing less. This visit we needed 2 rooms because we were here on bereavement and it turned out it was a busy weekend and the hotel was gouging prices but we stayed anyway because we knew the property. We had a nice stay. But I forgot my pillow and the hotel offerings are very high and overstuffed and quite lumpy.. so after a few hours I went to no pillow the gave up and watched the sunrise at 5am. So no sleep at 400 a night. Also be aware.. the mini bar i/countertop is touch sensitive so if you lift it you bought it..
50,Great location. Staff was friendly. Place was clean and you could see they keep up with the sanitizing. Room was good for our needs but didn't have a mini fridge so no place to store leftovers from one of their restaurants. People can smoke by the slot machines inside but it wasn't bad at all. We would stay here again.
30,Location is wonderful great places within walking distance. Staff very hdlpfil. Rooms were very small and bathroom in room was very small and seemed outdated compared to many other Mgm properties on the strip.
40,Check in took way too long even when the rooms were paid for in advance and others will getting rooms quickly. Took us 5 hours. AC didn't work in the room even after they came to fix it when we were gone. Even contacted the front desk and it was not solved completely. Said they would give us a credit but it was not.
50,Always a pleasure to stay at an Mgm resort! Staff was friendly & the rooms were clean! No complaints. Checking in and checking Out on the app was a breeze. 10/10 definitely will be returning. Thanks again!
10,If your a minority don't even think about staying here. I was treated poorly and felt out of place everywhere I went. RACIST STAFF! Hotel rooms are old and dirty. They placed us in the far end of the hotel just made an extra inconvenience. Can't believe I spent money at this place...
40,The Mirage is still holding up well after many years. Rooms and rest of the property are clean and well maintained. I like staying here because it's reasonably priced and centrally located on the the strip.
30,Rooms need updating no drink service buffet closed masks had to be worn even though we were both fully vaccinated  super long wait at restaurants that were open-not all open not enough video poker machines
40,Have I stayed at nicer resorts in Las Vegas? Yes. But something about the Mirage keeps drawing me back. Part of it is guest services especially the front desk. They treat you like they are truly excited for you to be there. They are super attentive and make sure the check-in line keeps moving. And I've arrived early as 11AM and they never try to charge me for early check-in. I got a room with a strip view even though I didn't request it originally. Even the baggage check guy remembered me when I picked up my bags.    The place still feels classy. I like the layout of the rooms although it is time for a remodel of the bathrooms.    They have a nice variety of restaurants and the location on the Strip is hard to beat.
40,Started out bad but got a whole lot better. Room was not ready when we arrived. Waited 2.5 hrs for room. Still not ready. About to ask for my money back when a new upgraded room was given and meal voucher. New room was real nice.
20,We were on the 20th floor and the water pipes knocked incessantly. It disturbed our sleep. We did get a restaurant credit but that really didn’t help our problem. The front desk said they were working on this so I’m hoping that future travelers don’t have to deal with this.
50,"We received a slot tournament invitation and thought ""heck why not we have never been to one before lets give it a shot."" It was so worht it! It was great to get away from the midwest chill of Nov and believe it or not we did sit out at the pool twice and went in the pools. It was wonderful. We had a standard room which was still very nice and clean. Staff was all wonderful. Mlife was great and comped majority of not only our room but dining etc too. Went to prime at bellagio and was to die for dover sole and filet were impeccable to say the least. Went to toms urban at ny ny and that was wonderful too. Cannot wait to return in Jan for husbands birthday."
50,Rooms are large very quiet and the room service was excellent. In the meeting areas service was very good. Sound quality was not up to par in the largest meeting rooms; otherwise good place for business meetings
20,We had reserved a suite month in advance of our trip but when we arrived they told us our room wasn’t available and moved us to a handicap room. The shower was much too low for us and the room was dirty. We still had a great time in the premises but hard when you start off finding they didn’t really reserve the room for you.
50,Took a last minute trip to the NFR room was very fresh and clean staff was very friendly casino was good. Great place to watch the NFR with live feeds on large screens live entertainment nightly and a great crowd.
50,Anniversary anniversary/Halloween giveaway that’s fine can’t wait to stay again Well we’re playing and they were very helpful when I had to stay two extra days prices were fair would definitely say again
40,The Mirage is well-positioned for easy access to all the Strip has to offer. It's not the most luxurious casino and hotel and is a little long-in-the-tooth compared to others on the Strip but the rooms are comfortable the beds are awesome (I would've taken it home with me if I could) the staff is professional and friendly and it has the classic Vegas charm you'd expect in a storied old casino especially for the price if you book well enough in advance. Recommended.
30,Although the hotel was clean and the staff were friendly and helpful it was disappointing that the fitness center is only available from 8 - 5. If you're attending a conference don't expect to work out. The fitness area is located in the spa so it's only available during spa hours.
50,Nice hotel great helpful staff!! This was our first time in Las Vegas overall good experience and felt safe despite the ongoing pandemic. Good to see the staff enforce mask wearing. We will plan to stay there again.
50,Great friendly staff room was clean and comfortable. Easy access to everything. Well stocked mini bar. Great food available without leaving the casino. There was a great nightly show out in front of the entrance.
10,"Very transactional service lacking essential requirements for what is claimed to be a ""4 star"" hotel.    I was given room on the 19th floor even though the staff was well aware that a construction is going above.    The management also decided to maximize the profits by taking over the room refrigerator and making it a weight based vending machine - instead of a welcome I received a warning - be careful around the fridge else you will be charged even if you didn't consume anything!"
40,staff was excellent and very polite and professional. the room was clean but is showing it's age as the stopper in the bath tub did not work and it was rusty. I also noticed that there was a shortage of cocktail servers so I went across the street to a ceasers property to get service
50,Great hotel service view. We stayed in the volcanic view rom. It was just beautiful view. We will be returning with the family in March and wanted a central spot on the strip. Could nor be more pleased wit the Mirage.
40,Location is great with everything I want close by. Walgreens Fat Tuesday The Forum Shoppes. Plenty of great food especially Snacks! Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat are a delight. Rooms are a little worn.
50,Definitely one of if not the best hotel on the strip great location great restaurants excellent service super clean and the best entertainment. I would definitely love to come back real soon 🎰🎰
40,Everthing was nice and very clean. Got to see a private dolphin show which was very cool. Played some blackjack and enjoy the free drinks. I really did enjoy my stay at The Mirage. I would for sure stay here again.
50,Just love to stay there eat and play cards. Everyone is so nice. Also this is the only casino that gave me money for food and to play. Made me very happy! I would love to stay there more often. Love the Mirage.
50,What a great experience at the Mirage! Slots were friendly as well as the staff. Spa was AMAZING!!!! Not just the massage but the steam room after. Didn’t dine there due to previous reservations. Going back for Christmas.
50,We had wonderful stay at Mirage staff was great and rooms and hallways smelled so great which I never experienced before. Nice food joints restaurants right across along with Walgreens. I would say it is best hotel for me considering location and budget
40,Stayed here during the NFR. Great atmosphere in the casino and the After-Party entertainment is free! Centrally located on the strip. Have stayed at the Mirage more than any other casino in Las Vegas. Will stay again!
50,From start-to-finish my trip was great and the room met all my expectations as a business traveler.  The Mirage was also located close to the places I worked at during the week it was very convenient to take a rideshare from the same place as taxis and other pickup/dropoff options. Not all hotels place pickups at the same spot so that was good for me.
20,I had the worst check in service ever! Be prepared that check in is at 3pm and the staff is not very helpful. Also it took 57 min to receive our luggage so by the time you are all up in the room its about 5pm. Wish I booked somewhere else.
30,Good hotel beds are old. I've stayed at TI next door not as nice hotel but beds are better. Hotel was quiet though casino was busy. soap and shampoo ok. checkout via TV which was fast and easy. Was at re:invent conference was a good location.
50,Overall a great experience. Very accommodating. Great rates and reasonable late check out fee. Perfect location on the strip. I will definitely stay again and highly recommend to anyone visiting Las Vegas.
50,Love staying here it’s my second time after sema and I cannot complain  awesome food inside  great casino for fun  and awesome view on the strip. I also loved the scenery inside with the holiday decorations
50,We checked in super early and was pleasantly surprised that we got a room by 10:30 am. A pillow case seemed to have a stain (maybe blood) and immediately the room attendant switched it out for us and was very friendly. Every morning the room attendant would check to see if I was ready for service as I was leaving my room. Never bothering me while inside. Room was always clean and never had any issues.
10,The room and carpet was damp. Strong odor of mold which we found on walls of the bathroom. NEVER during the 5 contacts we had with front desk and housekeeping would a manager talk to us. housekeeping said he sprayed the room 5 times that day with cucumber deodorizer. Thank goodness for his honesty!!
10,We encountered many issues which were never resolved. The staff had my wife crying in the lobby the morning after we checked in which happened to be our 15th anniversary. We will not be returning to the Mirage in the future.
50,Great help with Mlife booking the room ahead of time. Check-in was smooth. The room was amazing as it was our daughters 21st birthday on November 30th. Weather was great so made our pool experience was fantastic. Food in all venues was great.
10,My fur coat was stolen out of the closet. I had to file an investigative report with security two days ago and still haven't heard anything. UNACCEPTABLE. Be careful with valuable items!!! Never staying here again.
30,Booked two rooms traveling with family. Switched twice and still didn’t get rooms we booked on same floor. Key card won’t let you access other floors. Asian restaurant was awesome. Gaming was great but the room elevators were only accessible through the gaming floor.
50,Much needed fun time from the everyday routine of things....!! Great staff and cocktail bars. Didn’t win a fortune but had a great time! So very clean and comfortable. The Mirage will be my choice again!
40,we hadn't stayed at the Mirage in a long time and to our surprise it was awesome! nice clean rooms friendly staff great restaurants. Conveniently located and easy to park and get too. Casino was clean and had a lot of games we both liked we would recommend the Mirage to anyone wanting a great Vegas experience!
50,Awesome room stays quiet and awesome view. All of the staff was friendly and the restaurants were delicious. It’s Very clean and a close walk to all the fun hotels. would definitely stay here again!!
40,The Mirage is a beautiful property conveniently located in the heart of the strip. Easy access to the freeways and walking distance to many of the attractions in the area. Rooms feel a little dated and valet is a nightmare since they no longer have their own employees but hired an outside company. The downside of MGM Properties you pay for parking and valet....They've lost the essence and appeal of the hospitality of Las Vegas with this move.
20,I booked and accessible room due to recent knee surgery. BIG mistake! The room was filthy it did not have an accessible shower zero counter top space no table or desk area and smelled awful! I reported to the front desk and they apologized but that was all. My next stay was already booked at The Mirage for Dec but will be staying elsewhere in 2022! The Mirage is in a great location. The Snack has awesome food and great service.
30,Stayed here for the 2021 NFR. Rooms pretty outdated for the price didn’t even have a clock in the room. View from room was the roof which was littered with trash. Everything in the casino seemed to be priced exceptionally high (even for Vegas). Not much to do at the mirage other than a few bars. Overall I wont be staying here again and wouldn’t recommend.
40,Overall hotel was great. Easy check in. We did everything through moble app digital keys online check in etc We paid extra for volcano view but only had a partial view. Others in our party did not pay extra but had a better view than we did.
10,Very pretty hotel until you get to your room! Got married here in front of the Volcano and it was amazing but we should have stayed somewhere else. Not worth the money. Bed was super comfy. Don't take your shoes off! YUCK.
40,Stayed here for the Grand Tasting for Wine Spectator. Room was comfortable and in pretty good condition considering the constant churn of people in Vegas. Bed was comfortable and the room was clean. Staff was helpful. Ballrooms for the wine tasting were clean and well kept. Food for the buffet during the tasting was very good. Plenty of room and spacing for having an event during COVID. Got a good price off of Hotwire which probably helps my view of the place from a value question.
10,while we stayed at the mirage everything was just OK nothing big. that was until the last night where my sibling punctured her toe on a part of the carpet. turns out the previous guests tore a small part of the carpet and found nails sticking out of the floor. we immediately called front desk and they sent up a medic. not only did this ruin our night but also our trip. we filed an incident report and now 5 months later have heard no response. NEVER SHOULD A GUEST BE INJURED BY BLATANT LACK OF MAINTEANCE. I am more upset that the staff has made no effort to fix the situation since I love mgm locations
20,We were told our confirmed Tower King Room was sold out - reservation made two months prior - someone else was upgraded to our room - we were downgraded to a 2 queen room with a view of the roof that was covered with garbage. The staff was not concerned in the least bit - so I'm thinking this happens quite often - sad because the property is nice and has an old school feel but lacking in customer service.
20,Our room wasnt ready when they told us it would be.  We didnt get a strip view we paid additional for  There was mold in our shower ceilings 17-119  We were moved to 14-095. Still didnt get strip view  Keys didnt work.  Bell Staff couldnt move our bags for us.  14-095 had ripped curtins made us feel like we were in a trailer park.  It diffinately didnt help my wifes birthday party atmosphere.
20,I travel to Vegas often and this would be the worse experience would not recommend Mirage to anyone.    Packed and not one restaurant can accommodate two people for diner at 630pm. No later time given they just say you have to try another day.
20,Black mold in the ceiling above the shower. Black stuff on towels. It appeared that something spilled down the front of the night stand and never got cleaned up. Overall very disappointed staying here.
50,The hotel was clean and well maintained. The only bad thing I could say is that the hotel is somewhat outdated. Could use a refresh in the rooms. The location is really good as you can get anywhere from the center point.
50,One of the best hotels I have ever stayed. Rooms are big and clean. Beds and furniture are new. A lot of things to do in the hotel. Pool shopping cafes bars restaurants…Hotel location is great close to many attractions and convention centers. Casino and restaurants are the best!
50,stayed at the mirage for a friends birthday. the room key on the phone was very useful. loved the people at the hotel. very friendly. when we went across the street to the linq (hope thats how you spell it) hotel we didnt have the same experience with the casino staff. they were very bossy and made it seem like we were not welcome. Me and my friends did not have the same experience at the mirage. will be back in March for sure.
50,My wife and me were in Mirage Hotel for two nights and there days for our 29th wedding anniversary that our two boys were booking for us  it was very nice excellent memory for but of us and we hope could come back again.
20,I like the Mirage and its location and generally I have had a good experience. This stay the room stank of smoke. I called down and they said it was a no smoking room and to open the window. I did this and later in the day when I returned it still stunk. I spoke to front desk again and they said they would put a machine in my room. I have no idea if they ever did this but the smell never went and they never offered to change the room. Disapointing. In Vegas all non-smoking rooms should have smoke alarms which cannot be turned off. If you say its a non-smoking room you need to guarantee that it does not smell of smoke!!
30,Our room was very old and outdated. MGM Mirage needs to make an investment in this property and upgrade the rooms. We may change venues and try out a Caesars property. This was a disappointing stay for us and we typically stay at MGM properties.
50,"The room was spacious and very clean. All staff members were friendly and courteous. Anytime we had questions they were helpful and knowledgeable of the information. I would have preferred the bed be a bit softer but I did get a good night sleep. I would definately stay there again especial in the ""Stay Well"" rooms."
10,Do not stay here. Room had mold on the ceiling and smelled like smoke. Stained carpet and the wifi didn’t work. Gross experience. The front desk guy was nice but it was his first day and he was clueless.
40,"Only my wife and buddy gamble so I spend most of my time in the room reading or watching TV. The suite is nice for me but my wife didn't feel a ""good vibe"" in the casino; both from the floor itself and the dealers."
50,Great location restaurants and fun games. Location is close the other places like McDonald’s Walgreens and an Outback.  Also not a far walk to the casino from the strip. The smell inside is awesome!!
50,Beautiful hotel very nice staff. Casino never felt overly crowded like some of the other casinos. The still was a nice sports bar and the staff working there were great. The view was great including being able to watch the volcano go off 24 stories up.
20,Looks like Lady Luck was not on my side this time. Next time you take an email offer from the Mirage ask them if you’ll be placed on a floor with construction happening on the floor above you. With contactless check in you’ll get no notice about the issue and get woken up at 9am every morning to the sounds of hammering and drilling. The sounds so crystal clear that you can hear every time a screw is dropped on the floor. Enjoy that for 4 days only to call and have no room available to move to. Sure they did their best to accommodate but my question is why put people on that floor in the first place?
40,Very nice place to stay for AWS re:Invent. The music played in the casino changed to country/western when then rodeo people showed. Nice way for the hotel to accommodate the musical taste of their guests. Only issue I had was the sound made by nearby room locks was loud enough to wake me up on e during my stay. I plan to stay again.
30,Gym opens at 8 am making it inconvenient for folks to workout before their day starts.    Room was not cleaned properly during our stay.  Refrigerator was filled to the brim with drinks and not leaving space to put any of my stuff. Said that I would be charged automatically if I removed a drink and put it back.    Casino was fine.
20,We’re there before check in time and they told us a room is not ready yet.We have to wait for over 2 hours to get our room.Also when we get in or out from hotel parking lots a key card not working at all.
30,Ideal location. The one side of our room darkening curtain was broken. House Keeping kept forgetting to take dirty glasses out of the room. The hotel and casino were clean. There was no room in our refrigerator to put leftovers and if you removed a beverage you were automatically charged so we could not fit anything in there. Not as many stores and restaurants in the hotel as we would have liked.
20,Room is too old and we got dirty towels (even makeup on it) and the sheet make my feel itchy. We ask for toothbrush and slippers and it comes to us after 4 hours waiting and slippers are ran out so we couldn't get one. Never again.
40,The stay was great the machines were not good on payouts but the rooms were nice. Be cautious that if you need to go anywhere Valet was an hour wait for our vehicle and noticeably upset guests around us. A lady waited 1 hour and 20 minutes for her vehicle and was told 3 times...we will get to it when we do. Not good customer service. Not sure if they were low on staff so they maybe agitated.
50,The Mirage has been our hotel to stay since 2014 and we enjoy it every time. The service from the front all the way to house keeping the cleanliness and I just love the smell at the entrance. I think that's what has captivated me.
50,Nice to be back in Las Vegas Mirage was very nice rooms were spacious health club very good clean and stafff very helpful  Check in and char know out online was very easy and hassle free  Bathrooms dated and need face lift  Overall very good accommodations for purpose of trip
40,All was great besides the non functioning drain in the tub/shower other than that it was a fantastic hospitable stay. Thank you to the friendly staff at the mirage will definitely be coming back soon.
50,We stayed here for vacation on Thanksgiving. We had a wonderful time there and the rooms were very clean. Our favorite place to eat there was the sushi place and the food was delicious. The housekeeping ladies were also really kind and sweet.
30,First I will say we knew going into this stay that Mirage may have some issues due to it being one of the oldest mega resorts on the strip. When we got to the hotel and checked into the suite on the 26th floor (A) we noticed the bar area sink was stopped up. Maintenance was called and bar sink was plunged. Because the lines connect with the bathroom bidet the pressure caused fecal material and toilet waste to spray all over the bathroom walls and floor. It stunk so bad. In the midst of getting ready for dinner reservations at Otoro before Beatles Love show this happens…we decided to leave maintenance in the room so we could make our 7pm dinner reservations before the 9:30 show. We asked maintenance to please make sure the bathroom was cleaned before we got back which he said he would “take care of it”. An hour and a half later we returned to the room…maintenance is gone the bar sink drains very slowly now and the bathroom is still a disgusting mess. Called down to have housekeeping sent up to clean and to speak with maintenance. Bless housekeeping for cleaning it all up. Maintenance on the other hand said they would need to snake the line in the morning from the floor above our suite. Okie dokie nothing we can do about it since we had a show to see and a line to stand in by 9pm to get into the venue. However the bathroom smelled aweful all night and the smell did not clear up until they snaked the line the next day. We had close the bathroom door and leave the fan on all night and use lots of poopourri. We made it to Beatles Love for the 9:30 show. We decided to finish the last 3 days of our trip at Mirage so we could see Beatles Love and be in the area for our Thanksgiving reservations at Bacchanal Buffet (literally a 12 minute walk from our mirage suite). If I knew we would be dealing with this mess I probably would not have stayed at this hotel. Having come from the Waldorf Astoria prior to hopping over to Mirage it was like night and day. In addition the elevators make this weird clanging sound and you can audibly hear the breaks squeaking at every stop. It was kind of scary coming down from the 26th floor early in the mornings. I will say the high limit slot room is very chill especially in the mornings and earlier in the day. However the selection of machines isn’t that many if your looking for the newer ones. The casino floor does get a little crowded later on in the evening and into the night. The main draw to this hotel is the location.
50,Enjoyed every Moment of my Vegas Trip. Staff were Great. Gayle Johnson from Spa Salon will be my forever friend. Thanks Scott Poster Marketing Exec for coming to my Machine and adding me to Your list of Players. Ester Pulido housekeeping Supervisor and Norma Graciano for making my stay great.
40,The Mirage Hotel & Casino was very nice and clean. the staff was always friendly.  the variety if restaurants was awesome but very expensive. The rooms were clean but due to age of hotel not up to date with today's technology such as USB charging. overall the experience was great and i would stay there again.
50,"Very nice stay. Housekeeping was awesome; great sense of ""security"" with the housekeeping. I came back into room while she was cleaning to retrieve something and she stopped me dead in my tracks to make sure I had a key to the room. She gets a 10+!!"
40,Rooms were clean employees were very helpful. Not enough affordable places to eat. Casino was very tight. The video poker section was very dark and depressing. Hopefully the new owners will brighten up the place.
50,We have been to Vegas several times and normally stay in a Caesar's hotel. This was our first stay at the Mirage and we were very pleased. It was a smooth check in the room was clean bed very comfortable casino layout was great several food options. We will definitely be booking our next trip at the Mirage!
50,Love staying at this hotel/casino in Las Vegas. Great location and many good restaurants available for dining. Stayed in a two-bedroom suite this time. Lots of room and very comfortable and clean. Will definitely be back.
40,Enjoyed this clean and friendly casino. Love lol the fresh plants and garden feel. The room was spacious and clean easy to move around with mobility device. Enjoyed great meals in the casino as well.
40,The first thing that hits you is the smell of the pina colada air freshener... yet you can't get a pina colada anywhere... you should be capitalizing on this! The 2nd thing is the beautiful fish tank and decor of the atrium. Still so classy and beautiful. Diana at the front desk was excellent she assisted me in all our needs and answered all our questions. We had a staywell ADA compliant room this trip and the room was great although the carpets definitely need shampooing as my slippers were black by the end of the trip. Room 12002.... clean the carpets please! Rooms are starting to be dated most noticeable is the lock of USB ports. At least replace the lamps with ones that have extra outlets/usb ports. Luckily I had brought my own powerstrip because I knew this was an issue in advance by reading the reviews. All in all I would stay again and recommend it to others. But it is time to address the issues MGM. Maybe that's why you are trying to sell it?
50,Hotel was nice very VEGAS! Great food and good show Tim Allen. Staff was very help full. Very nice when they asked you to put on your mask if you had forgotten. Had some good shops for knick knacks. Enjoyed being in the middle of everything.
50,I heard about this hotel thru a mutual friend. I was apprehensive about staying but once I arrived I was very very impressed with the attentiveness of your staff and the cleanliness of the hotel and the sincere compassion that was shown. The place is definitely a hidden gem for sure.
50,Easy to get around clean good food stayed there many times nice friendly people best location has a California pizza kitchen steakhouse not a huge casino easy check in. Convenient to other casinos love it
50,Very accommodating had an exceptional great time!! Food was great didn’t encounter any difficulties what so ever. Every employee we dealt with were great people very accommodating and were looking out for our best interests as guests. From the time we entered the property till the time we left we were treated like honored guests!! Had a great time very much enjoyed the casino shows we attended as well as the ease of navigation throughout the property. Room was spotless and remained that way during our stay. Had the best time ever!  Thank you management you have one hell of a staff!!!!
50,As always great service. Good food. Very busy. Clean rooms. Handicap accessible. Sports bar service excellent. Slots were okay too. I actually won. Covid measures were excellent. Did not feel compromised. New key for elevator use added extra security
50,The facilities were clean the staff was pleasant and helpful. There were four couples on this trip. The men participated in a four day golf tournament. The Mirage is near great options for eating and shopping. The casino staff was friendly and courteous.
50,The hotel was wonderful clean and Staff was very courteous. Lots of nice dining options. Close to alot of main casinos/hotels. We loved they had the Exotic Animal garden and the Nightly Volcano show
50,Enjoyed my night at the Mirage Hotel! Definitely will book there again! Super clean and classy. Love that the casino wasn’t huge. The restaurant there was great especially the breakfast. Can’t wait to be back!
40,It was really nice. We booked a stay well room but when down stairs got really smoke it would start smelling the room up. Everyone friendly and helpful. Loved the food choices but long wait times. Also took a while to get a cab.
50,We had a fantastic time. Staff treated us well. Sad there's no coffee in the rooms but quickly figured out it is best to order Starbucks on app to pick up. Love was great! Center lounge was awesome with fantastic one man band.
50,The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I will definitely book where again. The hotel was very clean and neat. We had an excellent time here. The housekeeping staff did a great job and they always spoke whenever they would see you in passing.
50,This was the first time we stayed at the Mirage. We have vacationed in Vegas 3 times. We have never had a room with such a level of cleanliness. The location on the strip is great. The casino restaurants were great! Overall this was the best place we have stayed in Vegas.
50,Mirage hotel staff was excellent and accommodated our large party. The front desk staff even found connecting rooms for us which was great since we had a party of 18 in a total of 8 rooms. We couldn't ask for a better experience for our family trip during Thanksgiving! I would highly recommend this hotel as there are kid friendly events located right inside the hotel. The hotel was updated and clean and we did not have any issues the entire trip.
10,Can't say I enjoyed my stay here. I got a hard charge on my card for a major security deposit that I still haven't been refunded on. I was told it would be a soft charge & fall off. Furthermore I was put in the wrong room and charged $18 for a single bottle of water. The room wasn't very clean. The noise from the hallways was unacceptable. The staff also didn't know where things were throughout the resort.
50,First time stay at the Mirage. It was one of our best stays in Vegas. Have been going there for about 30 years for Thanksgiving. except for last year. Love being in middle of the Strip. Variety of slots was great. Loved Osteria Costa Restaurant. We ate there 3 nights. Meatballs and pasta - a must try. Rooms were clean and up to date.
50,Great customer service and easy check in. Location close to the strip and easy to get from one destination to other. Very close to all the festivities.Food was great as well. I would recommend this hotel to friends and family.
50,This was our first time in Vegas and The Mirage was a great choice. Location was perfect. Volcano show was amazing. Staff was friendly and willing to help. Loved the show that was right on site and all the food choices.
10,explained in previous comments about the garage resort hotel. please try to understand ur guests requirements and meet their needs. if kids are there please take care of them. dont try to earn money all the time
20,"We booked our trip ahead of time as any normal person does and went through all the billing etc before booking and were ok with the price. Then we get to check-in and they automatically charge you $150/person ""resort fee""! Just for being there! I asked what was included with that they said ""access to our resort"" - HA!!! So what you forgot to charge us the first time we paid to stay at your resort? Absurd. Not sure if other resorts in Vegas are doing this but we will be staying away from any that are."
30,Room was as expected. No more no less. It was a room. Ice machine never had “hard” ice always watery. Watch out for bathroom. Has changed drastically since the last time I was hear and not for the better. Location is good staff is fine.
10,Would definitely pick any other resort over MIRAGE I know people disregard this because there are so many other reviews out there. I did the same I ignored the 1 2 and 3 star reviews thinking its MGM resorts MGM does take it seriously. Hopefully someone from management would take this seriously. The overall experience was spoiled for few bad fishes out there at resort who probably didn't care
50,Our recent birthday stay was exceptional from the front desk concierge cleanliness of the rooms dining room services and the casino.  Some of our party members were first timers and were thankful how easy it was to navigate throughout the hotel shopping and casino. We all were impressed with the quality of slots card tables and payouts.  We had a fabulous time we only regret not staying longer.
50,Beautiful hotel the waterfalls near the entrance and pool is breathtakingly beautiful. They offer a variety for dinner options all where awesome. We saw Shin Lim here as well his slide of hand makes you think that he’s actually magic.
50,We arrived late at night and brought a lot of stuff with us. The check-in using the app really helped us not to line-up anymore. The use of digital key worked best the directions towards the room was easy to understand. We had enought rest for that night!
10,I was born in Vegas and remember when the Mirage first opened it doors. The palm trees and the volcano. It was....wow! Now it is more like the Motel 8 with a show in its courtyard. The staff doesn't know anything and will tell you whatever they need to tell you so you'll go away. The whole place smells like smoke. Rooms are dated and there are so many hidden costs to staying there. Look for a hotel that MGM doesn't own which might be tough because they own pretty much everything.
10,Second stay at Mirage. Went with my mom. Woke up second morning to find a bed bug on my bed. Called and spoke to manager. He had me moved to another room promptly. Called me after I checked out to inform me they had previous room I complained about checked. They found nothing. I know what I saw. I also understand this might have been a isolated incident just crappy and unacceptable on what I was sleeping on. Also second attempt at giving Mirage a try.
50,The mirage hotel and casino resort is one of the better casinos and hotels I’ve been to on this trip they have great events like the Siegfried and Roy and dolphin habitat also big smoke Vegas is held there and I go every year
50,Mirage never disappoints - it is always a guaranteed fun time. The shows rock the food is amazing - the dolphins and tigers are an added bonus. It is easy to move around and you will want to go back over and over
50,We had always wanted to go and we were not disappointed.. The strip is a marvelous place to visit.. So many sites and places to visit... Be prepared to walk though... We racked up around 29k steps each day but all well worth it..
50,Check inn easy and very nice staff room well cleaned casino host very good hallway at all casino tables are on fire high limit slots same a s the MGM Grand very nice i really hope the new owners just keep having this property very good same as MGM does
30,Hotel is good rooms are nice. A little dated and need better cleaning but decent for Las Vegas level quality. My complaint is that MGM (owners) sold my email and cell phone data the day I signed up for the cell phone app. I have spammed none stop since their app downloading and signing up. Note that the hotel has smoking in the lobby so be prepared. they do a decent job of air circulation but it is always a surprise to see smoking indoors.
50,This was my first time staying at the Mirage and it was a fantastic experience. I stayed 11/23 - 11/26. The holiday decor was adorable and the casino was large but not overwhelming.    I booked the Mirage Suite and loved it. The suites came with a double door access and a beautiful long foyer into the room. The room itself was incredibly spacious with clean modern lines and a great use of muted colors. The two bathrooms were great (a MASSIVE soaking tub in one a wonderful. standing shower in the other) with two closets storage. The storage was plentiful and the bed was incredibly comfortable. The living section was fantastic and it really allowed me to truly relax in the room. If you can spending a little more for the Mirage Suite is definitely worth it.    The Mirage is definitely a premiere 4-star hotel and I can't wait to return.
30,While we had an overall enjoyable trip in Vegas the Mirage seems to have lost some of its Magic. The Mirage was the first property I stayed at in Vegas about 8 years ago. I have stayed multiple trips since. The Mirage has certainly seen a decline in the past two years. Some of the service issues I can understand due to staffing issues caused by the pandemic. However the quality of the resort seems to be going downhill. While toiletries were provided they were all different brands and low quality. This may be a sign of the rumor of a sale of the resort. The MLife desk was not helpful in remedying the issue I encountered using a player communications rep to switch my booking from another MLife property and marching the comps. The atmosphere was lively and the table game dealers were friendly and fun as always. This may have been my last stay at The Mirage.
10,Bad and strong humidity smell made me sneeze all night runny nose watery eyes. The next day my nose was still congested and my eyes were itchy. I Could not go to sleep because of how uncomfortable I was.
50,Booked room to stay as we were here to see Bill Maher on 11/27/2021. Also attended The Beatles Love Cirque Du Soleil on the 11/26/2021 Friday night.Great time. Magnificent facility would love to come back on the future.
10,Upgrade your restrooms. Doorknob gets stuck and the shower handle was very loose. It was hard to get the water where I wanted. Instead of just hurrying up cleaning and checking in other guests do a a quality check in your rooms.
30,"I was excited when my business trip and convention invited me to stay on site. I was interested to see how well our design had survived in the last 14 years. The irony is it is exactly the same in the guest tower. The casegoods all topped n glass were in pristine condition. The design was fresh and thematic without hitting you in the face then. Now sadly with the smoky residue in every cubic corner of the building  it makes the textiles seem just that much older because they smell. Granted we are coming out of a pandemic and most other properties took 2020 and updated or renovated. The original ""Y"" - shaped tower corridors is a brilliant way to get 3000 rooms on very long hallways over 29 stories but older guests [myself included] should ask for rooms near the tower center.  Even with thoughtful signage guest get confused. I was awakened two nights in a row by disoriented and likely inebriated guests lost getting to their rooms.  By contrast the casino level and amenities appear fresh - a sign that something is working on this iconic property. If you've never stayed here this is a property that has a lot to offer but it is long overdue for an overhaul in the guest tower. Typical baths are cramped and should have more showers than tubs.  Every one of the 50+ people in my group had similar experiences and observations. It's time to refresh this mature Mirage."
30,Overall my experience was good but with a few complaints. The atmosphere and cleanliness was exceptional and I slept like a baby every night. When visiting the Cashier or Sportsbook I often felt rushed or that I was given an attitude as if I didn’t know what I was doing. I played Blackjack for an hour without a waitress in sight to the point where other players complained and our dealer asked the pit boss for one. I ended up busting out without a single drink. The guest rooms are equipped with a highly sensitive mini bar where if you even pick up an item or take anything out of the fridge they charge you for it based on weight. I would have spent way more on food and drinks if they instead had an empty fridge and microwave for them. I understand it was Thanksgiving weekend but I definitely expected better customer service for a higher quality location.
50,Location is great staff is awesome casino is lively…just a great choice for a Vegas trip! It’s easy to visit multiple spots or stay at The Mirage. I was impressed by the dealers and other hospitality staff. Highly recommended!
50,We had a good time at the Mirage. Good slot machines and good food. The casino was welcoming and the tables were on fire. We enjoyed the inside bars and the DJ at the bar. STILL restaurant was awesome. The breakfast and dinner staff were wonderful.
50,Great hotel with friendly staff and clean from the parking structure to the room. Great atmosphere well worth the stay. Did not have any issues at all ans the staff was helpful and accommodating our needs.
30,We had a last minute trip we chose the volcano view king room. In our opinion it was not worth the extra you don't get a great view better from the road. The room was old with a chipped bath and wall paper peeling in the bedroom area. On a positive note the bed was very comfortable.
30,Nice experience. Rooms were clean.  Ate at 4 locations in hotel with satisfaction at each. The pantry stacks Still and the coffee place along with Starbucks.  Basically the only negative was the amount of smoke especially when dining.
50,This hotel is always a good choice if you’re having trouble deciding on which one to pick! I’ve been coming here with my family for years and I now stay here when I come friends. Hopefully I get to continue staying for years to come! :)
40,Clean large rooms  very large property with all the COVID restrictions they do there very best to maintain some type of normalcy . The staff and stay where top notch thank you for your hard work and continued MGM quality
10,Don’t waste your time or money. Not accommodating at all. Be aware of the hidden cost. Very unkept and dirty. Been to Vegas many times never have I left feeling so dirty and blindsided by the lack of hospitality
50,Had a great stay. The casino was fun to gamble. Purchased the in and out parking and when we had an issue with it charging us on the way out they fixed issue no questions asked. Great location!! Room was super clean and bed was so comfortable.
20,Poor check in experience front desk said it was a upgraded room yet it wasn't. The front desk really just want to lie to customers face with promised of upgraded room but provided a regular room instead. Very unsatisfactory and left poor taste..
30,This was my first time going to Vegas and I wanted to stay at the Mirage because I heard good thing about the hotel. Everything was good except I had issues with my air conditioner unit and I was sweating all the time in my room which ruined my visit for me.
20,We have stayed at The Mirage many times over the past several years. This time around was very different - dirty rooms and a cockroach. The staff is exceptional. It's a good value hotel now but not luxurious any longer. I would rate Mirage a step above Excalibur or CC at this point.
40,Mirage property was well taken care and staff was friendly/helpful. I will definitely stay there again and you should as well. The staff was taking on the task of making sure all visitors were wearing masks to be safe.
40,Had a good time at this hotel. Bed is comfortable. I used m life rewards and price was reasonable. Casino not busy compared to others on the strip. Only stayed one night would stay longer if had more rewards.
30,My husband and I stayed here for three nights while in Las Vegas. We had an early flight and were able to check in several hours early without paying extra. The front desk was friendly and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable. No fridge or microwave are available in the room. We did not swim but we did checkout the pool. The pool is heated and is very large but is only 3 1/2 feet deep. No breakfast is available in the morning. They have a few restaurants. I'm not into gambling so I'm not sure how their casino compares to others. The hotel is right in the middle of the strip and within walking distance of a lot to do which is the main reason I picked it.
50,Check-in and out was quick and easy. The M-life room was fantastic so clean and fresh. The 12th floor was extremely quiet and peaceful. Never a wait at the elevators. Breakfast at the bar was delicious the servers were very attentive. A definitely will go back.
10,"Travelled with family and friends and the resort fees are not ""one price"" The hotel would not reduce my resort fees to the same amount as the rest of the parties in our group. Really disappointing that not everyone is treated the same."
50,Very good hotel. It was a bit crowded early evening at the hotel but great overall. Great ambience. Saw the Beatles show there too. Food ends early so try to get your meal before 8pm but there are choices outside the hotel too
50,Everything was very well taken care of from check in through check out. Very smooth clean rooms courteous staff sanitizer and masks readily available so they definitely cared about your well-being.
10,Room was not clean at all. Family ended up moving to the Venetian across the street. It was a beautiful resort that was very clean with excellent room service and restaurant. We had a great experience
30,Hotel overall is just ok it is a little dated in comparison to the newer what gives the average rating is the cost for ur stay for the age…however if you get comps to stay then that makes it better staff was very nice beds are not the best…
40,Bait and switch on drink coupons - coupons were given twice. First no tables provided - even though tables clearly open. The second time we were told there was a $50 per person minimum even though that was not the case.
10,Check in was terrible I checked in early that morning by mobile check in once I got there later that night I didn’t have a room and then the clerk tried to charge me $400 deposit because they had to up grade. The air conditioner didn’t work and the room was not clean
50,We really enjoyed our stay there. The amenities were great. The breakfast at the Pantry was quit diverse. The steak at the Heritage was right on. Go easy on the sides two is enough for 2 people we ordered 4 and it was to much.
50,The Mirage isn’t as large as the newer mega Cassini/hotels but I much prefer it that way. The staff is awesome and they all seem to know each other and get a long well they are playful entertaining and professional. The casino floor is well ventilated as to not be soured with a cigarette smell but most casinos as are this way now. Don’t skip this one if you have the opportunity it’s got a great vibe.
40,Ty mirage is a nice resort. Nice casino and a good selection of food. But they let too many dogs in the casino. Lots of barking and this is not what I want when I go to Vegas. So I guess I am saying that I need more characters to leave this.
20,The rooms are in dire need of maintenance. The whole hotel could use a major upgrade. We used to love this place but it’s getting run down. The shower handle is loose and didn’t always work right the toilet runs all on its own the place is getting dirty in the general areas.
40,Loved the Mirage and Vegas. The only issue was what seemed to be serious understaffing at the front desk and in the wait staff in the casino. Overall a great location and loved the administration of the slot tournament.
20,hard to get in and out of if you want to go walking or get a ride.  decent pool. the rooms are a little outdated. staff not very motivated to accomodate or welcoming. i only ate at 1 restaurant there and the it wasnt good either.
50,My family stayed at this resort and was great experience clean rooms and friendly staff. Very safe place where masks are enforced. Restaurants are cleaned and offered good food selection. However reservations are required for most restaurants. The only thing is that there is no buffet.
40,Place is clean staff friendly location good. Should have free fridge option ($35 /day) no buffet was disappointing. Shim Lim show was good but need to be close Michael Jackson did not have enough Cirque content I don’t recommend that show.
10,It was so bad I packed up my family checked out a day early and stayed with family in the area. The next morning I received and email stating I had to checkout by 11:00. I returned to verify if I was was checked out. When I mentioned all the issues at checkout the receptionist was uninterested. Just checked me out and handed me a receipt.
30,I was happy with my stay but the rooms are a bit dated. Heritage steak house was excellent and everyone I encountered was courteous and friendly. COVID-19 protocols were followed consistently and I felt comfortable.
50,"Incredible. We went Thanksgiving week which was way less busy than normal. We got an upgrade from the base room to the ""honeymoon suite"" on the 24th floor. Everything was perfect. The resort smells wonderful the atrium is wonderful the Hobbit slot machine was paying out the whole trip was fantastic! Will be back soon!"
20,Not happy at all I expected more than I received this was my first time in the mirage hotel or in one of the MGM resorts the are hundreds of hotels in Las Vegas however I chose The Mirage because I thought it would be a good idea I’ll have to look for better options…..
20,The Mirage has lost its allure. What once lived up to its name has now faded into cheap rates for a reason. Although you do get a competitive rate for your room with regards to location on the strip the hotel itself is in need of major improvements. The rooms are outdated the casino needs some refurbishments and the room floors have not changed since the ‘90s. Don’t stay at The Mirage because you are drawn to The Mirage’s amenities. Stay for the location on the strip. Would suggest paying more to stay at other MGM properties.
40,Good qualities- I was able to sleep well. MGM app Check in and check out was super easy. Bad qualities - the service was terrible. Staff was unfriendly especially Ashley from the MLife Rewards desk. Also I said no maid service however two days in a row the maid knocked on the door. The second day she knocked then I could hear her trying to open the door. I yelled at her but she still proceeded to open the door. My husband was in the shower and I was hurriedly putting my clothes on. It was very awkward.
30,Like the location as you are close to the alley and enjoy ease of getting to other properties. Rooms are OK outdated compared to other properties but was clean. Restaurants were really good so no need to leave if you don’t want too. Casino floor has a good mix of slots and table games. Overall if you are looking at staying mid strip it’s a great place to stay.
50,We are repeat customer. The location is excellent. Rooms are very spacious and clean. Staff are very courteous friendly and knowledgeable. Everyone at the luggage department were very helpful. Housekeeping is excellent. We love the pool it's beautiful. We had pleasant experience every time we stay at The Mirage.
50,Front Office Manager was very kind to us and gave us room with a really great view of the Strip and the Volcano! Which I could remember his name but he checked us in on November 21st a little after 3pm. The room was very clean and appeared updated as well. The staff was always friendly and helpful. I appreciated the late check-out as well as being able to leave our luggage at the hotel for a few hours after checking out. Water pressure was good. The room was clean and quiet. The hotel is in a great location middle of the strip. Definitely will be staying there again next time.
50,What a great place to stay in Vegas!! Staff is very friendly and helpful! Resort and rooms are very clean and upgraded!! The pool is awesome with large areas and waterfalls! A large variety of restaurants to choose from. We have been coming to Vegas for many years and The Mirage is definitely the BEST Resort we’ve stayed at!!!
30,The door would rattle and share making a loud noise due to the closing of doors next door. The walls are quite thin as you can hear people’s conversations and partying. Pillows were lumpy which made for some sleepless nights.
50,I love this place. Its the right amount of quite and busy. The Location is rather central but not chaotic. Its reasonable pricing and decent amenities makes it great place. The table limits are bit higher than other location but not too high. I have never been out to the pool but hear its nice.
50,Awesome location! Great hotel! Middle of strip! Enjoyed the nights ans days there. There is so much to see there. Shin Lin was a great show as well (a must see) hotel was clean and spaceous rooms and many olaces to eat breakfast.
30,Rooms are minimum and basic. The amenities are subpar. The restaurant hooves are also bare. You can pick better. I had room issues with the AC and they were unaccompdating and i waited for a pillow for over an hour. Unacceptable in my mind when paying a $40 resort fee. You can definitely find better.
50,Hotel room was clean bed comfortable. Restaurants were very good food was fresh and delicious. Pool was clean nice lounge chairs. Bonus they give you as many towels as you want by pool. While checking in employee noticed it was my birthday she gave us a room with an amazing view.
20,dining options were terrible in terms of availability. Who doesn't want a nice breakfast after gambling all night? sorry no coffee shop open and in the morning there is at least an hour wait - Prices for basics were outrageous - $15 for a beer $9 for a soda in the vending machine!! Staff obviously over worked and surly.
10,Room had no coffee. Hidden charges after check out. Double charged for a car valet when I didn’t have a vehicle there because it was wing returned that same day before checking in. No poker room. Cirque show cancelled had to scramble and rebook an earlier show and change dinner reservations. Bed and pillows not comfortable. Better casino options in Vegas. Not worth starting here. Service was awful and Mirage is very outdated.
50,Love staying at Mirage. Location on the Strip is perfect. We do miss the deli that was across from California Pizza. Snacks was okay but nothing beats the deli. Recently sold so let's see what happens.
50,We stayed at The Mirage and thought - okay this is an older hotel. BUT then we fell in love with The Mirage because every restaurant is delicious from Stack to Otaro to Pantry to Snacks to Diablos to California Pizza Kitchen they have it all right there. The slots were loose - I won $100 every time I walked through the place. They have one of the best shows The Beatles Love right inside the place. Then the gym and pool areas are high quality. The only complaint I have is that the tub is outdated and the gym hours open at 9 am.
30,This place really needs a remodeling the lights in the bathroom werent working properly and as well the sides of them wall were peeling but its good for its value and pretty close to everything. But could find better for your value.
40,Good mid level hotel. Good assortment of restaurants and good sized casino without being too big. Rooms could use a little updating. Very reasonable rates. Housekeeping was solid. Not luxury but a great value!
50,We booked a room at the Mirage to make it convenient to see the The Beatles Love Circus. The room was great. The show was good. The only down side it the length of walk from car to room. We would book again without hesitation.
50,My husband and I just spent 3 days at The Mirage. We loved it. Our room was spacious and clean and it had a great view. The on-site restaurants we tried The Still and The Pantry were excellent. The casino was very nice too. Staff were friendly and helpful. In addition The Mirage has a great location on The Strip. We were close to everything else that we wanted to visit. It was an excellent experience.
50,The hotel was beautiful and clean inside. The staff was also very helpful. Only inconvenience was the walk from the parking lot to the elevators but it wasn’t too bad compared to other hotels in the strip. Would definitely stay again!
50,Had a great 6 day stay. This is one of the few hotels which I actually went to the pool and went to the spa and was extremely satisfied. Room service was very fast fresh and delicious. Was out most of the time so the only restaurants I went to were Snacks and The Pantry. I was able to get to the Monorail pretty easily walking across the street in to Harrah's.
40,Room was very good. Excellent housekeeping and cleanliness. Steakhouse service was excellent food was terrible. Burned octopus forgot to bring my spinach steak was ordered rare and was delivered well done. My friend had a suite on the E floor he called and personally went to the front desk numerous times to provide me an access key. Concierge and front desk multiple times refused to provide me a key stating I was not on the room access list. Frustrating!
30,Came into town to celebrate with a group of 20. We had many things planned. I had recently stayed at park mgm which happens to be smoke free and really loved that. I was hoping mirage would be also but it wasn’t. Staff is friendly gambling is fine food is fine.
30,Check in was great our rooms were clean and mostly up to date. Our AC didn’t work though and when we were told the front desk they said it’s because it’s a green hotel so they’re motion sensors. But even at night the air didn’t stay on. It was much warmer and muggier in our room than the hallway. Every time we turned the lights on in the bathroom it would short out and we’d have to reset the plug every time which was real annoying— front desk said they’d have it fixed while we were gone but it did it our whole stay. We mostly usneed d the room for sleep so we just delt with it. Everything was very clean but shower head was weird angle only able to spray on our faces. Pool was great. We weren’t unhappy with our stay— but since we have SO many options next time we will be staying somewhere else.
40,We were looking for a hotel/casino on the strip that was nice but wouldn’t break the bank. The location is great. Beatles show was absolutely incredible. The rooms were very clean and serviced well daily. We liked that you needed a hotel card to use the elevator - good safety measure. The pool is very nice. Cons were small bathrooms that could really use an upgrade and a darker/old feeling casino that could did not clear smoke well
20,Valet! The wait times are ridiculous & the icing on the cake was upon checking out it took them almost 1 hour to find my car I missed my flight by 2 minutes I wasn’t able to check my bags and had to get on the next available flight which was the next day. Such a inconvenience & the only thing they has to offer was an apology
50,"First of all I a a ""Noir Card & Black CC"" holder and the Mirage did not pay one bit of attention to me at the Valet after showing both cards was just shuffled off and then at check in given room 11011 are you kidding me and the person at the VIP desk told me he was giving me a upgrade. I know this review will go untouched by MGM upper casino host but wow when I stay at Aria or Delano or any of their properties this has never happened. I guess when you gamble over a million dollars through their places the Mirage does not care about it's VIP's like the others do."
50,My last trip at The Mirage was amazing. The rooms were clean the staff was friendly and the service was exceptional. The hotel has a lot to offer. The food is amazing and you are smack in the middle of the Las Vegas strip
50,Every aspect of our stay was outstanding. Very clean friendly and helpful staff great food and fun gambling environment. We played the slots and the 21 tables. We had a great time and look forward to our next visit.
40,I've always wanted stay at the Mirage and it didn't disappoint. I did have a mishap in my room but I was immediately accommodated. Great Room Great Service and Grest location on the strip. Restaurants and Casino were on point and the front desk staff was fabulous. Definitely will come back again.
50,It was a wonderful experience from the beginning. From check in to the rooms everything was wonderful.. The staff was friendly and accommodating on everything they ask if we needed anything else and they would get it done right away. The room was amazing since it was a stay well king and the view was awesome we'll be staying again soon
40,Overall we had a good stay. The room was nice with a comfy bed. The location was great and walking distance to everything. On the downside the werent heated like we were told the resort fees are high and you have to pay for parking.
40,Our only complaint is our type of room wasn’t available. So we were required to take a discounted room. Should of been offered a upgrade instead of proposed with a lower grade  AC didn’t work cleanliness behind furniture and went from King to Queen bed.
20,Wanted a more elegant experience for the money and the location. Rates changed at checkout which should be illegal. The resort fee was also not included until checkout. Extremely noisy rooms  hallway sound is heard easily. Great view however
10,When I checked in after standing in a long line I was told my room wasn't ready. I was also told I needed to go back outside to stand in another long line to check my bags with the bell hop desk. When my room was ready I walked into a room that was so filthy. The dust and grime was everywhere. The carpeting was buckled so I kept tripping on it the whole time. The shower head was so caked with hard water gunk that it sprayed obnoxiously all over the place.
50,From the outside walking in very beautiful!!  Walking in omg they have a huge fish tank behind the front desk and the line was so quick! I checked in about noon off my flight and not a bit line but the first checking me in very sweet  Cute little bridge walk over with a waterfall get to my room which had a view of the volcano went off every hour super cool look at  Room was nice very clean shower was basic and the fridge can't use for personal liquor which I was bummed about  Pool very pretty water fall and warm the hot tub was broken sadly and it was overcast and 70s when I went so it was kinda chilly but under the waterfall of the pool is super warm FYI also they have a bar really good drinks strong!  Also good hotel to be in the middle of everything not far at all
30,This has long been our favorite Vegas property but time has taken its toll on her especially with the guest rooms. The bathtub/shower backed up leaving us standing in a deep puddle as it has in previous trips. The door to the room safe keypad was falling off. Its prime location still makes it a desirable destination but the quality of guest rooms has become a major disappointment.
50,The mirage never disappoints. I had a great experience. Felt safe and treated very well  Staff was excellent from environmental services to food prep.  Never disappointed in the staff physical plant and surely a perfect location
40,The room was great. It smelled fresh as you walked in. Only 2 things were not good. The fan in the bathroom did not work and it was really dusty at the very top of the bed frame. It was either really thick or they were cobwebs.
50,Everything in this hotel is extremely well taken care of clean very little smoke in the air rooms are spotless. However this hotel is not friendly to handicapped people. Attempting to rent a scooter is a nightmare I would highly recommend not even trying it at this hotel.
20,WIFI is a joke! Be prepared to use your 5G cell plans for internet. Also the properties own exhibits charge you even if you are a paying guest. Be prepared for a very smoke filled environment. It is really thick.
50,I really enjoyed that I could just go to my room and didn't have to wait in line. Also housekeeping knew not to come into the room tell later. They also kept the rooms very clean. Showers could have a little more pressure though.
50,Lost my wallet with some cash driver's license and credit cards. Staff was very understanding but not much they could do about it. Used there web site to enter details. Wallet was found and Mirage mailed it to me and EVERTHING was in the wallet like it never left me. How nice is that?
50,G.O.A.T. for any MGM Property..!!    Highly recommend this property regardless on reason to experience Las Vegas.    The feeling of being safe is my top priority. Security presence is huge I feel as there is such a huge presence there that they become great deterrents from people looking to cause harm or try to get out of line. The ERT Team will constantly show presence and I felt very safe with the thousands of people around.
40,Excellent location with great views and friendly staff overall. Pricey slots and table games but this is the norm for the strip these days unfortunately. This and the pool closing early are the big things deducting a perfect score. Would recommend for a first time Vegas stay. Rooms were comfortable and clean but a little dated. Walking distance of many strip attractions with some classics of its own such as the Volcano and Secret Garden was the cherry on top. Had a Blast!
40,The Mirage is conveniently located and is home for Beatles LOVE our primary reason for going. Room was comfortable clean and quiet. Staff was friendly and competent. Pricing seemed to be high for some basics like food and drinks $6.00 for coffee and $10-12 for simple mixed drinks but we are not used to the new Las Vegas price levels yet either.
30,"Only 2-3 agents at check in. Waited almost an hour to check in at 9pm on a Monday night. Then given wrong room # and tried to enter someone else's room. After going back down to front desk agent says ""oh she must have written the wrong room # down"". That was it. Resort in nice and casino is busy. Rooms are nice and housekeeping is doing a good job. Disappointed in front desk check in staff."
10,"It all started when we had to wait nearly 4 hours for a room that we had already booked. After waiting in line for 30 minutes to speak with a desk clerk (despite there were 4 others just walking behind the desk apparently doing anything but checking the guests in) we finally were able to speak to someone about getting our room. They put a ""rush service"" on the room.....twice....to have the room cleaned. 4 hours later we get to our room only to find that the shower was a bit moldy the shower faucet handle was loose and the security latch on the door was nearly falling off. We took a couple things out of the fridge in the room (the alcohol provided by the hotel) to make room for our water. We immediately returned the items to the fridge only to be charged with a $400 bill for the items in the fridge. We explained to the clerk at check out that we didnt use these items and they were placed back in the fridge. He could care less about what we had to say and had a bit of an attitude while explaining that we would be hit with an additional $80 restocking fee for the fridge (basically to pay for someone to inventory the fridge). Trust me.....nothing is positive about this hotel. Attitudes cleanliness and hidden charges. I regret staying in this hotel."
30,Upon entering our room we were immediately hit with heat and humidity as if we had just walked into a sauna and we could smell mold. We had just driven from a beach in Cali and I wanted to wash my legs off in the tub and I noticed a yellow liquid in the corner of the tub which appeared to be rusty water. I washed it off and as I continued to run the faucet I noticed the caulking seal around the tub edge and tile was seeping water. By the time we got back from dinner we didn't feel like changing rooms because we were exhausted. The room especially the bathroom continued to stay hot and humid despite running the A/C all night. Next morning we noticed the corner of the carpet pulled up like they had to deal with some sort of leaking issue.  We complained to the front desk upon checking out and they were unwilling to compensate or refund us in any way and acted like they really didn't care. Very disappointed as we had never stayed at the Mirage even though we have been to Vegas many times and we were really looking forward to our stay. We won't be back.
50,I traveled to Vegas for work we stayed at The Mirage. Great experience helpful staff. I do recommend. The room could have been cleaner there was some small trash on the floor and the shower curtain rod was sagging. Regardless it wasn't enough to keep me from coming back the good out weighed the bad.
40,Excellent location for staying on the strip. Good variety of restaurants. We were appreciative of free parking with our Pearl status. Most of the staff was courteous and nice except for one gal at the concierge desk who was very rude.
50,My wife and I both love the atmosphere and location on the strip of the Mirage Casino. The shows and the theaters are as good as it gets in Vegas. Love & Shin Lim are both top notch productions. I also saw Daniel Tosh on the night I was there. Hilarious! Easy casino to get around and my wife particularly is a fan of the pool area!
40,Overall it was a great experience. Nice friendly staff clean room. I just wish the bathrooms were a little bigger in the rooms and that they came with a fridge you could actually use without paying additional.
30,The people staff and workers were great. the hotel is just old. it really needs to be updated. you still have a tub shower in the room? painted over rusted out metal door fames they beds were terrible sunk in on the one side where if only one person sleeps that is where is sunken in. either flip mattress or get new ones??? Also you it still smells like smoke everywhere you go...
10,If you love mold in the bathrooms dust bunnies everywhere and a property that looks like it should have been remodeled or demolished years ago then this is the property for you! The trip was pre-booked and they still managed to screw up the billing for the rooms to the point where two managers had to get involved and admitted they were embarrassed and apologized for their system.
20,Dirty loud and irritating is how I would describe our stay. The room had lip marks on the drinking glasses drips from some unknown liquid on some of the furniture a torn head board on one side and the smell in the room was bad. In addition we continually had issues with the elevators (as did many other guests) our key cards not working in the parking garage (had to be replaced 3 times) and the ground level walkway from parking to the hotel is dangerous. Overall this was not a good experience and I will stay somewhere else next time I'm there.
10,"The hotel is rapidly deteriorating. The carpeting in the casino is worn and dirty looking the ventilation system needs servicing or updated as the pervasive angel of cigarette smoke overwhelms. It used to be a beautiful sanctuary with great shiny polished dolphins and mermaids greeting you with the wonderful angel of the tropics... not the brass is tarnished and the only place it smells good is the small 10' entry area between the outer doors and the inner casino doors.  Then off to the room...  When I walked in I was greeted by 6 different sets of slimy looking handprints on the window you need to look through to see the pool. That combined with the peeling and missing paint on the baseboards crumbs on the floor from the previous guest and hairs in the tub and sink made me feel like it wasn't cleaned well.  I asked management for another room and he said ""I'm sorry we just don't have the inventory."" I offered to pay to upgrade to a suite and was denied. That was worrisome being I knew I had a 12 day stay ahead of me but hoped things would get better.  I asked housekeeping to clean the room while I was out and left the room for hours. When I got back the room wasn't cleaned and I discovered the bathroom light didn't work. (Even the vanity mirror was broken with the power knob missing.)"
50,Confortable and affordable ambience is great and safe on the location game floor always clean Beatles show is great  staff friendly and kind Pantry restaurant is delicious and great option  lastly pool was incredible.
20,"The night we wanted to eat at Otoro turned into I night I will never forget. The host that night was extremely rude and short and should not be working there. I happen to ask if there was sitting at the bar for dinner and she said yes- so I pointed to an empty table at the bar and asked if that was available and in a really consdencending and deameaning voice said to me""No Mam that is a table and the bar is over there with the stools"" She made me feel like an idiot who did not know the difference. I asked for the manager to complain and all he said that he was sorry gave the excuse that they were busy and that he would talk to her - right I'm sure he did! Not!"
40,The people are nice and friendly. The service was good. The beds are very comfortable. The machines seemed to be a little tight. The sports book is now a sports betting area so if you like to bet the horses like I do you’ll have to find another place. Do yourself a favor a do a bathroom precheck after arriving at you room the drains were slow and the facets didn’t work that well if you can believe that but really the hotel was a nice experience
20,The checking in and making reservations was a total disaster. If we didn’t call ahead and check would have gotten there with no room. Charge was not returned till we called or handled the problem. Has been resolved. Charges are ridiculous avg cost 50$ per person.
50,The mirage is a nice clean and a beautiful stay. Not the worst price either. We didn’t want to leave. They were really busy and at times it was hard to find a staff member but there’s so many people staying there that you can ask around 🤣
50,During my brokerage convention everything has been amazing. The room staff from front desk to bell service and drinks at the lobby bar etc I’d say overall happy I stayed there. Next vacation will be at the mirage again! Thank you!
50,Clean clean clean. The room had a great view to the pool and could also see part of the strip. We had two queen beds and they were nice and confortable also nice pillows. Carpet was clean the room had no odor. I will request Stay Well Rooms again!
50,Great service at the MIRAGE! The housekeeping staff was attentive and friendly. They anticipated our needs and exceeded our expectations. We would definitely stay there again and refer it to our family and friends.
50,Overall the Mirage did not disappoint. Our room was clean and comfortable and the views were awesome! However we were a little disappointed in some of the hidden costs such as $18 for a bottle of water. We also found it odd that we did not have a microwave refrigerator or coffee pot in our room. We were used to East coast time so waiting until 6:00 am PST (9 EST) for a coffee shop to open was not optimal. Also we had leftovers quite a few times with no where to store them.
50,Love the convenience they provide. I didn’t have to stay in a long queue to check in everything is done through the app including opening your own room. You use the app as well to get into the guest elevator which to me is safe coz if they don’t stay in the hotel then they can’t access the floors. I feel secured. They offer dining options and the casino is quite loose on slots.
50,I Highly recommend The Mirage Hotel. Staff was friendly and facility was very clean. I wish the rooms had a frig but not a big deal. Beds were comfortable. You can walk along the strips from the hotel. I will be back again.
50,Room service excellent  housekeeping Covid safe place I been to Las Vegas many times a stay in the MGM  Firts time in the mirage I love it recommended to make reservations to all restaurants and I recommend this hotel and I will stay again see you soon
20,Hotel is tired stuck in the 90's and all of the rooms need to be renovated. There was construction on our floor and no one warned us so we could request a different location. Our shower leaked and no one cared. When we complained about the construction noise they would only move us to a lesser basic room with no credit for the downgrade or inconvenience.
50,You would think that parking would be free if you were staying there! The service was exceptional and the pool area is absolutely amazing! The staff seamed polite and professional! Rooms were very clean and I really wanted to bring that bed home with me! Check in and check out we’re easy also
30,Ran out of type room I requested. Wanted to charge a platinum member $40 for a rollaway bed. I am disabled and on a Scooter provided us with a standard room with tiniest bathroom every that I was unable to use. Didn't offer an Accessible room. After losing a significant amount of money I requested help from a host who was veery rude and unprofessional.
40,With the Mirage up for sale. I am concerned I won’t be getting the same perks as I am getting now which is concerning. I enjoy the amenities that the Mirage has too offer. MLife Rewards has been beneficial in my stay at the Mirage.
50,Excellent accommodations at the Mirage. I was thrilled with the room size cleanliness and the proximity to other local venues. Dining is important to me and several excellent options are available within the casino.
50,Great Hotel Great Service Clean Room Nice Casino Friendly people good food in the restaurants. We were there for a real estate conversion. The convention area was very nice and all breakouts rooms were close together. Did not have to do excessive walking.
20,"Reserved a King room all sold out so had to take a double queen. Not sure that a reservation means much. Room was filthy. They clearly only hit the high spots. Previous guests used soap and shampoo left in the tub. Paint peeling on tub. Mold on the tile. Handprint on the mirror. Dirty glasses. This is supposed to be ""stepped up cleaning"" for covid. SMH"
30,I can't believe as much as they charge for the room that the fridge is locked. They said it's owned by a 3rd party vendor and they would unlock it for $50. I said I just want to put my energy drinks in it. Nope $50. Had to use the ice bucket and put one drink in every night so it's cold for morning. Heater didn't work sheets were thin.
40,Hotel is stunning. Volcano show is beautiful and dramatic. Casino is great. Restaurants in hotel are great and food is delicious. There really is no need to leave the property. The pool is gorgeous! Great for R&R.
40,The rooms were pricey yet they were nice and clean. However it drives me crazy how they have no coffeemaker in the room no place to put waters in a fridge etc. Especially for the price. The rest of the casino location and overall experience was good.
10,Our bathroom flooded. Getting all of our clothes wet. It was never taken care of. We went to the front desk they said it would be cleaned up. It never was. Our room was dirty. We were not happy with the stay at all.
30,Still a nice resort and the price is good but the rooms are extremely average bathroom nothing to write home about and room service is not good you can only order from one restaurant and dinner is not on the menu.
30,"Room was damp Floor beside the AC was wet Room was dirty Concierge desk was fantastic everyone else had the ""I'm too busy for you"" demeanor... The only reason we were there was because of a conference happening in the hotel - next time we'll try to stay elsewhere."
40,I went to Vegas for a conference and the stay at Mirage was wonderful. All the employee's were kind and helpful no matter what department they worked in. Thank you for a wonderful stay. The only thing I would of liked better is the smoke in the casino was less and handled better with a better system to get it out.
50,Always love staying at Mirage! The food choices are good the MLife comp program is great and the rooms are comfortable. I wish the slots were more loose but that’s true of every major casino on the strip.
40,I like this hotel my 3rd time visiting. The Casino allows smoking everywhere. Tired of my clothes smelling like smoke on returning to my room. Your sitting at a table then Smoking Joe shows up with his Cigar. Nasty
20,Cellphone stolen and hotel did nothing. Security was rude and treated me like I did something wrong. Also someone tried to break into my car while parked in the parking garage. All they care about is taking your money.
50,Very clean great staff close to everything exceptional pool and hot tub! I went for a real estate conference and my stay there couldn't have been any better. If there was only one critique it would be a way to make elevator use to different floors easier. We would have invite only mastermind sessions in suites and would have to have someone meet us on the main floor elevator hallway every-time someone would want to go up and weren't staying on that floor.
20,Beds were not very comfortable restaurants were all booked for every meal I had to go off property or order from room service that took way too long and the food was cold. Shower head was so hard it hurt. Bell service lost my luggage for 40 minutes and then blamed a new system. When it finally came the guy practically threw it into my brand new Cadillac Escalade and scratched the plastic in the back of my car and the luggage.
50,Amazing Staff Hotel and Service. Very convenient near the mall Restaurants and the strip. The check in process on the phone it's pretty cool. I'll definitely recommend the Mirage for your stay in Las Vegas. I'll be back.
10,I was staying in a penthouse suite at the Mirage hotel to celebrate my 40th birthday with my wife and friends. The suite itself wasn’t that nice and despite Covid it wasn’t very clean either. 100% not worth the money! We spent a long weekend here and ate and drank and gambled and spent an incredible amount of money here. Our last night we were watching the Chiefs - Raiders game in the sports book when a man pooped right in front of us in the middle of the sports book. Now I’ve been to Vegas a lot and I’ve seen some crazy stuff here but never saw somebody poop in the casino in front of guests. People were horrified. I complained to security about cleaning it up and they did absolutely nothing. Five security guards literally just stood there staring at this pile of poop while me and other guests directed people not to step in it. At one point somebody did step in it and I said to security “Why didn’t you tell him it was there?” The security guard shrugged his shoulders. There were loads of people around horrified and disgusted. I asked multiple times if they were going to clean it up and nobody did anything. They didn’t even apologize. After about a half hour a woman showed up with cleaner and I said thank you and clapped for her. At that point the head of security came up to me and said I had to leave. I told him I wasn’t the one who pooped on the floor and he told me I had to leave because I was cursing. In the sports book. Full of drunk people. Also cursing because they were excited about the Chiefs winning sad about the Raiders getting blown out or horrified by the poop. Somebody pooped right in front of me in a hotel where I was spending thousands of dollars to stay in a penthouse suite and I was told I had to leave. How does that make any sense? Basically this aggro security dude was embarrassed that I was calling them out for not doing their job. I apologized for cursing but again said I was a guest and they should have cleaned up the poop when me and other guests first complained about it. I was not offered an apology or any explanation. I was kicked out of the hotel faster than they picked up the poop. I will never stay at the Mirage or another MGM property again. This hotel is not worth the money given the quality of the rooms and I’m sure any hotel where a guest witnessed somebody poop right in front of them in the middle of a casino they’d at least be offered an apology or a drink ticket or a free play. Do not stay at the Mirage!
40,Overall my experience at the mirage was pretty amazing. My girlfriend became carsick on the way and the staff was very helpful upon our arrival with expediting our check in and put a rush on getting my room clean so I could get her out of the lobby and in a comfortable space until she felt better. Very grateful for the front desk staff making that happen. I valet parked the first night then moved to self parking the remaining 2 nights. But as a result of a system upgrade I was charged for 3 night self parking as well as having to pay for the valet parking. The mirage is one of the original biggest most beautiful resorts and the room and property is amazing. The only little hiccup was that the AC in my room didn’t seem to work and would only blow the fan without cooling off the room. Got toasty. Otherwise was a great experience. Staff was great on all levels from the bellman to the front desk to the bartenders and beyond.
40,The place is nice clean modern. The doors don't quite fit the frame therefore you hear a lot of hallway noise. The Starbucks there is very efficient as is Snacks there low end diner. Nice place overall.
50,We had a fantastic time. enjoyed the pool the gaming and the food. The rooms were up to date and clean and the bed was comfortable. The Cirque de Soliel show Beatles Love was incredible. Enjoyed the sports book as weel (cause my beloved Dolphins won!!). Thanks for a great time!
50,I think the Mirage is a very nice hotel with a great location on the strip. Our room was very clean check-in and other service was good and the price was reasonable. I do wish the coffee beanery had more workers because the wait was long in the morning. I would recommend this property for your Vegas vacation.
50,First time staying at The Mirage and we loved it. The best feature I loved and worth paying was my early check got in my room once I arrived we got lucky that our room was ready for arrival after our flight at 9am got time to rest for the night. Also loved the app having to carry my room on my phone never forgot it inside like we usually would forget a room key.
40,The rooms are good. The pool is very nice but drinks are expensive and different prices. The spa is great but crowded and only three chairs for the whole place. Again very expensive and rates change on the weekend but great expensive massage. Location is ok. Close to other places with more restaurants.
50,The Mirage may be an older property but by far the best experience on the strip.  We are regulars in the Las Vegas escape community and find the Mirage to be the most home like casino on the strip.  Our host Willie is the kindest host we have ever met!
50,The Mirage is a great place to stay in Vegas. The hotel is clean & the staff is great. Good food offered in several venues unlike some of the larger properties which seem overcrowded & expensive. I just keep coming back. Casino is great fun & the pool area is large yet cozy with great drink & food service. Staff is professional yet caring.
40,Great location and a beautiful property. The pool area is one of my favorite in Vegas. We also love the food options at Mirage. We had decent luck throughout the casino. My only issue was hallway noise carried into our room quite badly.
10,My wife and I booked a wonderful room. The reservation was confirmed a number of times over the months until we finally arrived at the Mirage. When we checked in we were informed that the room we wanted had been oversold and we had to move to another room. We were given a “30%” discount “for our troubles but the room we received was 1/2 the size we’d reserved on the wrong side of the building and the AC didn’t work properly. Beyond that the service was fantastic (room spa restaurants). Friendly staff.
20,The app is terrible and does not work. I booked 3 rooms and spent 2 hours trying to check-in on the app. I booked the 2 queen resort room but was a deluxe hospitality suite was assigned. I thought this was an upgrade because of the mention of suite. But its actually a downgrade there is nothing special about this this is where they rent out the attachment to a regular suite. The noise level can be high depending on your neighbor and that was the case in this instance.    The items in the room available for purchase is also a scam no prices advertised and is a total rip-off. I got charged $18 for a bottle of water. Stay away from picking items
50,The Mirage was clean with comfortable rooms and is centrally located on the strip. Loved the pool and the Secret Garden. My husband was there partially for business but there was access to plenty of activities with our 16 year old daughter while he attended meetings and then for family time after.
20,Skip this overpriced hotel. I stayed here for a week for a conference. The rooms are small and dated. No amenities at all in room. No fridge(unless you want to pay) No robes no coffee makers. It’s fine if you’re paying an affordable price but I paid over $1500 for 6 nights. TI is not far off with a comparable hotel for half the price. Im not sure why the Mirage is so pricy compared to others but it’s not worth it. The location is great but I would not stay here again.
50,Check-in was easy and accommodating (we arrived 4 hours before posted check-in time and was in our room a couple of hours later. Choose to get a physical key card but did hear from other guests about the room key not working all the time on their phones. Room was clean and spacious.
50,We were waiting in line to check out and the security guard stopped by to speak with each customer to spread joy. He invited us to come back and stay there-in his house :). He treated it like his ministry! Then the general manager stopped to speak with us personally thanking us for staying with them. I did not expect this-pleasantly surprised.
40,We thoroughly enjoyed our first trip to Las Vegas. The Mirage was the perfect combination of value amenities and location for our first trip to Vegas. The staff were very helpful and polite. The location was perfect close proximity to everything. We would certainly go back to the Mirage.
50,We stayed here for eXpCon and had a great time! Beds were great and we're both very particular about our beds. The hotel was a great location and had lots to do! Great pool area and overall a glamorous experience.
40,Very nice facility with great staff. The facility is very clean. And the housekeeping staff is always willing to help with any of your needs. Just wish the Rhum bar was still open but other than that was a very nice resort
30,My wife and I left the Mirage feeling Let Down. We came for the eXp Convention anticipating a wonderful experience by being catered to. By contrast we were billed for condiments later removed from our bill.  We looked forward to our trip to be memorable for all the right reason however we left feeling let down.
30,Good location but to me just average experience. Restaurants all had long waiting times. Smokey. smokey. smokey.. Really no vegan or vegetarian options other than fries chips salad and just a couple of items at Diablos.
20,Service in room was good front desk good security failed two times to assist with problem they were asked to assist with the bed was OK little lumpy keys should work however failing 5 times in a 5 day stay was crazy bad. Never had a key fail so many times. Most of the people friendly and the place was clean. Just not as much to do as far as restraunts and tables to play.
30,As an OG on the strip... mama needs a makeover. Old decor dated rooms tired furniture. Someone please give this old girl some love. No coffee in the rooms and a liter of bottled water is $18.00. Good luck with room service - waited 47 minutes to order and then another 45 for delivery. Food was cold upon arrival. Walls are very thin! Service on ALL levels is amazing - staff is so friendly and courteous.
40,The hotel experience was good overall for a work trip. We were on a conference and the restaurants were the perfect mix of easy casual food and finer dining. I like the size of the hotel for easy access to everything while on a busy schedule. I wouldn't recommend the aromatherapy upgrade. It wasn't good but overall the hotel was great and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful.
40,The room was spacious staying at end of a long hall so had 2 sets of windows. Quiet location but a long walk (did me good though). Bathroom needs attention. Mildew in shower/tub toilet constantly running.
50,This area is huge which I guess is standard for Las Vegas. Unfortunately I kept getting lost and had no idea where I was going half the time. I did have a great time while there and was treated with respect and dignity.
50,Our very first trip to Vegas. We came for the Big Smoke event and had an exceptional time. The Mirage staff was on point the whole time. Friendly accommodating and regularly making recommendations to enhance our stay. The cleaning staff on the 14th floor south was super nice and ensured we had what we needed. Although this is at the top of our budget I suspect we will be back for more fun and the experience in the future.
40,There are many beautiful things about the Mirage. But the magic kind of faded when I saw the bathroom in our room. It was an old tub with rust stains a lumpy tub floor and a non-moving shower head that just blasted water EVERYWHERE. When / If the guest room bathrooms get upgraded The Mirage will be a classy place all throughout.
50,It is never underestimated the enjoyment one can have at a first class hotel! It is a sad time to hear the Mirage is being sold. I hope the next owners don't change anything. The entertainment food and casino is a blast!
30,The sink was covered a layer of brown debrids when I first walk in I have no idea what was that it's disgusting and cleaned myself.  The bad must de very old it completely lost its cusion and only a thin layer of not even the comforter... My wife called cold every night.
30,There was a water leak outside my room which continued for 3 of the 4 days I was there. The last day a maintenance man attempted to enter my room at 6:30am. The interior is dated and badly needs updating.
20,The Big Smoke can do better. The ventilation was poor service was just ok it was a little disappointing. The MGM Corporate really needs to send teams to these hotels to get honest reports to use....
50,Good value and close to a lot of fun things to do. Very friendly staff and clean. Saw the Magic show which was very impressive also the Dolphin habitat and Lion habitats were very cool I will definitely be staying again
10,The staff were amazing the casino food stores etc were good… the rooms were good too except YOU HEAR EVERYTHING!!! I jumped out of bed 2-3 times EACH NIGHT because you can literally here the key card beeping from rooms around you!!! I have never been to a hotel where you hear every noise made in the hallway all the way into the room. Great people good amenities but HORRIBLE noise mitigation in the rooms.
50,My experience during an eXp Realty event at the Mirage couldn't have been better!!! My check in was flawless accommodations on the 10th floor was perfect and everywhere I ate was GREAT!!! Staff is super accommodating and friendly...I hadn't been to the Mirage in over 15 years and it was even better now than I remembered it being! I have always enjoyed this property.
10,"To quote Seinfeld ""the point of the reservation is to HOLD the reservation...anyone can take one"" I booked a particular room with a king in a particular location 3 months prior to arrival and checked in remotely that morning yet my room was not available when I got there. Instead I got a sub par room that had drips on the fridge and cabinets. A $75 food credit was my ""consolation prize"" with a front desk attitude of take it or leave it. I certainly will NOT be back. There are plenty of other places that will want me and my company - that had over 5000 people staying there - business."
50,If you love fluffy pillows a bed you just sink into exceptional food & service. The Mirage is the place to go!! The venue was stunning well kept & up to date. The pool was just perfect: large & very accommodating for our large party.
20,Don’t expect much sleep. You can hear everything going on in the hallways and down the hallways.    The Still bar manager was pretty nasty. Obviously not cutout to be interacting with lots of people trying to get a table.
40,Bed was very comfortable. Room was quiet. Great views. Just need to put a coffee maker and coffee in the room. Very inconvenient for true coffee drinkers to have to jump out of bed get dressed and run downstairs to stand in line to buy a cup of coffee. A microwave and refrigerator would be real nice too considering I always have leftovers and hate wasting food. Free parking for ALL guests should go without saying. The room was wonderfully clean and comfortable and I did enjoy my stay.
50,We had a King Bed in a wonderful room with lots of space and it was decorated beautifully. My husband and I particularly enjoyed the beautiful pool area and spent a couple of afternoons there. We did not have to wait long on the elevators (good!) and we also liked that the Mirage is in a central location on the Strip which is convenient to walk everywhere.
50,We had the best time playing the slots and all the accommodations in a long time!! We have stayed in the Mirage quite a few times. We missed coming out last year and we couldn’t wait to come to Los Vegas this year. The only concern was the food was so expensive. If we were a family of 4  it would have broke our bank. We did miss eating at the buffet. All and all everything was wonderful and our view out out room was beautiful!
50,Being a Marine and a former Deputy Sheriff The Mirage staff go out of their way to make me feel like family and safe while on property. I always get stuck at the end of the hall long walk for a Heart Transplant.
10,Didn't believe I paid my deposit in cash had me wait so long for them to check cameras missed my bus back to California was charged for the time my lyft was waiting for me outside . Deposit was returned in the end as they found i did pay in cash.
50,It was a beautiful hotel in the center of everything very clean they practice using masks when u walked around hotel even when gambling I recommend it to anyone .oh the cost was very reasonable and they even let me stay later for a small fee
50,Mirage was just simply the best We got through the check in line and no time at all got excellent rooms lunch rooms we attended the big smoke there We went to a couple restaurants where we got great service and also the bars
40,Stayed for the weekend sports books had plenty of tellers and app support. Rooms are spacious and clean but could use updating - can’t beat the central location and would go back. The check in process was great and the representative was super helpful.
10,We’re all requested for room with volcano view but we all 3 rooms didn’t get it and When we did all booking the room with view got an extra more price so we paid more 100 dollars for each room per night once we checked in here they didn’t provide us what we requested and they gave us 2 room with some partial part of strip view and one room without and kind of good view and we need to pay the same price which is unfair I raised this issues and let the staff knew about that then she replied back that she doesn’t have available room with volcano’s view for us but she gonna waive all the resort fee for us instead which is less value than the price I paid and one of the room which is has no nice view she’s not match the price for that kind of room for us but provided no resort fee instead which is we didn’t want it and the way she talked to me was kind of a bit unprofessional and not so nice. Bad experience for me as it’s my wedding day I don’t think I will be back here again. No more The mirage
40,Fun place to stay close to most things. I liked that this place was better smoke filtration than others in area. It still Kinda baffles me though that a place can scream about wearing a mask but as long as you are smoking and blowing your Covid smoke airborne in peoples faces that’s ok not to mask up.
30,Our room on the 19th floor with partial view of pool is in need of some maintenance .the cabinets made of wood are worn with marks. The headboard of the King be has large searches on it . The carpet is in need of a good clean. Bathroom is very small and needs updating .    Disappointed as I've wanted to stay here. We are only staying one night now and moving to another newer hotel on the strip.
30,We have been staying at The Mirage for years and we love it. We feel the rooms need to be re-done. We love the casino restaurants and location. If the rooms got a refresh it would be great. Also The Pantry needs to open 24 hours.
50,Great motel friendly and helpful staff. We will stay there again. Located perfect on the strip with access to other casinos and eating places. Loved the pool area as we used it this stay. We have had numerous stays there and always a great time
50,This was probably our 5th time staying at The Mirage. The first time was in 2011.    We thoroughly enjoyed every stay. Each time we stayed in a tower king room. They are a little more money but they've always been very nice rooms and are quiet.    One of the great features of the Mirage is location you're right in the middle of a lot of the resorts.
40,Great fun resort! Central strip location with everything we need. Customer service and perks were really good on this trip. My travel companions also enjoyed the volcano lobby aquarium and indoor rain forest! Valet was excellent!
50,All staff were very helpful and friendly . Our room was beautiful and if we go again we will definitely stay there. Located in a great area we're you could just walk to other attractions. There was always a cab at the hotel if you wanted to travel farther down the strip. The pool area is beautiful and we ate of the best meals at the Cafe in the pool area.
50,Excellent stay. Loved the stay well room. Have always stayed at the mirage when we go to Las Vegas and it has always been a great experience with great service. Highly recommend Excellent location on the strip.
50,Love the location. Very vibrant area. Great staff. Good variety of slots although they were very tight. It would be great if there was more food choices. Room was nice very clean and spacious. Comfortable and decorated nicely.
50,The Mirage was a great hotel. Location is great. Not far off the strip. Room clean and beds comfy!  Good restaurants and good friendly service.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a nice hotel. Enjoy it as we did!
50,The mirage is an awesome location. Although its sad that MGM is selling it .but always clean and relaxed feel when visiting. Fine dining is a plus aswell..pool is amazing and the animals..I'm visiting for this Christmas and a raiders game ..can't wait
50,This is a beautiful property in a great location. Rooms are clean. Staff is friendly. Amenities are great. Only downside.... the water pressure in the shower is basically non existent. If you have long hair pack dry shampoo... you'll need it!
40,Comped stay. Room 24064. Upgraded tower with larger bathroom and separate shower. Everything very clean and room was great.  View of the Volcano which can be loud later in the night. Also hallway noise was quite loud too.  But loved the room.  Food options and hours of operation were a let down. Will be a factor on returning.  Casino staff were wonderful! In fact all hotel staff were great.
50,Great experience . I always have a good time there. The staff was great.. bed super comfy. The hotel/casino is in a great location on the strip.  The rooms are a bit pricey .. but worth it. There are a lot of good food options as well.
20,You check in very nice lobby and then you walk through a giant very tall greenhouse of sorts and it is wonderful.    However to get to your room you enter this walk through the casino which defeats the entire purpose of first impressions.    In this day and age why can't you at the very least make it a no smoking area so that when a customer arrives to go to the elevator they can do so without a trail of cigarette smoke around them.    It's a huge casino and it wouldn't be that complicated to make that section non-smoking.    First impressions matter and the initial smoke you inhale from someone at a slot machine takes away from the entrance.
50,Had a great time ..gambling was fun ..food was excellent..great and friendly staff..rooms were very and clean and great housekeeping..Mirage is in the perfect spot close to everything especially walking distance will be back soon ..Woo Woo
30,"Property and room were clean and as expected. The relationship between Allegiant and MGM is somewhat challenged at least in this experience. Be careful to understand the name of the hotel reservation as it may be different than the person making the reservation with Allegiant. We were told it was the ""oldest person on the itinerary"" for whatever reason. This caused substantial problems as they couldn't find the reservation and refused to help locate it with Allegiant."
50,My friend and I were mid-way of the Vegas strip and walked to and from other ho y els with ease. Enjoyed having breakfast at the Cafe near the elevators each morning...delicious food won a Major Jackpot once and several hundred throughout my 4 day stay. Staff was professional and friendly. Thanks for a wonderful time!
20,My Host disappointed me when I had a problem. Very hard to get in contact with. Late replies to my text and no resolution to my problems. I will never again use this Mirage Host. I was never told about my benefits to certain programs I was suppose to get. Very late replies to my texts if even at all. He did accommodate my stay but was never accommodating. I will not be staying at the Mirage in the future . Other hotels treated me much nicer.
20,"This is one of the older hotels on the strip and it definitely shows it's age. The food options in the hotel are horrible. The only option for a quick meal is ""snacks"" where a burger fries and a beer will run you $45 and the burger is basically a hockey puck. Get up in the morning and there is only one option avaialble for breakfast and there is no place where you can just grab a cup of coffee and egg sandwich or a pastry. You walk next door to Ceasar's or across the street to the Wynn or Venetian and there are dozens of options. With so many other options avilable on the strip I will not stay here again. For the same price point you can stay at New York New York and several other hotels and they all have 5 times the amount of resturants and entertianment options that The Mirage does."
40,Stayed at Mirage during trip to SEMA. Great location rooms were Ok but getting a little tired. Good restaurant selection with Still Essential Heritage etc. Daily Resort fees of $44 added to bill. It is unfortunate that LV still allows smoking in Casinos which you have to walk through. LV also mandated masks in all indoor locations and Mirage enforces.
50,nice facility; no negative issues; keyless check in and door remotes made check in process easy and check out process was easy. there was a good presence of security inside and outside the facility making this feel like a safe place to be
20,Location of The Mirage is prime. It is located off of the strip. The issue I had with the staff were the amenities that were included-- which were none. I had to pay for any parking over 1 hour and was charged once when I left exactly 1 hour later (it clocked me at 1 hour 1 minute). The location is good since it is on the strip but the restaurants were overpriced and wasn't anything special or gimmicky (like Hell's Kitchen or Guy Fieri's). It was just Mexican food and some other breakfast places. I also didn't like how we pay so much for the resort fee but they still have the audacity to charge for water in addition to the parking. Water bottles aren't included with the stay and we didn't even have an ice bag to cool our drinks. If we wanted to put our drinks in the fridge that they had in our room we would also have to pay an additional fee for them to clean the room out. Literally everything was pay to play and I did not like that. On top of that the rooms were decent at best. I checked into another hotel at a similar price point to this one on my last night. That hotel had free self parking and two free water bottles a day. Additionally for nearly the same price we also had a kitchen a living room a separated jacuzzi bathtub and shower and a bedroom. The resort fee at this other hotel was half of what the Mirage was charging as well so I really don't understand why they couldn't include small amenities. I paid over $80 in parking staying at The Mirage for 5 days (yes I was aware that you get charged for every 24 hours you leave your car in the lot). The atmosphere did not make me want to gamble either; so I took my business elsewhere.
20,Went for Big Smoke convention. Room was filthy and after being moved to a suite that room had issues too. When front desk was told of the issue only one issue was taken care of 2 days later. The other issues were never addressed.
50,I just felt the cost for any food is about four times average higher and not quality  the hamburger taste as it was a frozen burger with cheese for a total bill of 50.00  heritage charges for skirt steak is just that
30,The rooms need renovation especially the restroom prior to check in the restroom look like didn’t get cleaned there was hair in the shower and all over the floor and the shower drain was clogged. Over all it’s an average resort.
40,I enjoy my stay but I didn’t like the quality of service when I took part in gambling atmosphere. Drinks are watered down (depending on what you ordered) Rooms are expensive so take advantage of a discounts they may have available
50,Great atmosphere and clean rooms for a good price. The location is perfect. The pool is awesome. This hotel is on the same level of the more expensive ones on the strip but for less money. I would recommend for anymore.
40,Early check in was not as advertised - in fact it wasn't available at all when I arrived. The room I was eventually assigned smelled of water damage and the carpet was sticky. The noise from the attractions outside was deafening at night making it hard to fall asleep.
30,"The location is good especially if you are meeting up at the Bellagio. Not sure what the resort fee covers but you're paying it whether you understand or not. The whole hotel is quite smoky so I am still sick from 2 days' stay. Parts of the casino are ""smoke-free"" but not enforced. The hotel is not enforcing masking so look forward to that. The fitness center opens at 8 so clearly not serving a business-friendly crowd. Our room was okay though it stank of marijuana and provided a view of the Trump hotel (barf). If I were to stay at an MGM property again it would be at the Park MGM which is completely smoke-free even the casino."
50,Stay here often. It’s comfortable clean the restaurants are good staff is friendly. Just wish they had regular mini refrigerators instead of the already stocked ones. If you love anything around in them so you can chill water or ride it triggers a charge that you removed something. That’s my only gripe
50,Casino was very nice and very well maintained The rooms look like they were new brand. My room was a mini suite and I was able to sleep very comfortable. The room was decorate very nice. I would highly
50,Stayed for 3 nights for business room was clean & comfortable. Didn’t need to deal with lobby as I was able to complete my checkin & access room through the app. Slept well. Spacious room with desk mini bar iron board & safe. Used the pool twice very refreshing water & bar service. Many dinning options inside. My bathroom light broke so a technician was sent & got it fixed quickly. For Covid they provided masks & hand sanitizer inside the room as well as various entrances.
40,I am a frequent traveler to Las Vegas and have stayed at several different properties over the past few years. The Mirage is one of my favorites in Vegas. It was nice to see the hotel back to close to normal following Covid. The hotel is clean and the rooms are extremely comfortable. My only hesitation on this last visit concerns the restaurants. The Pantry (my favorite) has limited hours (it used to be open 24 hrs.a day) and Diablo's was also limited in hours and had an extensive wait list. I gave this last visit a 4 star rating simply based on the availability of the restaurants as the hotel and casino were perfect.
40,Rooms are dated staff in certain areas were very surly. Housekeeping barely passed through the room changed bedding and we found cigarette burns on sheets (we don't smoke). Would certainly look elsewhere before booking again.
20,Housekeeping was the only people that asked how we was or asked if we needed anything. I can certainly see why they are selling it. Rooms were very clean . We had volcano view room and you really couldnt watch the volcano because of the lights on the roof shooting up onto your eyes
50,Stayed here on the 24th floor for our honeymoon. View of the strip was excellent as well as the view of the volcano. Staff was very helpful with hotel info and info about the strip. Highly recommend staying here. Room and bathroom was spotless.
30,The hotel rooms are outdated and could be cleaner. The bathroom exhaust fan couldn't exhaust because there was so much dust and lint in it. There was also dust pile up along the top of the bathroom mirror and on top of the pictures. With many choices in Las Vegas I would recommend another resort. Volcano show was pretty cool.
40,I like to stay here because they have the Beatles LOVE show. I have seen it 4 times and I really get a charge out of it. Also it's a medium size casino/hotel so I don't get lost. Any bigger and I get lost and I hate that. Just right.
50,I recommend this hotel establishment for its excellent customer service housekeeping and made sure that guest follows CDC recommendations. The hotel have secured parking area for guests. They provide sanitizers and masks as well
20,Very Smokey. Had to ask to switch rooms because hallway was filled with smoke. Hotel room bathroom was very dirty. I called to front desk to come clean and they never showed up. Iron was broken in room and took almost 24hrs to replace. Did not live up to 4star accommodations.
50,I was there for the Big Smoke conference and really enjoyed my stay. Clean resort ballrooms and especially the bedroom and bathroom. No lingering odor from the smoking conference which was a bonus! Can't beat the location and staff.
40,First thing off this hotel was built in 1989. That being said I think this hotel is in great shape for being that old. I love the theme of the Mirage and the atrium entry is gorgeous as is the giant aquariums behind the check in counter. I found the hotel staff to be very kind and professional. The layout of the hotel isn't as confusing and convoluted as many hotels on the strip. The location of the Mirage is awesome and the tram to TI is a great option for traveling to another property. Caesars is a very short walk as well. The rooms are well appointed clean and nice. I really liked the beds and for my preference for mattress type these were the best I have slept on in a long time. The bathrooms are small and starting to show their age but they are still nice. The pool is nice especially the waterfalls and various areas you can swim around. Their is a European-style topless pool along with a hot tub and plenty of cabanas. The restaurant options are good especially The Still. For a mid-strip hotel this is a great option.
40,We have stayed here many times. Mirage has good shows available good slots a nice casino atmosphere and comfy beds. The entire hotel is always very clean. They give good bonuses to Mlife members. Always get and use your player card at any Vegas hotel to get free offers later. There are multiple restaurants in the hotel including California Kitchen an Italian restaurant the Pantry Diablos Cantina and Snacks. I would recommend Paradise Cafe outside for a limited menu but good food and atmosphere. We do breakfast there. Lower end rooms are fine. Bathrooms are small too small really but negotiable. Suite rooms need to be updated. They are roomy but have an old feeling to them and furniture is very antiquated and I must say uncomfortable for the pricing level. The Center Bar drinks are very expensive too expensive. There are other locations in the hotel to get cheaper drinks so look for them. I love the location. Easy walking access to Harrahs Free tram to Treasure Island easy walk to restaurants and stores in the Linq Hotel area. Pretty easy walk to Caesar's as well. Since I am a Beatles fan I appreciate the Beatle's themed music and hotel theme. Staff friendliness can vary desk to desk sometimes. Never rude but not ALWAYS overly friendly either as they should be but I see this in all of the hotels. People are people. Overall Mirage is not our absolute favorite hotel in Vegas but it is a good one for the pricing level. Have fun!!
50,What you see is what you get from the Mirage! An oasis in the middle of the desert! The grounds are immaculate the pool is gorgeous hotel staff is super friendly the shows the food and the volcano! With so much to do on this iconic strip of Vegas we never felt the need to leave the Mirage! Paradise!
30,If you stay here eat somewhere else. There are better restaurants for quite a bit less. For example breakfast at the Mirage vs. the Venetian very similar meals were half the price at the Venetian and quite a bit better tasting.
30,Having stayed at the Mirage numerous times over the last 20 yrs or so it was our to stay. Our last trip was less then what we were used as everything is so computerized and interaction with staff was so sterile. At one time you could build a relationship with the pit boss for comps or at least a little help getting a show or dinner reservation. They just took your player card and said good luck none of the old time banter that used to make the Mirage a great place to stay. Generational perhaps but the Mirage should work harder to preserve its personal touch with its guests. I would add that breakfast at the Pantry needs some noise reducing efforts. Our second room( floor nine) was much cleaner and the staff there was friendly and professional.
40,Came in to Vegas for an event. Haven’t been in years I was glad I chose the Mirage to stay at. I was very happy with the hotel and staff. I was a little disappointed the buffet wasn’t open. I understand stand the reasons. It wouldn’t affect my choice of hotel for next time.
40,The Mirage was a great place to stay. The front desk and housekeeping were amazing!! The only thing is the bed wasn’t very comfortable. There weren’t any microwaves or room in the refrigerator to store items.
50,The Mirage is located perfectly on the strip. Their friendly staff makes the stay worth it. As soon as you step out of the taxi someone is there greeting you and accommodating you for the entire stay. Highly recommended!!!!
10,The rooms are over priced old and outdated. Tub plug was broken mini bar was equipped with weight sensors and we were charged a small fortune because my kids were picking up the snacks and checking them out… not eating them. Too much smoke to be family friendly. I would not stay here again.
50,The hotel is very inviting clean and comfortable. The staff is very friendly. A wide variety of slots. However the slots were very tight. I didn't see too many people winning jackpots. Overall very nice though.
10,Arrived in my room and staff had wrapped a wash cloth around the shower head to control the leak. The usb capability to charge your cell phone and electronics was broke. When notifying the front desk and asking if someone could bring me a wall charger and invoice my room the desk manager said that they dont do that Again i offered to pay for it just wanted help attaining it.
40,Overall the Mirage is a nice place to stay. The beds are not as luxurious as some other in neighboring casinos but the staff is great and the atmosphere is nice. The food is also great inside of this hotel.
10,"The accommodation was worst  The bath tub had hair  The fridge was locked / locked  The view was terrible  Our original room wasn't ready even after 2 hrs late from the original check out time  They made it seem like we owed them something for accommodating us for giving us a ""better"" room 2 hrs after our check in time"
50,Good trip overall but rooms are a little outdated for the price. Couldn’t use the fridge because they charge u for everything now plus it goes by weight. They shouldn’t fill up the fridge unless requested.
40,I had a great time at the mirage My only complaint was the long check in after a long flight. We waited in line for over 40 minutes before getting our room key. I love the fact I was able to checkout from my tv and drop off the key downstairs
50,We have loved our stay at Mirage. The pool is perfect nice staff lots of food options and it is right in the middle of everything going on. The theatre is nice for shows. Our room was large and nice. The parking was very conveinent. We will stay here again.
30,Easier to navigate than other monster hotels on strip but needs updating. Sports book is tired and the screens are not good by today's standards - walk to Caesar's or go to Circa for real sports book viewing. Rooms are dark and dated. Restaurant choices are limited but plenty within walking distance at Venetian and Caesars.
10,preemptive fire alarm warning at 3:30 am was terrible for sleep had an early AM flight which made my entire day of Travel miserable from the disruption and sleep deprivation  check in so long  only 2 staff.  Concierge and bell desk was great
30,I feel like the last few years that I have been staying at the mirage i think the property has been put on the back burner for upgrades on the rooms and the bath rooms. The beds are wore out and extremely uncomfortable the carpets need a good steam cleaning and some areas need replaced/fixed ripped I understand it’s and older property but it’s an iconic location and has a huge reputation but it definitely needs a budget increase for modifying and upgrading the rooms are priced high and the tables are not cheap to play. I see myself going down to the Bellagio form now on.
50,The Mirage is my favorite Hotel in Vegas starting with the front desk as it has a beautiful fish tank. The Lobby has a done with a Tropical ambient. The Casino is not that big as other Casinos but it does the job the Sports Book to us the best one in Vegas as all of this has a great Vibe. The rooms are awesome there is a smell of clean less and not to mention the beds are the best!! Best sleep I have had in Las Vegas. The Pool area is big with a new bar in it. It’s location is great as it is in the middle of the strip!!  I would totally recommend this Hotel when in Vegas!!
40,First time in a hotel I got it last mins and got a good deal still so figured something was wrong but to my amazement it was a great room I had an good view of the strip just didn't care for the snack' prices
30,FYI beware of the bar in your room because you’ll get charged even if you don’t grab anything! Everything else was okay. I’m wondering if someone is actually going to contact me to get this handled because that’s really uncalled for!
30,This hotel has a grand entrance with an atrium of trees plants and water falls. The pool area is grand with a bar. There is a dolphin and tiger display for a cost. Unfortunately there is no refrigerator or coffee machine in the rooms and the towels had a fowl smell. The beds were clean and comfortable. The halls were very quiet at night which was great. Overall a good hotel.
30,Unlike a lot of hotels in Vegas The Mirage has a great layout open and easy to navigate. Good shows and a really easy walk to the best hotels on the strip. A few issues to be aware of. First the rooms are clean but getting tired. Tile missing in bath. Shower controls stiff and no water pressure. No in-room coffee. Gym doesn’t open till 8. Still a pretty good value and unless you are spending a lot of time in the room (I was on business) these issues may not matter to you.
20,When I first walked into my room there was a huge stain on the carpet. The refrigerator dresser and mirror in the bathroom were all dirty. The view out the window was of a roof top full of air-conditioners that ran all night long. (Noisy)  I wasn't allowed to use the refrigerator in my room because it was full of overpriced things for me to purchase. A usable refrigerator was available for an additional $40.00/ night. RIDICULOUS! I went to have breakfast at The Pantry 2 eggs w/ toast and homefries was $22.00. I won't be going back to Vegas. I'm not rich nor am I an idiot.
30,The rooms are outdated and have very musty smell that cannot be masked. We were told that there are leaking pipes in the infrastructure . Yikes ! The Pool as always is the reason we keep coming back. Cannot be best for ambiance and service.
30,You'd think the resort fees would help keep maintenance up. Some outlets didn't work the bathroom fan as well. Heat made room smell of cigarettes.    The workers were pleasant and courteous.    Too spendy for just sleeping.
40,Things were good once checking in. Checking in rook over an hour and a half because the app wouldn't let me check in. The bathrooms are a bit small but manageable because I was traveling solo. Just left the door open.
30,The Mirage continues to be a beautiful hotel. $18 for a bottle of water in the room is excessive. I think people with rooms at the hotel should have free parking and cheaper valet. And you can’t get free drinks while gambling unless you sign up for a player card disappointing:(
10,Very outdated. Plumbing problems in room. Rooms are small. Staff wasn't very friendly. Casino is old and musty. Food is decent but not all restaurants are open. Lines are crazy long for Starbucks in the AM and for the convenience store in the PM. Several staff members were unfriendly and not helpful. A few were polite and helpful during my last date of stay and during the checkout process.
40,The staff and service is above par but the rooms that are beside the mechanical room should not be used for guest rooms at all. You will not get a good night’s sleep. I feel as though these rooms either need to be placed out of service or offered at a deep discount once it was disclosed about the noise level.
50,Beautiful casino and hotel. Smells amazing like coconut tanning oil inside LOL! Friendly staff and plenty of shops inside. More kid friendly with activities like the dolphin show and the gorgeous pool!
50,Trip was great and the overall service at the Mirage was excellent. From check in to room quality the cab stand and check out I couldn’t ask for a better stay. I would recommend the Mirage for either a personal or business trip.
10,We payed for 2 rooms and both were filthy stank really bad and OUTDATED! Room service was piss poor and super slow!!! Worst hotel ever stayed at in Las Vegas! Also the hotel was the darkest hotel on the strip! It definitely doesn't attract anyone driving through the strip!!!
50,We flew in to see Shim Lin. The experience was amazing. The hotel was great the food was great and the show was not to be believed. We are planning on going back to the Mirage and see the show again. It's a must see!!!
40,We stayed in a hospitality suite which was beautiful and gave us a view of the volcano. There was a problem with our room but it was resolved immediately. Every staffperson we encountered was helpful room service was delicious and delivered quickly.
40,Hotel was great! Only comment has to do with the parking garage. The curb between lanes (up and down ramps) needs to be marked with cone or some type of divider. From the side these curbs look like speed bumps but they aren't. Just like me it looks like a lot of other cars tried to cross them and ended up messing up the bottom of my car. Just a little issue but it would go a long way.
50,rooms nice and clean. dealers friendly restaurants service good. overall experience was good. valet service helpful. I would stay there again. I will be looking for any specials the mirage may offer.
50,Overall I liked the Mirage. I would definitely recommend using the app as opposed to checking in directly with the front desk. The room was nice although we only had a view of the roof. Wifi worked well. The pool area was nice although we went during the off season so it wasn't super crowded the drinks were very expensive though. The restaurants are fairly expensive $18 for a burger but their is a McDonalds and Denny's across the street. Its in a good location as well next to several things. I would stay again for the right price.
10,Check in about 1 AM 55 degrees in room required late night service call. Last day got hot And AC not working. No coffee maker in room coffee vendors not open until 6 AM. No refrigerator in room called desk said I can rent for $35 per day. Room should have these basic necessities. Wife took bottle of water from room $18. Hotel is so concerned about Max profits they ruined our trip!!
30,Glad to be back to Las Vegas but I wish they spent the downtime to spruce the place up a bit age is showing. Elevator walls were really dirty on floors 17 - 21. Rooms were clean but showing their age.
50,Wonderful stay at the Mirage! Staff was always friendly and helpful. At check in they asked our preference whether close to elevators or a quieter  mid-floor room. We took the quieter and heard absolutely no noise.  Beds were comfortable bath was well stocked with toiletries selection of places to eat were plentiful. Would stay again!!!
50,We had a great time at the Mirage. Love their casual restaurants for a few quick bites. Plenty of choices. Casino is great. Location is close to other properties and the property is beautiful. Our room was very nice. Just wished there was a fridge to use. The fridge in the room is filled with snacks and drinks got purchase and you can’t move them or take them out without purchasing them.
50,Never stay there before and we were very impressed. Very clean friendly and helpful staff. Casino and restaurants really great. Easy access to parking. Mask and hand sanitizer stations handy Will stay there again highly recommended
50,Staff at front desk and restaurant’s were excellent. Very clean rooms . We will definitely stay there again. Casino very clean. Food was excellent also we ate every meal there but one in six days.  Highly recommend
20,The Pantry restaurant was way over priced for the subpar food. The toilet was too low and the walls were paper thin. The Pool staff was awesome and shout out to Heather for making sure our drinks were always full. I would not recommend staying or eating at the Mirage unless you spend the whole time at the awesome pools.
20,Rooms were old and the furniture was dirty. Was charged a resort fee of $44 after booking and only found out about it after we arrived at the hotel. It was not worth the price. Take your money elsewhere. The mirage is NOT nice but they charge you as if it is upscale.
50,Fantastic staff. Great and comfortable room. Restaurants were filled with great wait staff and exceptional food! Can’t wait to go again! Made a little money and staffing was filled with great servers and machine attendants!
50,While there is a line to check in ( no automatic check in without app) the process was smooth the rooms are spacious and clean when a quiet room requested received one on the end; the staff were friendly and were able to answer our questions. The only potential draw back i not in the middle of the srop but more towards the end.
50,They were very nice rooms and the staff was courteous and friendly. Definitely recommend and will be back. The hotel is centrally located and other casinos and restaurants are within walking distance of hotel.
50,Love the Mirage location. The monorail is across the street which make it convenient to get to other end of the strip. Easy walking to many other casinos.  Love the staff @ Mirage. Always friendly and helpful. Really like the assortment of restaurants my favorite is Snacks!
40,We were pleased with this hotel. It was our first time staying here and it was worth it. Very clean smelled good felt safe with security on the floors. Need a key to go use the elevators.My only reservation was the parking fee. After paying for resort fees we should not be charge to park.
50,Great accommodations - Casino fun to play. Miss the volcano. Food was good do miss the buffet.Overall the visit was very good and we look forward to retuning soon to Vegas and to other MGM properties.
30,First of all am sure that Covid-19 had a big influence on the Average rating. While traveling for a conference recently I had the opportunity to stay at the Mirage. I have always enjoyed the Mirage typically. I do not want to diminish the Hotel and Casino overall but it was very unfortunate that several of the restaurants were not open early in the week. I ate Mexican two evenings in a row at the Hotel El Diablo I believe (I like Mexican food and the food was great) but other options were limited. The rest of the stay was enjoyable but if you think you have options to eat during the week you may be challenged.
40,This was my second stay at The Mirage and I enjoyed it again. We dined at Osteria Costa as well as Stack and were delighted by both. There was a large water stain in our bathtub and the a/c didn’t cool well at night (we did not call for help) but everything else was wonderful. The beds were comfortable and the location is great. I spent time at the pool and very much enjoyed my time there. It’s a very large pool with several sections. More than enough room for a lot of people to be comfortable and the drinks from the bar were great. I’d stay there again.
50,The mirage I have visited and loved since 1993 is alive and well. I will be back in March. Keep up the good work. House keeping was excellent food services in most cases very timely with the exception of a few small eateries under staffed.
50,Had a wonderful stay. The room and staff were great. We ate at all the restaurants which didn't disappoint. They have the Volcano and a tram to TI. Loved the Beatles Love show. Also easy access to the monorail. Would stay there again.
50,Mirage is always the best Food Gaming and shows. The friendliest people work there always smile and willing to help. I stayed Mirage over the last 7 years never complaint . M Life is a big plus I have not had to pay for room food and lots of free play
50,Great resort cleanliness was amazing lots of great food choices lots of things to do perfect location lots of excitement workers were very friendly loved playing the slots there definitely one if the better resorts out there and I've stayed in plenty . Mirage is where I will be staying from here on out
40,I recommend the Stay Well rooms. Air filtration and hypo-allergenic sheets. I could breathe a lot easier! Great for non-smokers! Limited restaurant selection due to COVID-19 restrictions. Massage therapist and pool staff were great!
50,We were very surprised to receive an upgraded room when we arrived for check-in. We stayed in a suite on one of the top floors. It was lovely and very spacious. The room had a bedroom area living room area and 2 complete bathrooms! So much space! My only negative would be the price of beverages and snacks in the room. My husband grabbed a water bottle and we were shocked it costs over $20!
50,The staff at the front desk were absolutely remarkable. I told them it was my 22nd Anniversary and they made sure I had a room with a spectacular view. They put us up in a room that overlooked the strip and Volcano show. The experience was so amazing that we look forward to staying at the Mirage again .
50,First time at the Mirage but I would recommend and go back! Fun atmosphere and a lot to do nearby. Saw the Beatles Love show and it was very good too. Food at the Mirage was decent and accessible. Room rate was reasonable overall.
50,My wife and I have stayed at the mirage for over 20 years. We don’t even think of anywhere else to stay. The staff is great the hotel is well kept and it is centrally located on Las Vegas blvd. The price is right and the restaurants are great.
50,The Mirage was just a great hotel to stay in. It was clean bright and inviting. I will definitely stay there again! We went as couples and got two rooms. We were able to check in as soon as we hit the airport and room was ready for us instantly.
50,When I arrived I was told the room I booked was not available and they had a different room with two Queen beds. Because of the inconvenience the front desk clerk made it right for me even though I didn’t have an issue. She went above and beyond and was very helpful. The room was spacious and clean with everything available for me. They provided masks and hand sanitizer as well. I will definitely stay at the Mirage again!
40,First time staying at Mirage....had a great time great location nice amenities great people and atmosphere. Bathroom tub/shower was a little dated. Good choice of places to eat. Would stay here again!!!
50,Mgr. was very attentive to us. The Server was 100% . I had one of the finest steaks I've ever had.    Couldn't have been treated better. Gen. Mgr. kept on top of our satisfaction with the meal service and all other aspects of our experience.
50,We enjoyed our two night stay at your resort for my husband's birthday.  Rooms were nice very clean. Food was good at your restaurants. Did enjoy some gambling. $10 tables were a little high not what we are used to. $5 is more reasonable. So did less gambling than normal. Front desk people were good and the one who checked us in actually waived our parking fee as we had some confusion with the parking.
40,I like the location and general atmosphere of The Mirage. Check-in at the front desk was fast (at around 7:30 pm on a Sunday). My room was quiet; the bed was comfortable. I wish there was a mini-fridge for storing my own items instead of the mini-bar. The bathroom in the standard entry-level room is very small but is useable for one person.    For a 30 year old property The Mirage is well maintained although the rooms are past due for a refresh. I miss the buffet.
50,Awesome time was had. The hotel was clean and welcoming upon arrival. We were given a room with a nice view of the strip. Our room was spotless. The mini bar while we didnt use anything from it was fully stocked which hasnt always been the case at other properties. Will stay here again for sure!
50,Had a very nice stay everyone who works there was friendly and knowledgeable. Very nice sports book. Food was excellent but getting very pricey drinks also. We enjoy the slots and look forward every year for this trip.
40,our staycation was okay there but we didnt have a place for food so that was good and things were high priced. but we were ok we went to the dolphin exhibit and walked around. and the bathroom in our room wasnt accessible so i couldnt use it at all... we asked for a accessible room looking at the volcano which we couldnt see from being on the 20th floor.
50,Definitely going to stay at the mirage again! Everywhere you went in the hotel it was clean and it even smelled good! Looking forward to staying there again and winning big! The restaurants were pricey but they are everywhere.
50,definitely will stay at the Mirage again beautiful pool I got to have breakfast by the pool good restaurants and good location we didn’t have to leave the hotel to get breakfast or dinner. room are clean comfy bed and beautiful view
30,My first and last stay at the Mirage. At least I gave it a try but small dingy room and poor staff attitude will probably prevent me from staying there again. As always I had fun on the slots (but not one waitress) and the deli food was delicious.
50,Excellent staff to accommodate what we needed.. we just plan to have the bags held until check in and go lay at the pool but this wonderful staff gave us a penthouse suite as a courtesy so we could enjoy our day better
50,The staff was professional welcoming and very friendly. Rooms were modernized clean and super cozy. The slots also treated me pretty well. The last week I've stayed at MGM MIRAGE ARTISAN DELANO MANDALAY BAY VDARA AND LUXOR. Out of them all I recommend Mirage for overall best experience. Definitely has a relaxed and exotic vibe to it.
30,The hotel’s location is great. Walking distance to a lot of entertainment and food. Friendly staff. Prompt housekeeping. Easy check in process. Bed is comfortable but Moisture issues in room on ceiling. Not my first stay there so what I can say is it may not be the norm but I will be looking into other options for future Vegas stays.
40,Place was nice and clean. We saw the Beatles show that was exceptional. A few areas with room for improvement would be. Beds were too hard. My wife kept getting woken up by drunk people in the hallway (not sure you could fix that. It is Vegas after all) blackjack paid 6:5.
10,The Mirage is not the place to stay...From the online check in process to room initially given to trying to change room to seeing rats by the pool area to attitude of the staff at pools to paying for chairs and seats by the pool and the list goes on.    look elsewhere to stay in Vegas
20,The public areas of the resort are well maintained but the hotel room was disappointing. The upholstery needs cleaned/replaced as well as the carpets  The bathroom ceiling and shower were both in need of repair.  The pool and cabanas are great.
20,We had lunch in the pool side cafe and then found a pair of lounge chairs by around 2:00 PM. By 3:00 PM the sun was no longer shining in that area so we moved across to the other side of the pool where there were better quality padded lounge chairs. Within five minutes an employee came by and ordered us to either leave or pay her an extra $59 per chair. As we already are paying $150 / night plus another $45 in a resort fee that includes use of the pool and pool side chairs this appears to be a very greedy policy. We requested to remain there at no extra charge especially since there would only be another half hour or so of direct sun in that location but were told to pay or move elsewhere. We went back to our room as there were no other chairs left in the direct sunlight. Very cheap and greedy policy by the Mirage.
10,Rooms need to be updated majority of restaurants were closed security thinks they are homeland. If you are staying in their hotel you can’t dress up in a Halloween costume and walk to ride share since you have to walk through the casino. Bad experience all around.
40,Vegas was crowded and expensive. The Mirage is a great value for the price although other Hotels are nicer. We had no complaints had to leave a day early and they credited the night in short notice. The pool is is the best! Tropical and a great vibe!
40,It was very difficult to get dinner reservations.  Apparently the minibar wasn't completely stocked which I don't care about as I don't use it. However because of this miss I was wrongfully charged for every minibar item that wasn't stocked. This incurred a bill of over $120.00. While I appreciate that these items were removed from the bill I didn't appreciate having to go and prove my case.  The floors were dirty under every surface and the closet smelled like smoke.....  The tub had old soap in the drain but that isn't the reason for the clogging.... gross.  Crunchy hand towels with body hair were forgotten on the shower rod.  All in all everything turned out good and I made it home safe. Cheers
20,Housekeeping cleaning loudly and vacuuming (room next door). Vaccuuming and talking loudly in the hall on our floor at 330-430am. Called front desk to report.    Drink fridge has to be unlocked (by front desk) in order to use. After first night I saw a $15 (plus tax) alcohol. I never asked for the fridge to be unlocked it was always locked but still charged. Thankfully charged was reversed when I called front desk.  Checked-in at 1030pm on app (time saver) room info was provided went up and housekeeping was cleaning room.    During morning of check-out housekeeping started opening door (didn't knock) at 830am. I let her know I was leaving in 30 mins. She came back 10 mins later opening the door again without knocking. I was not checked out and it was well before 11am. I went out to the hall and let her know I was leaving shortly and she apologized.
50,Love staying here! Will continue to come back! The heritage is a great place to eat. Sports book is one of the best in Vegas. Everyone is extremely helpful! Rooms were taken care of and cleaned very well every day!!!
20,Honestly I would not recommend The Mirage. It has affordable pricing and spacious rooms. However the cleanliness of the rooms takes away those pros for me. Bedding was dirty we found 2 roaches in our room. One dead and one alive. Carpet is dirty and looks like it has not been vacuumed. Showers need an update desperately the heads are all corroded for the shower and sink. When we found the roaches we called down to the front desk and the woman did not apologize and acted like what did we want her to do about it. After waiting for her to make a phone call MGM said they are required to give us a room change. It was about a 2 hour process to change rooms with the room keys not working. We never received one apology for any of the occurrences. We will definitely find somewhere else to stay on our next stay in Vegas.
50,Had a great 3 day weekend at this casino with my friends. I will definitely be staying here my next trip to Vegas. There’s a lot of great casinos on the strip but this was my favorite hands down. Great dealers very friendly.
50,Always love the Mirage! Great employees ( from Sam at Heritage to Sharon on the cocktails to Scott Poster helping with room/slot tourney/etc) everything was great. Only complaint is your slot machines TOO tight and literally saw no-one winning big for three days straight. Bummer. But staff and grounds are excellent!
30,Room was dated smelled musty and the mattress was extremely soft and broken down. Room change request was denied until 3rd night of 5 night stay due to occupancy levels but housekeeping did change the mattress and tried to mask the musty odor with a deodorizing agent. Other members of our group experienced the same room quality issues. Each member of the Mirage staff was understanding of the issues and helped to try and compensate for the inconvenience. Unfortunately the rooms are becoming very worn and are in need of updating.
50,Great location and excellent resort considering how old the property is. The pool was heated and not overly crowded. The buffet was still closed but there are plenty of dining options available within walking distance. Would recommend this resort to everyone.
50,"Honestly there are nicer places to stay on the strip. However the Mirage is by far the best bang for you're buck in the whole city. It has the best location on strip. ""South of the crystal shops has gotten a bit shady at night especially for women."" It has a top pool in the city and amazing attractions throughout the resort. The atmosphere is one of a kind classy but lively. It's nice to dress up throughout the day but not feel judged looking like a slob at 8 am. Finally it has the most amazing staff. Unfortunately lost my keys on my final night and the hotel was able to track them down though outstanding communication. Sadly they are booked for my next trip in December. However I can not wait to pay The Mirage another visit."
50,The hotel was awesome the staff is incredible and the restaurant are great. Great pools and the volcano show is awesome to see and the secret garden is wonderful I recommend all to go and see it you will be amazed.
20,We have visited Las Vegas every year since 1990 sometimes several times a year. My husband and I have traveled to Vegas specifically on our anniversary in October since 1998. We also visited Vegas 8 times in 2019. We’ve only missed traveling to anywhere in 2020. I had knee surgery in 2018 and several more on the same knee within 2 years. When visiting Las Vegas I have been able to rent a mobility scooter right on property but the trip in October we were told that we could rent a scooter but could only use it on their property (The Mirage)! This was my first time staying and The Mirage and definitely my last! Hotels should be accommodating to their guests but I assume we have the pandemic to blame like everything else!! We typically stay at MLife properties and sometimes Total Rewards properties. Not sure why this last visit totally missed the mark with us!
50,The day of check cleaning walked in at 8:55 am without knocking. As I stood there with no pants on she asked when we would leave. I freaked out because I thought check was 11am and that we had overstayed. It really was 11am they just wanted us out right then. She kept our door open as I dressed and scrammbled to put all my stuff in my bags. We were out by 9:05 and they never once left our room while we packed. Never staying again and even if you put the do not disturb sign on they still walk in and don’t care if you’re naked either
40,The Mirage continues to keep on keeping on. New restaurants to choose from updated rooms and it's in a great location on the strip. I continue wish they would update or upgrade the sports book televisions. Very old technology.
50,The front desk staff was very nice and helpful when checking in the room was clean and the valet was very quick to bring the car. I had asked for extra towels and they brought the towels to my room pretty quick.
40,We had a great experience at The Mirage even though there were limited dining options. Slots and virtual games were plentiful. It’s sad to see so little human interaction at craps or card games. I guess virtual is the new way to play. The hotel although ageing is still pretty and clean. The bathrooms could use updating however. No one takes a bath anymore. LOL
10,Our bathroom in our hotel room was not at all clean. There was hair in the sink and on the counter and floor including long strands and small shaved pieces. The mirror and floor were also dirty. So disappointing.
50,I don’t know about staff because we didn’t talk to anyone there but everything was great. Very clean very nice casino. Room was nice and clean. View was okay. Would stay again and or recommend to friends and family.
50,Loved my visit to the Mirage! It was my first time in Vegas and the staff were so friendly and helpful. In particular the bartenders and front desk staff were excellent. If there was any complaint at all it was that the walls in my room seemed a bit thin since I could hear my neighbors speaking at a pretty casual volume. But seeing as how I was barely in my room it didn’t bother me much. Can’t wait to visit again!
50,This was our first stay at the Mirage. We will definitely revisit. The Stay Well rooms were great the location to access things in the hotel were convenient. The Paradise Cafe by the pool was a great place for lunch and we opted in to have a Mexican night at Diablos Cantina. You will not be disappointed.
50,Stayed last week Oct. 2021 room super clean and house keeping very timely in upkeep everything in room functioned properly. Pool and waitresses perfect. Shim Lim and Connor McCloud show first rate with comfortable remodeled theater. Casino well run and clean and not run down. Casino Bar and waitresses perfect nice place to drink. The Still also well run and good drinks and food. Open Pantry good breakfasts as well as the muffin place near pool. Really good experience overall and masks worn by most people on the premises.
10,What a horrible experience. Homeless people digging through trash and slot machines in the casino and common areas of the hotel for unfinished drinks and cigarettes grungy rooms and disconnected customer service. Not only will I never stay at the Mirage again but if I'm ever in Las Vegas again I will avoid walking by the Mirage.
10,Just spent the worst night here. When we checked into our room yesterday there was a terrible musty moldy smell. We called to change rooms and nothing was available. Opening the window and turning on the bathroom fan did not change the stench at all.    Now that I know of this issue I did a search of “musty” and this issue has been going on here for years with no resolution. I find this unbelievable. From reading the reviews it’s a complete crap shoot if you’ll get one of the musty moldy rooms (could even be a Stay Well room).    So The Mirage and MGM are quite aware of this issue and for whatever reason aren’t dealing with it.    I’m so happy to be leaving this room - yuck! The Mirage please don’t bother replying to this review; I’ve seen your replies to others that have had the same complaint of a musty moldy room over the years. In your reply you don’t validate that your hotel has this issue; I’m not interested in your standard apology reply that doesn’t discuss this known issue.    I hope our experience here will help others avoid this place! There are so many other quality places to stay here in Las Vegas.
50,It's been a long time since I stayed at Mirage and I will be going back very soon.  The Staff was very friendly and made the stay even better. We loved all the ranges of different restaurants under one roof.  Best pool on the Strip IMHO
50,They always go above and beyond if we have any issues they are handled promptly. But we have never had an issue when staying here. They give you what they say and sometimes they give you more than you expected.
30,They wanted me to wait 2 1/2 hours for a room when I checked in through the app the night before. I got to hotel at 2 and did not get a room til 4. That’s only because I complain because the wanted me to wait another hour and a half! They also charge u and extra $300 at check in. You will also see charges that don’t make sense on your bill. This place just wants your money.
40,Hotel is beautiful room was dingy and small and dated. Couldn’t put your own stuff in the mini fridge it was packed with expensive mini bar items and would charge you a restocking fee if anything was moved. Shower was small although did have a seat that pulled down for those who needed it. Bed was firm sheets nice and soft could have used an extra blanket. Everything was clean just seemed very dated for such a nice hotel. The dolphins were extraordinary would recommend to everyone to see the secrecy garden. Pool is beautiful.
50,Chose this property initially due to an American Express points option. Was very satisfied with proximity To other venues food choices live entertainment spa services. The only portion I did not like was low water pressure for the showers not the highest quality of shampoo and conditioners in the rooms.
50,Very clean nice staff rooms were beautiful! Will stay there again! Property was gorgous and very nicely maintained! Loved the Aquarium Very soothing. Close to all the attractions not far to walk for anything.
50,We did online check in and it was not only easy but didn’t have to wait in any lines once we arrived. We were able to make our own hotel cards or use mobile keys. The rooms were clean and comfortable. We ate at the California pizza restaurant. The food was delicious and the service was wonderful.
40,The casino is centrally-located and the staff is friendly the pool and grounds well-kept but the carpets in the hallways and rooms need replacing or a good cleaning. The hallways smell like the a wet dog.
50,Went for a Eagles trip great location and casino. Everything was great at The Mirage. We had good food and great service. Enjoyed playing the slots there and the atmosphere was great. would definetly stay there again.
30,This was my second time staying at this property first stay was great but the second time the room that I was placed in ruined it for me. Dirty walls carpet holes older shower with small bathroom. Doesn’t feel like a MGM property but decent hotel.
20,The room was not clean. We went without water and missed a reservation and the floor was soaked from the air conditioner. The check in and out lines were ridiculously long but the ladies at the desk were extremely nice.
40,"Updated room on 25th floor Tower...nice view of The Strip...easy mobile check-in and digital key...best spot on The Strip...  Now get rid of those disgusting smokers (marijuana smell on no smoking floor) and get rid of that nickel and dime ""Resort Fee"" and that nickel and dime parking fee..."
10,I’m an MLIFE Platinum member and use to always stay at the Mirage before discovering luxury at the Venetian. My visit at the Mirage this time was by far my worst: roaches in the bathroom connecting suite doors locked elevators not working when trying to get to the airport fridge dirty with used bottles.
30,The best thing about this destination is location other than that just an average hotel/casino. Rooms while comfortable are dated with little to no amenities. Better gaming experience offered at other properties.
50,My wife and I came to Las Vegas to see the Beatles Love show at the Mirage. So we decided to stay here for convenience. This was our first time staying here. Check-in was quick and easy. We were assigned a very nice room on the 24th floor with a view of the volcano and Las Vegas Blvd. The room appeared recently updated. Really nice and clean. No odd smells or dust. The 24th floor was very quiet. We slept well. The only issue during our 2 night stay was the shower. The showerhead shot out a powerful blast of water. Too powerful for the size of the shower stall. No way to adjust the pressure. Water got everywhere..even on the floor.    Like any other hotel casino in Vegas masks are mandatory. All staff was masked and most guests. There are plenty of restaurants bars and cafes to choose from. We enjoyed the food and drink and had a fun time here . This hotel casino is in a great location. We will stay here again.
50,Love the Mirage always have always will. It’s a great place to stay. The hotel is near plenty of attractions. The view is gorgeous of the skyline at night with all the beautiful lights. The food at the Pantry is delish. Also Heritage Steakhouse the best.
30,Out of the 12 people in our group only 3 people received a single drink on the casino floor during our 6 day stay. They got bloody Mary’s at 7am. Any other time you couldn’t find a waitress anywhere.  Don’t waste your money on early check in. The only one of our group to purchase the early check in was the last to receive their room.
50,The Mirage Resort is on a perfect location on the Strip. Nearby many entertainment restaurants and nightlife places. Our stay there was awesome. Comfortable beds clean rooms great views (if on higher floors) and very comfortable stay overall. Family friendly resort with entertainment and restaurants. Tip: Ride the trams!
50,Penthouse was great! Amazing views. If you are cold natured just asked for extra blankets. Pantry unfortunately wasn’t open 24 hours as expected. But we found good at Walgreens across the street. Great stay. Will return soon.
50,I love Vegas! The Mirage is my favorite! I’ve stayed at all the hotels on the strip and The mirage is my go to! The pool is so relaxing! I love the waterfall! It’s not a crazy party pool. I went for my 40th birthday and had the best time! Can’t wait to return!!!
20,Mirage is starting to show its age. Our room smelled moldy/mildew right away. We opened the window & came back 2 hrs later still smelled. Called to see if we could change rooms & nope they were all full. They sent someone to spray a bunch of Frebreeze which helped cover it up but returned quickly. Got up early the next day & left ASAP.
50,Even after 32 years the Mirage is still one of the best hotels in Las Vegas. Great location value pool and casino. Friendly staff from check in to check out. From exquisite dining to snack bar sports betting slots and table games the the Mirage is still our favorite after 32 years.
50,Very clean. Great staff and location is perfect. We had a great experience. Lots of restaurants close by and the bus stop is right our front. . Always staff around willing to answer questions and help if needed.
50,Everything was a very smooth process. The room was nice and clean. The food was great and check out was just as smooth as check in. I went for a birthday party and all 20 of us got rooms at the mirage.
40,Other than no ice machine working on my floor great stay and having to get an extra keycard to get on another floor. Will for sure stay here again very soon and can't wait! Pool area was large with plenty of space.
40,I LOVE this hotel!!! I hate the poker room is gone and one oak night club closed. The location is great and it’s easy to get anywhere on the strip. I highly recommend mobile check in because the line to check in can get long at times.
50,Friendly service at restaurants and check in. Lots of slots I'd never played before. Location was a big factor in choosing where to stay. Best birthday I've had in some time. Hope to do it again soon!
40,Love our luggage / bell hop experience William was exceptional. Our person at the front desk was so nice and went out of her way to make it an easy experience. Non smoking section closed to prepare for a tournament didn't care for their selection of slot machines. Had to wait too long for drinks when playing slots and twice had to hunt someone down after playing for 20 minutes with one in sight.
50,For the money this was the best stay. Rooms were lux and super clean. Staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Highly recommend. Location was close to all of the major attractions. The resort grounds were beautiful. Loved it!
40,While staying at the Mirage we encountered a domestic dispute. The security staff was so prompt in their response time that our party was put at ease. Check in was a breeze and all of the service was excellent.
20,Numerous issues with Mirage. Hotel overbooked and over-sold rooms and my room type that I booked was not available at check in. I was told I could move rooms the next day which is a hassle in itself. In the 10+ years of staying at mirage I’ve had to move rooms for some reason or another every stay. Check-in line is long and slow process and if you have an issue after checking in during your stay you have to stand in this giant line again to speak to someone. Half the restaurants are not open. Rooms are in poor repair. We had water or some sort of liquid dripping through our bathroom ceiling for 2 days. Video poker machines are old and dated. Food prices are expensive. Lots of slamming doors at night.
10,First time staying at an MGM resort/hotel and I will never stay again. Parking is no longer included in the resort fee which is a massive rip off I don't even know what the resort fee does. Most hotels in Vegas still include parking. Everything is extremely overpriced 2 drinks was $40. Food choices were junk and overpriced. The hotel is outdated the bathroom is small and old. I will only be staying at Caesar's resorts going forward.
50,I’ve been here numerous times. I’ve enjoyed coming staying here. I love the energy friendliness and vibe. Feels good to come to a clean room. They take COVID precautions seriously and make sure staff are wearing their masks. Locations for masks are visible.
20,Upon arrival  the room looked clean and I use that term loosely. There was hair around the toilet and MOLD in the shower. During my 2 day 2 night stay I only used the shower one time and washed up in the bathroom sink. Outside the front of the hotel by the fire show there’s rats running around. And I will definitely NOT BE BACK to the Mirage.
40,This is an older hotel but it seems as new and is extremely clean and staffed with great friendly and helpful people in all depatments including house-keeping customer service bars gaming and valet. I will be coming back for another fun and great experience!!
30,The good - Tower king room and bathroom was nice comfortable open and had a great view of the strip pool and mountains. It was quiet without any disturbance. The casino was great. Food at The Stack was amazing.    The bad - You are not allowed to use a luggage cart essentially being forced to use a bag claim clerk to assist and take away your bags. You must then wait another 30-45 minutes for them to transport to the room once you get there and call (I was on hold for about 20 minutes) and feel obligated to tip them twice. There were 2 small areas of blood noticed in the shower and bathroom floor.    Overall - average experience.
50,Check in process was a breeze. The room was very clean and had an excellent view of the street and the Volcano.  The food was excellent. It was cook to my liking. Has a very relaxing time at the pool and the jacuzzi made it perfect. Had enjoyed playing at the casino with friends. I had stayed In different hotels in Vegas. But my last four trip to Vegas I stayed at the Mirage.
40,Clean motel with nice rooms however if you drive or have a rental car prepare to pay everytime your car leaves the parking garage. Not the case with competitors nearby for around the same price mattress is SUPER hard!
50,Everything and everyone were perfect. Definitely returning to the mirage. My family and I were happy with all the services and how kind the staff members are. The pantry and the still were delicious. PERFECT!
50,Definitely had an amazing stay definitely willing to book a stay again in future all the workers here are all so nice it was swell to have some good talks with some good people crazy how COVID took a stir into things
50,Vegas experience was awesome with MGM properties and specifically the stay at the Mirage the Spa and Mayfair experience at the Bellagio and the food at Bevettes in Park MGM....World Class! Will be back soon.
40,The bed is super comfortable. I would sleep in the bed all day if I could. I’m happy there is a Starbucks inside the hotel very convenient for my coffee drinkers and the front desk fish tank  is really cool.
50,Mirage is in the best location on the Las Vegas strip. Near Treasure Island. Venetian Palazzo. Wynn's and Encore. Fashion Mall is close by too with hundreds of shops restaurants and major department stores..
50,Great service. Clean room albeit a little dated but great value. Loved multiple options to check in and out. Location was ideal for my conference. Bell stand service was exceptional. Food options available.
50,Excellent visit to The Mirage during MJBiz Con. Everything was smooth from checkin to restaurant reservations to having everything I need at my finger tips. Great hotel with prompt service when needed.
50,I have been traveling to Las Vegas once a year for the past 10 years and always stay at the Mirage. It is centrally located on the strip and the hotel is always clean and the staff friendly. I love the restaurants there - California Pizza Kitchen The Pantry Blizz The Roasted Bean and Starbucks. Love the Mirage Pool also.!
10,"Before you decide to book a room at this hotel know that their parking garage is not safe. My car was vandalized in their parking garage in section 4D. After filing a report with security and letting management know about it Leslie in their Risk Management Department claims that the hotel is not responsible for any damage to your vehicle even though you're paying for your car to be parked in their garage. She quoted ""NRS 487.038: ""Authority of owner or person in lawful possession of real property to have towed therefrom vehicle parked in unauthorized manner: Oral notice to local law enforcement agency required; exceptions to authority; residential real property; costs to be borne by owner of vehicle; other rights and remedies; voluntary payment to tow operator or abandoned vehicle."" This code does not apply to my circumstances whatsoever and this lady is clearly a liability to this company especially since she's 100% wrong. I would expect a place like Motel 6 to try and weasel their way out of something like this but MGM (Mirage) to not do a damn thing is enough for me to make sure people know about this. We're never staying here again."
10,The rooms were very outdated. The carpet was dirty there was no electrical outlets for bedside use and our room was not cleaned one day during the stay. During our stay there was three times where no taxis were readily available including our departure to the airport.
50,We stayed at the Mirage for 8 days it was the best vacation by far. The staff were very friendly and courteous. I highly recommend this hotel. We will definitely be staying here again. Can't say enough good things about this resort!
30,Location is great but the offering in the hotel is average. Nothing exceptional that I found. Two of the main restaurants were closed so the others were crowded. It was always excessively noisy so it's not a restful place. Prices might be average for the location but egregious for an average hotel. Check in was bad the staff seemed uninterested in the growing line of people waiting.
50,This property is spotless and the service is impeccable. It's an older property but very comfortable. We ate at 3 of the restaurants and they were all very reasonably priced. The pool area and restaurant are both very nice.
30,I go to Vegas for the Sports Book and sometimes stay at Mirage. Your sports book is very inviting but some are nicer Wynn and Bellagio is close by so its a good location. The attention to Horseracing at your sportsbook is good. The personnel at the sports book are very accommodating
20,Mold in the bathrooms marijuana wafting through the air vents and broken features in the rooms. This was my second stay at the Mirage and it has definitely not lived up to my previous experience. The quality of the hotel no longer lives up to the cost of staying here.
40,Mirage was in a very ideal location but the rooms and aesthetic were a bit dated and stained. I would like an outlet close to the bed as well it was difficult to charge my phone at night. However it was an over good time.
20,The room smelled horrible! Called to request a move but would not accomodate because they were booked. The furniture is old and dirty rooms are in desperate need of remodeling. Do not recommend staying here.
30,Location is good but the hotel needs an update. The first day we had to call down for housekeeping to replace our shower head. The room was clean but outdated and needs the USB ports replaced as they are loose and so are the plug-ins. There was nowhere near the bed to charge a phone without pulling out the nightstands.
50,My favorite hotel & casino in Las Vegas. I only wish have a Mirage Resort and Casino in Atlantic City!!! New Jersey needs a Mirage.  I will be back! Keep up the good work at this resort MGM.  I love the Mirage so much.
10,Booked here for our wedding getaway. Room was decent but ended up paying extra for a view we didn’t get. Really bad part was No waitresses in the casino so you had to get your own drinks oh and pay for them…in Vegas. $30 for 2 drinks after you left you table or machine.
10,We made a reservation only to have it given away.  Manager at 5am tells us to find another hotel instead of helping accommodate us for their mistake.  Extremely Rude Managers  Very Condescending  StayAway
50,Clean rooms. Excellent restaurants with fantastic service and food.  Fun casino. Fantastic pool area. Service at the bars and on the casino floor is fast and the servers are pleasant and helpful. We recommend a stay at the Mirage.
30,Illegal non-venting fans in the bathrooms made wet air in the room constantly. Sticky and gross. Food at the pantry was fair. The in room bars are robbery and trick you into spending money. They know it is a scam. Did not get the room we booked on the first night and it was terrible.
40,It's been a few years since I've stayed here but I was pleasantly surprised. Mot things were updated. The restaurants were superb with a great variety to choose from. All accessible and easy to walk up for a rez. Very clean and friendly all around.
30,Walls paper thin and you could hear the people in the next room. Room was nice but we could hear the neighbors and they kept us up until 3:30 am!! Slots rarely paid off--don't gamble here!! Arrived at 6:45 pm on a Tuesday night and had to wait in line for 25 minutes to check in. Only 2 employees working the desk!
50,Other than elevator noise. It was great. Nice casino great staff. What else do you want . Great service clean rooms. But putting use next to elevator was bad news . I had to put cotton balls in ears to try to sleep.
40,4 nights at the Mirage. Great location on the Strip. Easy walk to adjacent properties. Breakfast was terriffic at The Pantry. If you are looking for an MGM property that is not to large this is your place.
50,We had a great time. Love the Hotel/Casino. Nice an close to Walgreens which is nice to buy your odds and ends. The staff was great room was nice and clean. Our Host went over and beyond to make us feel welcomed.
50,Hotel was beautiful inside. Loved the plants and water. Pet friendly. Beautiful pool area. Great shows and Beatles shop. Lived the friendly staff and that it didn’t smell of smoke even though it’s smoking in the casino
50,Mirage is clean and updated. Awesome staff who are all happy to be back to work. Marco the bartender at Diablos Cantina in the Mirage ensures great drinks while enjoying their fantastic food like my favorite->chicken tinga enchiladas.
50,My first time in Vegas and my trip was AMAZING. Mostly because of the service and cleanliness of the Mirage. The mirage was very welcoming. Everything was easy to find. The pool was big and beautiful and the service out there was just as amazing. and I will stay there every time I go to Vegas.
40,The room was spacious and spotlessly clean. I thought food was outrageously priced. $68 for breakfast for two is a little much. Also the was not a plug anywhere near the bed. Since I use my phone for an alarm and my entertainment I was irritated.
20,The rooms of this great property are horrible. They are dusty dirty old rooms beds curtains and carpet like an old house where the owners just cannot keep them up anymore. Such a shame. The rooms make the entire stay not worth it. I slept in sweats and long sleeves because nothing felt clean. Everything was worn. The curtains are tan from dust dirt and age. This place needs a makeover quick.
20,We were so disappointed by the state of our hotel room. We have stayed at the Mirage at least 6 times previously but after a couple of years away it seems badly cared for. We won't return. Especially upsetting because the rates this weekend 10/22-10/25 were ridiculously high.
40,I spent one night of my stay in a standard double room and then three nights in a Resort Tower King. Both rooms were clean and comfortable (but on the small side) but I found the resort tower room to be worth the upgrade. It has a larger bathroom but more importantly the resort tower floors have two dedicated elevators so regardless of how busy the hotel was I never had to wait for an elevator. I actually preferred the view of the mountains that I had in the resort tower room to the volcano view that I had my first night. The check-in staff was also exceptionally friendly and helpful.    As for the casino itself it is more compact than some of the other casinos so it can seem quite congested and smoky. However the property is in a great location for exploring the Strip.
40,For the most part the hotel was good. Did not have much interaction with the staff and I checked in online and checked out on tv in my room. The view from my room was great.    The only issue I had was that there was not an available refrigerator or microwave in the room.
10,"They messed up my reservation upon providing the confirmation page showing the correct information I was advised by the manager Jasmine that she had no way to tell if the confirmation was ""doctored"". I was forced to pay more than double the amount of what I was quoted."
50,As an introvert I have a hard time when I'm in places with a lot of people/stimulation most of the times but the Mirage has been an amazing experience making me feel welcomed while respecting my space (staff from other Vegas hotels invade your personal space and like to be extremely talkative just because) having extremely clean and tidy rooms serving amazing food and so on. For a place that has a lot going on it definitely works wonders for an introvert.
50,"Clean super friendly perfectly located. The housekeeping staff I would see in the hallway went above and beyond the often mumbled ""hello"" - wishing me a great day/enjoy your day etc. It seems insignificant but it really does make a difference."
20,The Mirage is ok if you're just wanting to come to Las Vegas for the standard casinos. I had not problem with the service or cleanliness of the room. However if you've going to a convention or in town for business you're not going to get the same conveniences you would at other places. The fitness center is open very limited hours - why not open 24 hours like so many other places I've been? There are very limited breakfast options in the hotel that are open before 8 am. Not sure if that is due to staffing issues or what. Other than that you have to walk through the smoky noisy casino to get to the elevator. Probably standard for a Vegas hotel? Not the kind of thing that will get high marks from me.
40,Great visit to the Mirage. The staff were all very friendly & helpful. The location was perfect & I was surprisingly able to enjoy the gambling experience as well. I will definitely return for another visit.
50,I like Uber In/Out - very convenient. Check-out is very easy. Sushi & Grill is what I recommend in terms of good quality and price. I went to many sushi and I feel Sushi& Grill is one of decent restaurants in LV. Room is clean spacious and easy to access.
40,My wife and I went to see Bily Idol at the cosmopolitan Our room at the Mirage was very nice has great Breakfast. This place is very nice with Kick-ass pool and volcano show is very cool. Also the sports book was VERY NICE many large screens to view all games.
50,Stayed here for my Nieces birthday for 4 nights. The hotel and resort were clean. Every ataff member I encountered was super friendly. The pool was amazing and restaurants were convenient food was delicious.
30,Very middle of the road hotel. Good service good grounds but older and needs some small touch ups in the rooms. The casino is nice but also a bit older. The Still restaurant was nice but pricey for what it was.
50,Has just buried my father and just wanted a last min get away before coming hm something just to get my mind off of things and enjoy some family time won't have anymore time off the four of us again until new years eve
30,This is an older casino and the excitement level and the vibe on the casino floor is lacking. Location is great and pool is good although tough to get a pool chair unless you are out there early !  It’s was an ok stay !
30,Some amenities are not correctly installed. Staff is well trained and convenience to the strip is amazing.  Rooms are not adequately soundproof. You can hear people walking and laughing. Really nice restaurants and some nice craps table. Make sure to move away as soon as you make profit and they don’t stay hot for a long time.
50,Great place for conventions and overall hot spot for entertainment. It’s close to local establishments that make you feel you’re a regular person that shouldn’t spend more just to enjoy the simple things in life.
50,Mirage is the best. Free parking easy to get around great atmosphere seen Love at least 10 times The Pantry is the best place to eat. Love the shampoo and conditioner. Did not see a gelato stand which would be great.
30,Room not clean  Stairs to garage not working  Outdated furniture  Sitting chairs disgusting  Contain Don’t block day light  At night the lights shining the building don’t let you enjoy the strip and volcano view  So don’t pay extra for that
50,The Mirage was a beautiful hotel with exceptional service! The bed was I e of the most comfortable I’ve ever slept on. There was a good selection of restaurants inside and there was always a seat at the casino. We will definitely be back!
50,Managed to get a great deal through the M life rewards program as well as comp tickets to several shows. Hotel stay was wonderful. Good food and entertainment and not nearly as sprawling as other hotels (lots of walking in Vegas).
50,Very fun hotel in a great location on the strip. Rooms are clean with super comfortable beds. Staff is very nice and helpful. Casino has a huge selection of games with a great atmosphere and I love the way the resort smells! Watched the Shin Lim show during our stay and we are still talking about how amazing some of the tricks were!
50,We came to Vegas for our 35th Anniversary. We never had a honeymoon so this was our Anniversary/honeymoon all in one. The hotel is beautiful. The staff is full of pleasant people. You know how you will often get crabby unpleasant just not having a good day people? Never met one that worked the Mirage! Room was gorgeous!! On the 25th floor-Tower Resort king. You need something you ask! Great property central to everything. Go see Love by Cirque. Show had to stop midway (technical difficulties) so I hope we get to come back and see the whole show next time!! What we did see was AMAZING!! Loved our stay at the Mirage!!
40,The staff was rude will checking in. And the rooms are really nice besides the bathrooms that were just a standard bathroom like a motel 6 nothing impressive. If I had the opportunity to stay here again I probably would not
50,The mirage was the highlight of my trip didn’t expect so much comfort and easy in and outs literally best hotel in Vegas in my opinion and I would definitely come back again the staff is so friendly and understandable.1000000%
10,A room seemingly out of the 50's. Handicapped room was more like a torture chamber inasmuch as I left in worse shape than when I arrived. Lack of reasonable dining facilities. Room didn't even have a coffee pot microwave or refrigerator for personal use. Pathetic place!
20,When I made the reservation through Orbitz for a roundtrip ticket and a hotel room I was asked if I wanted a room with a view of the strip.  I paid an extra $64 for this but I got a room facing the back of the property and the swimming pool.
30,Good location no refrigerator or coffee in room. They want$35 a day to rent a one because the one in the room contains over priced snacks. $5 for a tea in the morning? What's the resort fee for? Payed $15 a day to park the car in their garage. They don't value their clientele. Treasure island next door advertises free parking and a refrigerator in your room. Might want to check. them out
20,On my first day I presented my Mlife card I asked for an upgrade room. Instead I was provided a room with a large white floodlight coming in through the windows. I switched rooms and this time the neighbours were up all night partying. Lastly when I asked to extend my stay at the Mirage by 1 day I spent more than 6hrs waiting on Mlife phone line talking to Mlife desk and front desk. In the end I moved over to another MGM property Luxor. I didn't have any issues there.
40,Another great trip to Vegas and the Mirage. You can't beat the location and the Pool is excellent for adults. Very relaxed atmosphere and very clean. Rooms are above average and are east to get to and from. Nice to see everything back open
50,Staff are extremely helpful throughout the hotel and truly treat you well. I felt special and respected during my entire stay and I will return to the Mirage and recommend the Hotel and Casino to all. The only improvement would be maybe to have a location with live entertainmment
50,The hotel Was exceptional great casino great stuff great food a great ambience can’t wait to come back. The location is perfect the pool area was amazing. We had a great time overall our stay was great
50,We had a fantastic stay at the Mirage in Las Vegas. We were surprised with a complimentary upgrade to a beautiful suite. This made our experience so much more special. Everyone was helpful and friendly and professional. My husband and I both had a wonderful relaxing massage at the spa. We went to 2 of the restaurants in the hotel both offered great food and exceptional service. The pool atmosphere was exceptional and so relaxing. We came to Las Vegas to see the Rod Stewart concert and randomly picked a hotel near the venue. The Mirage exceeded our expectation and we wish we could of stayed longer. It might of been our first time to Las Vegas but it probably won't be our last time the The Mirage.    spa at the Mirage. The restaurants were great with exceptional service.
50,I enjoyed my stay with my friends. We had dinner at Stack restaurant which was very good also saw Shin Lim limitless show awesome. Everyone was polite and helpful your hotel is beautiful and very clean and l would stay there again. Thank you
50,We enjoyed the Mirage in all aspects including the staff and service to the casino the food we did enjoy Costa a few times. We had a great experience with Brian securing tickets to Shin Lin. If there is a weak point my wife and I enjoy coffee in the room and if was disappointing to have to take the elevator down wait on line just to have a morning coffee. Please offer as an option coffee machines in the room.
50,Room was spacious and clean. I can do without the snacks and drinks or liquor that you have to pay extra for (no price list either). I'd much rather have a coffee center and a usable refrigerator in the room.
50,First time here and I was so impressed! So many games to chose from as well at restaurants. Really enjoyed seeing the dolphins & tigers . The pool area is beautiful and drinks are so good! I recommend this place to everyone can’t wait until we come back. The only negative is our room didn’t get too cold even though we had it at 65.
30,Our first assigned room smelled like marijuana that was over sprayed with air freshener our second room's bathtub wouldn't drain and my husband had to fish out gobs of hair from previous guests!! Multi issues with our room key I had to go to the front desk 3 times. I was offered apologies and a $50.00 food and beverage credit. Not happy about the strip smelling like skunk stink pot. We will not be staying at the Mirage again or even go to Vegas. It has changed so much and everything there is so expensive. Even if you go into the center of town its still crazy expensive. At our last day we ate inside the Mirage for convenience and we were shocked at the $65.00 bill!! For just breakfast?? We will plan a vacation somewhere else next time.
50,Very clean and quiet room  Great service and friendly associates  Good food and quick service  Pool was nice  Spa was really great- made my trip  Sports book was nice and easy to navigate  Check in was great- never had to go to desk  Nice casino
50,The Mirage Hotel & Casino is a great place to stay when Vacationing Las Vegas. Location is perfect in the middle of the Strip. Casino is clean and the entire staff are very friendly and helpful. Had a wonderful time on a 4 night Stay.  Would definitely stay there again and highly recommend it.
50,Our anniversary trip watched the Astros at the still ate dinner at Diablos . The room was clean and Texas sized. This resort actually makes you not want to walk out on the strip. Plenty of entertainment.
10,Encountered two unfortunate frustrations with our stay this week. First the attitudes of staff are uncaring and almost cold. Where there are plenty of simple opportunities to provide basic customer service the employees here don't appear motivated to do so. Second frustration is that the M Life Rewards program just doesn't seem to matter anymore. If you're going to gamble enough to be tracked or earn enough points to advance to a high tier you kind of want it to matter. No one here gives a crap. Perhaps a casualty of the pandemic but wasn't it just a few months ago when these companies (and employees) were so desperate for visitors to return? Well now that gamblers are back don't expect anyone here to give a squat about you or even crack a smile. I ended up spending the majority of time across the street at the Caesars properties where people were genuinely friendly. Not sure what they're doing differently but it was a pretty dramatic difference.
50,Our room was clean and well stocked with everything but a coffee maker. I like a cup the minute I get up so that was the only bummer. You can get room service to bring it to you. The casino was nice clean not smokie even though busy. The show offerings were great. We did the Beatles and had the best seats in the house.
50,Mirage was a great place to stay. We have stayed here numerous times without any major issues. Staff is very polite and courteous. They are willing to go above and beyond to assist you with anything. We love staying here.
50,Another great stay at the mirage. Pool is top notch. Hotel is always clean and safe. fantastic location. With the Buffett closed not a lot of options in the morning for breakfast. The pantry restaurant was very busy usually a wait but worth it. You can get on wait list via your phone.
30,Not what I expected. Internet was horrible whole trip. Rooms were ok. Upon check in the amount due was completely different from what was emailed to me to confirm everything. Check out too way too long and was left at front desk.
50,Excellent vacation overall. Highly recommend this as a place to see. With the wait. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel was located in the heart of the strip within easy walking distance to a lot of other places.
20,The property itself was just fine. Nothing super special about it but also nothing terrible. It’s a basic Las Vegas hotel with some character. The atrium is super pretty! The reason for my low rating is due to the rowdy clientele at this hotel. Due to its affordability I think it attracts a lot of disrespectful customers. Each night I was there I was woken up around 2 am by loud yelling people in the hallways. My last night even had some domestic violence type stuff happening down the hall where the entire building was shaking due to someone throwing furniture around. I couldn’t go back to sleep after that and am still trying to recover from these less than sleep filled nights.
50,Went on an adventure to defeat gamblor the terrible my band of brothers fought well and some might have fallen to his temptation of success but I came out victorious and defeated my foe ready to come back for another quest
50,The Mirage is in a great location on the strip very clean hotel with adequate security. We have been there two times and will go back to the same hotel again thank you for your great service. Look forward to going again soon!
50,Excellent location for being on the Las Vega Strip. Easy access to and from the Hotel. Service staff is always courteous and friendly. Great place to stay. Great choice of restaurants spa services are very good as well.
30,The valet employees are nice but they damaged my car for a second time. A man tried breaking into our room and it took 30 minutes for security to arrive. At the time 2 women were in the room and this is totally unacceptable. At the end of this survey trip advisor asked for information I don't have and I bet they don't publish it.
10,I had to change rooms multiple times because they were so filthy dirty. Months of dust collected on the phone. Months of dust and other stains on the lamp on the nightstand… I don’t know how stains get on the lamp! Hair and grime around the shower drain. Light switch is visibly dirty. I cleaned the room with my own Clorox wipes and the wipes were black after I wiped down the desk and countertops. I checked out early and changed hotels. Don’t stay here.
50,I went to Rod concert and stay in mirage for 2 night first night i book The Beatles Love show..very happy.  The resort was nice check in and check out very easy just use the app on my phone.. all staff are very nice..love to go back to stay soon.
30,Hotel was a great value a bit older had an issue with the pool closing early and was hard to get a drink on the casino floor felt severely understaffed. I felt like given the pool issue they could have done more to make it right. I was very dissapointed with that part of our trip.
50,I will come back here not just for the property and its amenities but for the great service I received from every single team member I came in contact with. Especially the hotel staff. My experience was nothing short of amazing. Thank you Mirage.
20,I was provided 2 medical refrigerators 1 on Sun and another on Monday; neither were operational causing issues with my meds. Switched to adjoining rooms first rooms good second room not vacuumed. Caramel popcorn all along the floor and window seal. Manager tried to be helpful and it was appreciated.
50,Haven’t been here since Siegfried and Roy had the tiger show. Still great center strip location great resort with many excellent restaurants. Not quite as much constant club level beat/music as many other nearby hotels. Don’t miss the LOVE show.
50,Clean room. Great restaurant choices. Spa experience was wonderful. Gym was clean and had good equipment choices. Enjoyed the shopping. Felt safe with staff fully masked. Room was clean and masks and sanitizer available in the room & throughout the casino. Restaurant choices were good.
50,Like the property very much. I’m giving it 5 stars because we had a great trip. Only thing I didn’t like was the size of the bathroom. But that is the only negative and it’s not a big deal to me! Came home with my money so that made up for bathroom size
50,The mirage is a great centrally located hotel/resort. The only fault was our inability to utilize the refrigerator during our stay. There should be a “I don’t want alcohol stocked in my room for this visit” option when booking. Then guests can keep water soda or food snacks chilled during their stay!
40,Very nice hotel; wish I could have stayed longer. My only complaint was dirty windows in the room itself. The front desk was exceptional and checking in and checking out were both a breeze. I wish Rhumbar was still around but I guess that closed in August.
10,The place was very underwhelming the room was mediocre the bathroom outdated and seriously gross. Save your money and stay else where. I've stayed in motel 6 more luxurious than this. The name Mirage means nothing don't be fooled.
30,We have been taking an annual trip to Vegas for 15 years and 14 of those stays have been at the Mirage.    The resort is very nice but the rooms need some TLC. Specifically in our room: a leak in the bathroom ceiling dripped constantly leaving a little puddle between the toilet and tub the tub drained so slow you end up spalshing around in a couple inches of water by the time you finished your shower - and if you were the second person to shower you started off with the last person's water. Grout needs real attentuon - large gaps in tikes looks bad and cannot be easy to clean making it likely that it is growing mold and mildew.    And they now have pet friendlt rooms which seems fine but they should not allow pets in restaurants sitting on the seats and being fed from the table. Staff came by looked at this exact scenario considered it and the never said anything. This is not a service animal.
50,Didn't stay at hotel but played in casino and saw Shim Lin (sp) show casino lots of fun great service good selection slot machines show was excellent highly recommend drinks at the center bar Bartender Omar awesome made the best drinks will return
30,The location was good room had lots of wear and tear bedding was tattered and the tub was rusty celling fan barley worked even the living areas mirrors got fogged up the pool area was nice water was some what dirty
50,Overall everything was nice. Location was great on the strip check-in and out was a breeze housekeeping kept the rooms clean but really wished they supplied refrigerators and microwaves in rooms. With the cost of the stay plus the resort fees you have to pay for the should supply these in the rooms.
20,No out let to charge phone by one side of the bed. The rooms are getting outdated and the price keeps going up. This is not like the old Mirage that people are used to if you ever thought of looking around I think now is the time. We are loyal long time Mirage guests and we are going to start looking around.
50,Everything you could possibly look for in a resort all jam-packed into one facility: amazing and attentive staff vast amount of great restaurants and shops on offer proximity to all of Vegas's world-renowned tourist locations not a single room with a bad view fantastic room service and quick and easy check-in and check-out.    The only downside was having to leave.    Hope to visit again soon!
50,This trip was our 4-5th at this hotel and as always we were looked after very well... the staff go above and beyond the food is great and there are several options... great little bar in the centre of casino and usually a music performer to watch in the evening... I suggest visiting the mirage as it's a great place and location on the strip.
50,This is my first time in Las Vegas that I stay at the Mirage Hotel & Casino.All staff all very professional and exceptional. Lobby all very clean and easy to check in and out. Easy fast to check in and out line are very short
10,We are at the Mirage right now. I can only tell you DO NOT go.  We pay a hefty Resort Fee but service is non existent. You call the front desk and have to hold the line for 30 minutes and as an excuse you get the answer they are short staffed. The internet is not working either and the AC in the room is pretty much non existent. Far from paradise. Go somewhere else.
40,Front desk staff both friendly and professional on two occasions. The room was nicely appointed cleaned thoroughly each day and quiet in the evenings and during the night. Great selection of table games and slots. Would stay there again.
40,"Rooms are nice bedding is good - price point was a bit high.  Hallway was under repair windows could be cleaner room was ok clean but not freshest possible.  Restaurants work with a QR code reservation and wait list (pretty much everywhere as everything belongs to MGM these days) - so get ready to be in a queue at all times - and half of them were closed.  $40 (+tax) resort fee is stiff since when you go to the pool (which is nice) you have to pay extra for ""premium seating"" areas. Pool bars (2) have expensive slushies or basic beer but nothing fancy. Feels a bit like resort for the masses without making much of an effort to stand out."
10,I feel like we were scammed by the front desk clerk because he charged us an upgrade fee for a room very similar that one we’ve stayed in before.  The rooms need a thorough cleaning; the carpet is filthy and smells. The shower heads need to be replaced. And new or cleaner towels would be nice.
50,The mirage hotel was great. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was nice and clean. The beds were very comfortable. My granddaughter really liked the dolphins and tigers. We will definitely be back.
50,The Mirage is the Best! Great atmosphere great customer service and great rooms! For a fair price I got a great Vegas experience and the room service food was surprisingly delicious! Don't miss out on this Vegas gem.
40,Mirage is a wonderful hotel very centrally located and accommodations reasonable. The rooms need updating and they need more restaurants on the property. I was given $50.00 in food credit but was difficult to use since all their restaurants were overcrowded with 50 minute waits. But since It's central there are many other restaurants near by.
40,Clean property & friendly staff.. Sportsbook was understaffed & rooms outdated. Very nice property but after 30 years it’s time to update the rooms.I’m sure this is known complaint. Overall good experience.
10,There is nothing special about the hotel in Las Vegas but what really ticked me off was their really bad service regarding arriving parcels! We ordered certain medicines and miscellaneous items from Amazon to the hotel and they amounted to no more than 200 US dollars. They were delivered in three different deliveries in five different packages. The hotel charged us 10 US dollars per package! This had never happened to us before (our previous trip was a couple of months ago to Texas). We have been privileged to visit the US on various occasions (East Coast West Coast Southern states other hotels in Las Vegas) and never had this service been so disorganized and/or charged for!
50,Even though is not a new Hotel in the Strip... it has a lot to offer! Great service restaurants and wonderful location. My dad and I had the challenge to eat at the exquisite Heritage Steak for a good steak dinner. Binions Cafe was a go to every morning for a nice breakfast.
10,I had the 2 bedroom penthouse. It was suppose to be available for check in at 3pm and it wasn’t until 10pm after I sat there and waited. Then the front desk lady tried to cancel the reservation and put me in a lesser room which I did not want so then that messed up my original reservation. Once they finally got me in my room only one of the tubs worked. There was handles missing from doors and drawers. Then on day 2 all keys stopped working and I was notified that my reservation was cancelled again so I had to go back and argue with the front desk because that said I cancelled my reservation and I said no I did not your manager cancelled it without my permission because she didn’t have my room ready. Finally they got it right. Don’t waste your time with this place it’s a mess
30,We stayed with a wedding party. Had a great time. But the amenities are about average. We aren't smokers so that aspect of smoking allowed in most public spaces was difficult. Poolside near indoor open air restaurants gambling area etc.
10,I accidentally left my grandmother's vintage leather blazer in the hotel room after I checked out. I called once I realized it and the hotel was unable to locate it so they either employ thieves OR they don't clean properly if the next guest was able to take my coat out of the closet. 0/10 would NOT recommend.
40,We got a one bedroom tower suite for three nights and we were very happy with the room. It was large enough to host friends and didnt break the bank too much. The furniture was a bit old and looked worn down. The TV no longer went into its storage. The couch had some marks of wear and tear but overall we were not dissapointed. The halls were mostly kept and the casino floor looked just as it did on NL's Vegas Vacation! I guess that's good and bad. The one down side was checking in. We kept trying to do everything online but kept giving us the wrong room. The lines were always long and all of our friends encountered a similar situation. I would expect to wait an hour to get your room. That being said those working the desks were very helpful and polite. We would definitely stay here again.
50,The Mirage was a great place to stay. Perfect location and well maintained. There are plenty of table games and slots to choose from. There are also many food options to choose from. I would recommend the Mirage it visiting Las Vegas.
40,Very kind and courteous staff. Room was comfortable. Slightly dated but very Clean. We got a suite at Mirage very clean and comfortable bed. Staff was really kind also. Not that fake smile now slide me a tip. Really impressed by all the staff.
20,Just stayed for the last 4 days. I was extremely surprised how hard it is to see out of the windows on the top 5 floors. Paying extra for a view is a complete waste. Stay below the 26th floor if you want to be able to see any kind of view.
40,I want to preface this review by saying that I was really excited to stay in a Stay Well room… I have pretty bad allergies so it made perfect sense to stay where we had an in-room air purifier. We also heard that these particular rooms have memory foam beds which is great since that’s what we have at home… Those beds were incredibly hard. The pillows were amazing but there was literally nothing that could be done to save the bed. Please take this into consideration when booking! Other than that- Beautiful property with amazing staff!!
40,Best pool in Las Vegas. Good assortment of games. Excellent choices of eating establishments. An excellent place to relax. The room musty so bring a can of air freshener with you. Very clean inside and out.
50,I stayed at the Mirage this last weekend. OMG! The facilities the room the restaurants the extra-curricular activities-everything was fantastic! The location of the hotel was nice and I really liked that it is situated a bit off the road so you truly feel as though you are tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip. We ate at a couple of restaurants on property and the food was excellent and reasonably priced (for Vegas). We also got a Cabana at the pool one day. We had an ABSOLUTE BLAST!!! Totally worth the money! Our host Ariel was absolutely wonderful and totally made the experience. The staff really appeared to care about you and your needs and was happy to help wherever they could. I would highly recommend staying at the Mirage and I will definitely be staying there again!
40,Overall we like staying at the Mirage. Love the smell when you walk in the door. Need better comps to be competitive with other casino/hotels though. And friendlier workers at the MLife desk. It seemed like they were scolding us for asking questions.
40,Very comfortable stay. We were happy to come back to this hotel every night because of the vibe. It didn't seem too crowded obnoxious or overwhelming compared to others we walked through. I won a few hundred bucks in the casino which was nice too. The rooms are nice and clean and had 2 sinks and a lot of counter space.
20,I have stayed at the mirage before but was disappointed this time around. Shower wouldn’t drain not fixed after calling. Sink constantly “gurgled.” Ants in the bathroom. I checked in online and this might have been a bad idea since I got stuck on the second floor with a view of the roof AC units. Just more run down than I remember pre-covid.
40,Had a great view of strip… wanted a room on 24th or 25 th floor but was told no view is strip! Maybe next time. Looking forward to next visit in Vegas. Found out mirage doesn’t have shuttle to and from airport?
50,The Mirage has always been our destination when staying in Las Vegas. We have stayed there for the last 20 years. The suites are very spacious and we love the choice of restaurants all of which have great food.
10,We had a package sent to the hotel for our Conference Exhibitor Booth. The Tracking shows it was DELIVERED and Signed for by  A. Janette (Employee of Hotel) at 11:54m on 10/7/21. We have screenshots and proof! But the Hotel LOSt our package. They cant find it and are NOW blaming FedEx and saying that the FedEx Driver LIED NEVER handed it off to the Hotel Employee. But Rather LIED and FORGED the Employee's signature and left the package somewhere random and no one can find it? Bottom line is that I lost almost $2000 in this ordeal between graphic design salary for my employees printing costs on the brochures. Not to mention that these brochures where suppose to be put into the conference bags to the 800+ Attendees as a special invite to a brand new technology... THAT DID NOT HAPPEN! The Hotel didn't even try to make it right. They did NOT reimburse me for ANYTHING? They wouldn't even give me a free extended check out. I am shocked at how they tried to blame everyone else and not take responsibility for their actions or try to make things right.
10,If this app would allow me to rate zero I would. I’ve always loved Las Vegas and especially the Mirage as it’s a staple in the city. The staff made a  Mistake on the reservation dates so when we showed up we didn’t have a room. We got in at midnight and we’re exhausted. They managed to find a room for us to share the first night and charged us triple. We needed 2 rooms for a total of 13 nights for a business function. They wouldn’t honor pricing and it cost nearly 6k! Rooms are outdated and gross. Will never stay here again.
50,We used all the amenities Mirage had to offer room service concierge restaurants shows casino shops pool & dolphin habitat. Everything & every staff we countered were amazing! I would recommend the mirage to anyone going to Vegas.
40,Overall good stay. The rooms were clean and staff was friendly. Mirage is placed on the strip easily get to a lot by walking. Enjoyed our stay a lot will most likely keep booking our trips to Vegas at mirage.
50,Came to Vegas for a bit of R&R from Texas. While here we went a concert - ZZ Top - the Little Ol' Band from Texas. Which was great by the way. Our stay at The Mirage was wonderful the casino restaurants and pools were perfect. Pool side service was spot on! Cashiers and staff members at M Life rewards were busy but took the time to give you one to one service. In fact every staff member we came across was always over the top helpful and friendly. Rooms were clean and all safety precautions were upheld to the fullest.
50,The Mirage is a wonderful venue for a conference. As a member of Transportation Communication Union I spent 6 days in this lovely hotel. From the bell hop and front desk clerk to the bar staff and cleaning staff every employee I encountered was professional and friendly. Thank you for making a week away from home more comfortable.
40,big casino clean did not like how far it was to guest elevators. rooms clean however water pressure and location of showerheads were poor. food and drink prices are way too high at your retail snack shops.
50,The Mirage was definitely a wonderful place to stay. Considering it’s age it was clean and well in tact. Staff was helpful and friendly. There was a lot offered within the hotel but it was also close to lots of other attractions casinos restaurants etc making it easy to get around without always having to catch a ride!
50,Very nice casino and hotel with friendly staff and comfortable beds in the room. Love the dolphin show as well as walking through the gardens to see the lions and wild animals. I would stay there again and take my grandkids to see the animals.
50,Mirage was a wonderful property to stay at. Check in was easy and quick. If you do not want to interact with a human there are kiosks to use. Basic king room is great for a trip to vegas. The bathroom is small. The tower king has a larger bathroom. Pool at mirage is a true oasis. We loved the vibe at Mirage.
40,This was a decent place to stay. The staff was friendly. The location was good. The price was right. I get up early and like to have coffee right away and that required a walk because there is no coffee maker in the room nor a coffee shop that opens up early enough for my taste.
50,The Mirage is an excellent location and has plenty to do for a while trip. Also it was surprisingly clean while featuring a friendly staff. I usually hop around the strip but we always found more fun to do without leaving the property. Also my wife loved loved pool.
50,"We stayed in one of the Mirage's ""Stay Well"" rooms. Would highly recommend! The room was very tranquil and had extra amenities such as air purifier dehumidifier fragrances and relaxing lighting. Great value for those looking to relax after a long day"
50,We were unsure whether we should travel from Canada to Las Vegas due to the COVID and reading other comments about bad service and times. We decided to go and stayed at the Mirage hotel where we have stayed the past 15 years and we were actually surprised how good the service was. Staff were all extremely kind and helpful. Our room was cleaned daily to our satisfaction. We felt safe in the Mirage as we seen security and staff making sure the guests were safe. Lots of masks and sanitizer available. Very happy overall with our stay and we cant wait to go back.
10,I had gone with a room preset and was put into a handicapped room that had a broken dresser. Not the best experience I’ve had in Vegas. I was very disappointed in my stay i probably will not come back
20,During our reservations we were told through MLife that there was a $50 a day offer for food and beverage credit. When we arrived they told us the offer was valid later during the stay (when we saw charges billed) we checked again on the offer and the front desk no longer honored the credit.
30,Las Vegas of old is dead. Homeless digging through trash cans exorbitant prices resort fees parking fees ect. What a joke. Room needed updating but was clean. Interior of hotel is nice but you could spend your money elsewhere and get much better value.
40,Our room was clean and spacious however $5 for a bottle of Coke was a bit excessive. And $16 for 5 skinny overdone dry chicken fingers at Snacks was way overpriced . Our room was at the end of a very long hallway and that was quite a hike if you forgot something in the room. At check in they should advise you where the room is located. Also we had some noisy people screaming and slamming doors in the hallway at 3 am. Hindsight tells me to ask where the room is located the next time and it would be nice if they had a resort map in the lobby of or on their website.
50,Was there for a conference and everything was beautiful neat clean and organized. The staff was excellent and friendly. The room was very comfortable including bed and pillows. Good food and great Cirque show as well.
50,We have been staying at the mirage since 2011. Obviously we missed last year but could not wait until our return visit! The Mirage did not disappoint! Service is still outstanding in every department! Our host Willie Haddock always treats us like VIPs and the comps were great. All departments are highly rated. There are some differences since covid...the restaurants are not all open at the same time. My favorite Stack was not open while we were there which was disappointing. Cravings was not open at all a breakfast fave for us. So getting reservations due to lack of selections was harder. But for the most part everyone made the best of it and we came home completely satisfied from our trip. Already planning the next one ;)
10,"I arrived for the Digital Dealer Expo. My company covered Monday night - Wednesday night (10/11-10/13). I added an extra night at my own expense for 10/14 and mentioned at check-in the reservations were back-to-back so I could stay in the same room. At 2am Tuesday morning someone frantically swiped a key card on my door dozens of times while aggressively yanking/pulling the door handle. I figured this was a drunk guest who went to the wrong room. This stopped after about a minute. 30 seconds later the person came back and became more forceful banging on the door swiping the card and pulling the door handle. I grabbed a lamp and was going to smash the guy if he came in. I yelled ""WRONG ROOM"" and the intrusion stopped.  20 minutes later (2:20am) the check-in desk called my room and asked who I was and if was I Mr. Berk Berkshire Berkins... something with a ""B"". I told him no and identified myself. The check-in desk told me someone had cancelled my reservation. I told him no I was checked-in paid a $300 deposit on my credit card and was issued two room keys. I then asked if this was the cause of the weirdo banging on my door... that the Mirage issued keys to my room to someone else. I was told yes and the clerk offered to comp my resort fees.  I thought that was the end of it. Then on Wednesday I received an email from the Mirage asking me to go online and check-in for my stay. I then when back to the check-in desk told the person there the entire story of what happened at 2am Tuesday and now I'm wondering if the back-to-back reservation is actually set up. Why would I have to check-in? I'm already in the room!  The employee went into a back office for 5-10 minutes. When he came back he said my back-to-back reservation was ok. I did not need to check-in again and that the resort fees were comped. I would have thought with all the issues my room would have been comped. Between someone giving keys to my room to some weirdo him trying to get in (twice) at 2am being told my reservations were cancelled and then being told I had to check-in (again) after already being there this was the worst hotel experience I’ve had in Las Vegas."
50,We had a wonderful time. The hotel was great lots to do and wonderful places to eat with excellent food. Staff was very friendly and super helpful. Would stay again and would definitely recommend to friends
40,My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Mirage. Sadly the pools and hot tub closed each evening at 6:00. We were impressed with the amazing service from everyone especially in the Otoro Robata Grill & Sushi Restaurant!
20,USB don’t work Lamp at beside did not work lighted mirror in bathroom did not work and a big gap under our door so we heard everyone in the hall. The extra fee for using emeties is crazy when we did not use them
40,My stay was good it was for business. My bathroom smelled like mold and that was very concerning. The tub is old and needs a touch up. The staff was great the casino attendent that brings drinks was not very good. She told me she would be right back and never came back I left to go to another section that attendant was leaving and then the girl who told me she would be right back showed up over there.
40,The staff were are very friendly and some were exceptional. I had a great stay from the moment we checked in. Our front desk clerk was fabulous! The room was a little on the small side and the bathroom was tiny. Otherwise happy at the Mirage.
10,There was black mold in the shower in our room. I developed a chronic cough which was so bad when I was in the room that it prevented me from sleeping through the night. When we brought this to the front desk agents attention we were told that the resort fees would be refunded and that was the end of it. In our mind this is the bare minimum of what should have been done due to the health risk at hand.
50,Was there for convention. Was able to get work done and still have fun with friends and family. Entire staff was great. Restaurants and bars were fantastic. Everything was affordable. The dolphins are a plus!!
20,We were only there for 36 hours and encountered several problems. Nobody seemed to be able to resolve us when we did have problems and nobody seemed interested in how we felt. I have stayed there many times and loved it but wont' go back.
50,Second time staying at the Mirage; we really love the location and while it's not a super luxurious place or anything like that there's also absolutely nothing wrong with it - and in Vegas we're not spending tons of time in the hotel anyway! I have literally nothing bad to say about the place.    Bed was comfy view (we did Strip View) was fantastic and we could even see the dolphins jumping around in the morning :)    Casino was solid including the automated sports betting machines. Overall just a solid place.    Was VERY impressed with the widespread masking and availability of free masks all over the place.
50,The room was clean and quiet. The staff was very friendly and did an excellent job of trying to enforce the unpopular mask rules that are now in effect out there. Although the front desk area seemed to be a little short staffed they did an excellent job of checking people in and were very friendly about doing it. When I'm in Las Vegas I usually stay at the Aria or the Encore but based on this experience I will always have my sights set on the Mirage. Also my casino host went above and beyond!
50,The Mirage is the perfect hotel for business or pleasure! The hotel has everything you need and is in the perfect location to walk the strip and visit other hotels and shops. The only draw back was the restaurants were not open all the time and if you dont book dinner reservations in advance.. there are no other options to eat at the hotel.
30,vey bad casino no win slot and tables is terrible dont win ever in any time im lost huge money in the tables the dealer win every time dont bust  dont liked this casino is a fake  i very sad never play again there
40,Since this resort had been around for so long I had the impression that it wouldn’t be nice. I was pleasantly surprised.  The resort overall was clean the staff very nice the bed comfy the room updated and clean. The only minor thing I came across was some mold in the tile shower grout. It wasn’t horrible so not too big of a deal. I will also say the overall smell of the resort was pleasant. I am not a smoker and the resort has done a good job with this. This could also be because of vaping popularity but either way I could walk through the casino without feeling that I could not breathe.
50,Room was excellent . Very friendly Restaurant very nice and food good? Service.front desk very polite very efficient Bellemans very friendly Blackjack table very polite everybody was enjoying himself being friendly to the guest
50,The Mirage was one of the cleanest resorts I've visited. Check in process was so easy and my room was ready by 11am when I arrived in Las Vegas. Staff was polite and fun while doing there jobs and seemed quite accommodating to guests. You can't beat the location of this resort. My party and I were able to experience so much within walking distance.
50,Everyone was so helpful n polite. My daughter n I had the best stay at the Mirage. Food was very good n never a long wait. Room service was prompt n packaged perfectly. Checking in n out was fast n easy too. Can’t wait to stay again!
40,Our room was very nice. The volcano display out front each night was fantastic. The restaurants are good but it is hard to get a table and sometimes they are closed during meal times for some reason. I would have liked a coffee maker in the room. The toilet paper and tissues were very cheap and rough.
10,You will get better service in prison . The staff is very rude and unhelpful. Hotel and casino were at least cleaner than the nasty pool. I would rather of stayed at motel 8. Save your money and go to Aria.
20,Changed my room to a 2 queen room even though my reservations said resort king and I paid for a resort king. Staff was unwilling to help and fix the issue. The location on the strip was good and that is the only reason for the 2 stars.
20,The tub in the room wouldn’t drain. The exhaust fan sounded like a jet airplane. The pit boss at the blackjack table was super rude.Two different machines broke while playing them. The rooms need a major update done to them.
50,It was a trip for my birthday and Me and my girlfriend did enjoy ourselves We enjoy the hotel to the highest everything was excellent And We will be backHopefully next year to do it all over again or as soon as possible
50,This trip was for our honeymoon. We were treated great and our room was beautiful even though the view wasn’t as great as I expected. Love that the casino was so big and the pool and amazing. Will definitely return in the future.
40,Very nice accomodations. Breakfast was very good and fast.  Would have liked more Pai Gao tables in the Casino.  Check in ahead was spectacular!  Very friendly people.  Came around casino with drinks on a timely basis.
40,Quiet and clean room. Maid service was very good considering the lack of good staff that is available. My only complaint is you need a larger place to eat breakfast and more help at Starbucks. Will be back again for my next meeting in Vegas
40,The room was good spacious but for the amount of money I paid for the hotel the bathroom was way to small. The Tube bearly fits two people and you can't even move the shower head. You open the door and the toilet is right in front and you have to close it inorder to use the shower overall disappointed.
50,We had a great stay at The Mirage. The service was great at the hotel and I think a lot of the staff had worked there a long time because they were some of the most helpful staff I've ever encountered. The rooms were a little dated and you can hear what's going on outside your room sometimes. They were installing TVs on our floor and they started early which was a little unfortunate but how can you fix a dated room if you never do the updates?! So I totally understood. Awesome facilities great value I'd definitely recommend the Mirage.
50,I've found there are two types of properties on the strip: Those that are resting on decades-old laurels and those that consistently work to improve. The Mirage is the latter: Clean modern walkable and in the heart of it all. Great stay!
50,Rooms clean and food was affordable. Check in was very quick and enjoyed the no contact check in.  If you need a affordable casino to say at I would say the Mirage is the best choice. Also the location of being in the middle of the strip makes a big difference.
50,We enjoyed our stay and we hope to return in the near future. All the staff we met were very friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and comfortable to stay in. The casino was well organized and sanitize. Even tho there were a lot of people around we were able to feel safe by wearing our mask and maintaining the distance whenever possible.
40,Everything was clean and the setting was beautiful. We were disappointed that the restaurants were not all open but we realized Las Vegas is like the rest of America with a shortage of workers so business has to adapt. The room was not cleaned during our stay and we assumed Covid was to be blamed for that. The view from our room overlooked the strip and was beautiful at night.
50,Love this property go every year and it never disappoints. Rooms are super clean staff is extremely helpful and friendly all of the restaurants at the mirage are awesome. Love breakfast by the pool every morning. 5 STARS
40,"I very much enjoyed my 1st visit to Las Vegas. My experience at the Mirage was wonderful. I stayed on the ""Stay Well"" floor and enjoyed the room. The resort was spotless.  I chose the Mirage because my reason for coming to Las Vegas was the Cirque show and discovered a delightful resort"
50,The Mirage has a great location. The hotel is right on the center of the strip. Plenty of restaurants to dine in all delicious. The gaming has a great variety of slot games. The interior has a comfy feel. The pool area was amazing huge with waterfalls and a couple of big jacuzzis. Love this hotel. BTW for coffee lovers  there’s a couple of Starbucks in the hotel.
20,WARING: this Informattion is not on the website! We got to the hotel and checked in. Only to find that the hotel added a long list of additional fees that was not on the website! The extra frees include: using amenities extra fee to use the pool using refrigerator (you couldn't put anything in or take out) no microwave/coffee maker deposit and parking fee. After we got over that shock we went to our room. Only to find a dirty bathroom! We called and asjed to get it clean and they didn't.  Definitely not staying here next time! CALL THEM WITH QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU BOOK WITH THEM!!!!
50,Keep the excellent security to ensure everyone is wearing masks. I felt safe. Excellent restaurants and snacks. We enjoyed the Love Beatles Cirque du Soleil. The Mirage is also centrally located on the strip.
50,Loved this Hotel and Casino  Price for our was room very reasonable  Nice size room  good view of strip . Very clean room and Bed was so comfortable . And the smell in the room was so Delightful. We had the Stay Well Room . All the Staff were so Friendly and Courteous GREAT TIME :) Will Definitely stay there next I visit Vegas .
50,The Mirage is what I would consider a mid level Las Vegas strip property. Just the right amount of luxury and activity that makes this place a comfortable stay. The big plus is location. Right in the center of the strip.
50,My niece got Married actually i walk her down the Aisle. And Stayed for The Raider home opener. And plus i won 10 grand. At the Mirage. It a very good trip i love the mirage. Everything is clean and kind
50,I love being at The Mirage amenities are great and clean. The staff are good and accommodating and respectful and wonderful to talk to. Like the slot machines that are new and exciting. The restaurants are also affordable and offer good delicious food at fair and reasonable prices. All restaurants at the hotel offer good food with good service.
50,location is centralized  walking distance to go to other casinos rooms are clean and service is good. guests are all very disciplined in wearing masks and social distancing. I would strongly recommend this hotel/casino to friends
50,I will stay here every time I come to Vegas. Great pool. Easy to navigate. Great location ( center strip) . Smells great. They pump in tropical smells. It really helps with the cigarette smells you get with the rest of the resorts. I’ll always stay here.
20,i have stayed ar the mirage several times over the years this was the most dissapointing trip there i ever experianced. room was said to be comped for 2 days but it was still 88 dollars for resort feels and taxes i paid full price for sunday plus resort fees. the room smelled dirty bathtub was dirty with stains curtains didnt match. employees felt they were doing you a favor by being there food was too expensive. over all a very dissapointing trip to my favorite hotel casino
50,From the check in to the check out everything was smooth clean and friendly. Scott Poster was great helped me booked at 12 person reservation in seconds after the restaurant originally said it was too late. All the bars were quick service the tables were great and friendly. 10/10
50,This hotel is always clean and fun. We went with couples but there were a lot of families there also. Options for food is good but the price is high. We love the pool area and loved that it had a spa and shopping in the hotel.
40,Plan on eating off the property reservations needed or closed. Very long wait time to squeeze you in (3hours). It's a great location plenty of options to eat off the property be prepared to walk. No coffee pot or microwave.
30,The rooms did not have coffee makers or refrigerators so if you want to keep some items cold bring a cooler or pay for a refrigerator to be brought into room. Bathroom tub clogged. Overall was not impressed with the hotel and rooms for the price.
20,We were put into the wrong room. Paid for a king tower was put into a double tower. Front desk claimed the booked all king tower rooms and above. Put us in a regular king did nothing to make up for it
40,Would stay at this Mlife property again The location is very fun and the hotel staff and property is very comfortable. Selection of slots is ample and the table game staff is well above average. A little short staffed more open tables would have lead to additional gaming. Understandable with COVID. Great Job for those who showed up!!!
50,Just got back from a stay at the mirage their pool area is amazing. We had a tower king room that was nice and roomy. Pantry room delivery is quick and delicious. Heritage steak house is amazing! California Pizza Kitchen never disappoints. Even had some luck on the slots
10,I've lost count of the amount of times that I have been to this property & honestly expected better. The rooms havent been updated I still have to slide the bedding to the side to plug in my fan. TI was much better. No plans to fix that tram after years
10,This is an average hotel so if want a experience stay somewhere else. The bathroom don’t even have shower gel only soap. It took to long to check in and you have to carry your ID to charge anything to your room.
10,It's been 16 years since I stayed here and won't ever again. I had to wait for a room even though people ahead of me were all given rooms immediately (I arrived 1 hour before check in time). My room was right next to the elevator. I heard it ding every single time it arrived. I shared a wall with the ice machine which I could hear as if it were in my room (thin walls). Apparently people congregate here just like at water coolers in the office. There were no device chargers/USB ports on the nightstands even though every other hotel has those these days. My shower would drain. I took a 5 minute shower which I cut short because the water was about to overflow all over the bathroom floor. The shower was at 6pm. When I checked out at 9am the next morning it was still completely full of water so I couldn't take another shower. Spend your money elsewhere on the strip.
30,The room itself wasn't the greatest and their was a good chunk on the floor that was wet and then the service itself was terrible and no seemed to know what they were doing at all. Then the guest service wasn't the greatest either as they weren't really helpful if I needed something.
50,It was a perfect get-a-way. We celebrated my sister's 60th birthday & from beginning to end...everything was great. Everyone we dealt with could not have been more helpful. From pick up driver check in individuals restaurant employees...all friendly & couldn't have made our stay more enjoyable. Mirage is one of my favorite casinos in Vegas.
50,The Mirage provided us a great experience. The service was excellent from the time we arrived to the time that we left. Everyone was friendly. Our standard room was spacious. Everything was very clean. The food and drink options were exceptional. Will definitely be back.
50,First time staying here and it was a beautiful resort. My husband and I traveled from NC to celebrate both our anniversary and his birthday. Make sure to check out the Secrete Garden where the big cats and dolphins are housed. Amazing experience!
50,I booked another hotel on the strip trying to “try new things” and I was very dissatisfied. Checked out of there and found a great deal for a last minute room. Helpful staff and very accommodating. Will definitely return!
50,My Favorites Hotel on the Strip  I stay There every Time I am in Las Vegas  Great LocatIon on the Strip  Great Staff  Great Entertainment  Great Restaurants  Very Clean Rooms  Room Service  Great Parking Structure
10,Minimal amenities in bathroom filthy drain caked with debris and hair no outlets near bed poor wi-fi signal precluding any work from taking place. Front desk gave me a tech support number to call (but there’s no pen provided in room—seriously?) tech support was unable to assist with Ei fi even though I offered to pay for higher speed. Of course the 60 resort fee is charged . Really surprised at how low this hotel had sunk.
20,The hotel is nice but the rooms are super disappointing.  From the halls smelling like smoke to our fire alarm that wouldn’t stop randomly going off we just were not impressed.  We had to pay a huge premium because of the fight and raiders game being that weekend and feel so underwhelmed  The mirage used to be a nice place but it’s just meh now.
40,If you are looking to gamble pai gow Mirage would not be my recommendation. The hotel is clean and the staff is friendly. The table area is just very small and less than expected for a casino of this size.
30,I think the Mirage is a good hotel at a good location. But if you’re looking for a hotel to stay at and play Pai Gow poker suggest staying at Park MGM or Harrahs. Staff is friendly but does not seem to be properly surveyed by management for customer feedback.
50,Stayed here for 2 nights at the end of our trip out west. First time in Vegas with kids went well. The facilities were great especially the pool. Great location. Very clean. Good choices for dining and the food was excellent.
40,All good except bar service by the pool. The waitress was nice just overwhelmed. The room was clean and staff were kind. I wish the casino was not that cold coming from really hot to freezing. Overall a fun time with friends..
10,Trying to be as patient as possible during these times but this property has seen better days.    1. Checked into a room with a person sleeping in his bed.  2. New room had random hairs and cleaning materials left in the bathroom.  3. Looks like the ceiling is going to fall at any point.    Bring back the good ol’ days.
50,From the nice room to our food once again was awesome. The slots were friendly too... the staff is always great... I will be back again soon... next time we will be by the pool ... the location makes it perfect place to stay
50,I picked this hotel because of the high ratings and it did not deceive my family received the best customer service from the check-in until we had to reluctantly check-out. The rooms were clean the casino offered great gambling we partied at the lounge area and had a great meal at The Costa. By far the pool area was the best hands down we had so much fun playing in the pool and the hot tub was so relaxing. We are already making plans for our next trip to Vegas and we will be staying at The Mirage.
30,...but the hotel is 30 years old and is in need of some some general cleaning and minor repairs. Great location in the middle of the strip so would probably stay again if I got a decent price. Otherwise I'd try a newer hotel.
40,Met friends in Vegas. Everyone from valet to check in to concierge provided excellent customer service. The Mirage is a good location and easy to walk to other casinos. My favorite part was Love! This was my third time seeing it and it was Amazing as always.
30,"The check in was more difficult than expected as a MGM employee. The room key was never activated for parking. The room had the entire carpet wet and when I call the front desk they only apologized for the inconvenience but didn't offered to solve the issue. I was definitely not ""WOW"" by the Mirage Hotel and Casino."
30,Stayed in king bed with strip view.This room also over looked the the large pool. The bathroom door was in the way from using the toilet and getting in/out the shower. Would probably get a junior suite or larger room that has a different layout if we stay again.
50,We have stayed at the Mirage on several visits - we love the location. Excited to have made a return visit (last visit March 2020) and were delighted to encounter great service from check-in (used app but wanted a key card) restaurants and especially pool staff.
50,Everything about the mirage was awesome. Good food great hotel and even better casino atmosphere. I would recommend the mirage to any of my friends or family. I would be perfectly fine with staying at the mirage for the rest of my Vegas vacations.
50,Wonderful clean and comfy room. Had lots of fun gaming with plenty of machines to choose from. Any staff we talked with were very helpful and courteous. Had breakfast at the restaurant near the elevators (can’t remember the name of it) and it was delicious. Go there and have some fun.
20,Booked 2 rooms for 7 nights and were placed 21 floors apart. Had 6 family members and had to go to the lobby to meet up to get to each other’s room. Hotel staff were rude when asked to change a room. Asked several times and never got it changed. Spent the week and a lot of money to stay separately from our family members for our vacation.
40,The clean and friendly accommodations were delightful especially the outdoor spaces. We would come back. Beware the Covid restrictions mandated by the state would make me thick twice. The hypocrisy is amazing.
50,After checking out early to catch 12:45am flight which got canceled I was stuck at the airport with no place to stay. So I called the Mirage who thankfully had operator that answered the phone! She spoke with her manager and they allowed me to return to my room for the night. Awesome!
50,10s in all areas. Food and Beverage options for all. Weekday cabana is a must for those looking for some exclusivity. Private massage at my cabana was both effective and extremely reasonably priced. In-room dining via The Pantry was also decently priced and a nice private options when you look for kid-free options.
40,Nice room for the price and convenient location on the strip. The Pantry restaurant had great food as well as at California Pizza Kitchen and yogurt at Blizz. Pool complex very spacious and well laid out.
10,Would not recommend - we had a blood stained towel left for us. It was disgusting. We called to complain and were only comped the resort fee. What a joke! No one took us seriously when we complained. We should’ve had our stay comped!
30,Way too much of a pain in the ass. Stay home! Too much inconvenience for a simple trip. Room was gross and not working… had to pull teeth to get comps for our crappy stay. For as much money that we spent I would think our stay would be less of a hassle. Don’t think I’ll  Stay here again
40,The location of this hotel.is very convenient to the strip. We were able to check in as early as 12:30pm when we requested at the front desk. Our room was overall clean and neat. My only complain is the toilet flush was too loud when used. Housekeeping staff are friendly. I wish they offer discount for the parking for hotel guests...its $15 per day...the positive side of the parking is its very easy to get a slot even during the most busy hours.
40,Was charged $50 for moving items in fridge to put my water in there. They wanted to charge $100 but cut it in half. Otherwise I enjoyed the stay beers cost $9.75 on the casino floor fyi. I may stay at another place next time.
40,Payouts lower than other casinos. Poor drink service. Still an overall good hotel. All of the staff were extremely friendly and polite. Our mattress was super soft which was different as we usually sleep on firm mattresses.
50,Although it didn't have a fridge we got by one thing that we didn't know if u check in with a debit card they lock the mini bar I have stayed at other hotels where my debit was use and mini bar was open
40,We enjoyed the location  the service was amazing  the only downfall we had was that the hotel room did not have a mini fridge to keep our drinks cold . Lots of machines  lots of tables  food was amazing !
50,Mirage has always been a timeless beauty too me! If you love tropical atmosphere then this is the place for you! The penthouse is amazing housekeepers are friendly property is kept clean! I’ve been coming here for over 15 years and it’s never a disappointment!
50,Easy checkin with ability to upgrade to a strip view room on request. Room ready on arrival. Room spacious and clean. Only wish was for more choices of restaurants open and slot machines.  Housekeeping prompt with request to clean room and bring more linens.
40,From the remote check-in to the good choice of restaurants to the location to the room size the Mirage was a perfect choice for our girls trip to celebrate a birthday. I like that the hotel is not overly large so it was never excessively crowded.
40,Even though the property has shown its age but it still shows its once glorious past. Casino is busy and packed. People seem to have a good time. Room rate is very affordable to out visitors and its location is a primary attraction.
30,Don’t bother paying for deluxe room it’s a waste of money. It’s a basic dirty room and all are connecting rooms so you are hearing all your neighbors. Rooms in need of serious repairs and dirty. Ac was cold during the day and hot all night no matter what we did. Tub dirty shower door broken hole in the wall by the bed. Keycard lock battery dying and chirped all day/night
30,the money wasn't worth it. I could have gone anywhere else for this vacation. the room was okay but the food and other services were just too below standard. we really looked forward to our vacation.
30,The pool area was really nice and the room was fine for a good price. However the restaurants were way too expensive. We had to pay almost 100 dollars for breakfast for 3 people (room service Pantry). The Heritage restaurant charged my son almost 50 dollars for a steak. When it arrived it appeared on a white plate in the center with absolutely nothing else. He said the steak wasn't even that great. No vegetable or garnish even.  The internet in the room was ridiculously slow. All in all a disappointment.
50,I had my 51th celebrated in this property Mirage Hotel Casino. The check in process was very fast. Customer service experience was amazing  Our room views was in the front of the Venetian and Palazzo one of my wishlist to check in someday.Overall expectations of this Hotel was excellent.
50,I enjoyed my room it was clean and smell nice. The bell boy service was helpful and considerate. The room service was fast and efficient. The restaurant's I ate at were delicious fastand clean. The staff on the floor was helpful kind and considerate. I always hit a jackpot. I love the reward play.
50,Without a doubt the Maroge has the best pool on the strip. The bar service is good as are all other services provided by staff.Evan at desk services was particularly helpful and deserves special attention. He was incredibly patient and polite.
50,The Mirage was the perfect place to escape to for a long weekend. A beautiful pool quality shows the dolphin habitat excellent service and great food all made it a memorable weekend. I would recommend the Mirage for anyone visiting Vegas. And don’t forget like we almost did to step outside and watch the volcano show at night! There was so much to offer visitors at the Mirage hotel. I wouldn’t hesitate to visit again.
40,The common areas are great- pool restaurants shops shows....  However the rooms need attention. Some of them are musty smelling and need repairs. In addition many of the rooms could use some updating.
50,We love the MIrage the hotel is beautiful the staff amazing. There are very fine restaurants here as well and the location on the strip is perfect. Our host Willie Haddock is the best. Cannot wait to go back!
10,It’s just a regular hotel room. Nothing special. We’ve stayed in other hotels in the strip that are much nicer and not as expensive. The pool area is not very large. Most of it is taken up by the dolphin encounter that guests must pay $25 extra to visit. The restaurant food is bad and way overpriced. Breakfast for two was $60 and was not good. We rented movie and it kept buffering. No coffee maker in room and can’t use fridge or be charged for items if you touch them.
50,My stay at the Mirage Hotel was absolutely amazing. This hotel provides everything you need. All the staff are professionals and they go over and beyond for their customers! If you want nice clean and exceptional service book at the Mirage!
50,Clean comfy rooms  Helpful friendly staff  Delicious meals at CPK  Lovely pool n daybeds with great music  Masks well enforced throughout  Blizz frozen yogurt n Roasted Bean had great choices n were handy near the pool  Pool staff was very helpful  Would love to come back again soon
50,Hadn't stayed at Mirage in over 4 years no reason just worked out that way. The rooms were nice beds were outstanding didn't want to get out. Had a wonderful time didn't win big but what else is new had fun though. I go to enjoy the games slots food and drink and did all that. My only complaint is the table games that use to be $5 minimum are now $10 - $25 minimum almost everywhere. I understand they were shut down for awhile but a lot of people were out of work too. A little consideration for regular people especially in the daytime would be nice. We played some table games but not near as much as we use to.    One of the best margaritas I have ever had was at the Sports Bar by a bartender named Cesar went there every night we were there the whole staff at that bar were friendly and fun.    Had a great stay hope to go back next year.
40,We enjoyed the mirage. The pool was awesome and beautiful. Our shower and tub drain though was extremely slow and needed to be snaked. The hair dryer vent was really plugged so it smelled hot. The mattress was a little too soft for us. But the hotel itself was beautiful and food was good. The cirque du soleil Beatles show was wonderful and any seat would be great for viewing it!! It was amazing!!!
50,Great pool amazing rooms super friendly staff! Great food amazing snacks! Very centrally located to everything on the strip! Easy to get to any other hotel if you needed to but I highly doubt you would need to leave the Mirage    Thank you
20,This place is not what it used to be. Rooms need a serious upgrade when compared to all the other hotels nearby room smelled of mold bathroom was tiny customer service was not helpful at all bed matresses need a serious upgrade way over priced for what it has become. The rooms at the Flamingo are way nicer and half the price!
50,Hotel has everything you need - centrally located on strip the pool area is one of the best - splurge on the upgraded chair beds - worth every penny!! The property is well-kept and won’t break your bank account - staff is super helpful and friendly !
40,Location is great and the hotel is updated and clean. The pool was great but a little crowded with lounge chairs. You’re right next to Caesars Palace and in the middle of the strip. My husband and I used to be MGM hotel goers but always felt too far to the side of the strip. This location is great and the hotel is close to the quality of the MGM.
40,I have been to Vegas about 30 times but this was my first stay at the Mirage. The location is excellent as it is close to many other casinos. The food everywhere I ate was fantastic. The service everywhere was also terrific. I stayed in a Mirage suite and the room was very average. It wasn't terribly clean and it just felt old and outdated. The Sportsbook was very nice and spent a lot of time there. I also play slots and I did not enjoy their selection of machines so when I wanted to play them I went to another casino Overall I did enjoy my stay and would probably stay there again due to the location food and sportsbook. I just know I would go to another casino for slot play. Hopefully they will update the rooms soon as they appear to need a makeover.
30,"Stayed at Mirage 20 years ago. remember it being great. Looked forward to a return but was somewhat disappointed. Place no longer had that ""wow"" factor. Pool was very nice. Drinks and food are overpriced. I will check out other options before returning to Mirage."
40,The hotel & staff were great. The European pool was a huge let down. The pictures show a very sultry sophisticated atmosphere. Its more like a frat party where the ratio is 3 to 1 guys to girls & their waiting for your wife to take off her top. Its blasting rave music & its not a comfortable situation at all. The reason is they allow single men in. There are also single men hanging around the entrance to get a look at your lady on the way in. They do this just around the corner from the entrance so the staff doesn't notice. As everywhere in the hotel the staff at Bare Pool was polite & professional they can only work with what they have. The rules need to change. No single men would solve this issue overnight. As it stands Bare pool lounge is no lounge at all.
30,I have only stayed at 3 resorts in Vegas & the mirage at this time is at the bottom of the list. It in a great location & fire show that in front of the hotel was pretty cool. However not much to it but a place to sleep.
50,The hotel is great comfortable clean rooms fabulous location. The casino all the available restaurants friendly helpful staff great service. We would definitely stay at this hotel again and again. Absolutely loved our stay.
30,Convention stay. Hotel fine but lacked luster. The staff friendly throughout the hotel resort pool nice and relaxing but my food was never delivered to me - had to finally go pickup and no adjustment made to bill food was cold. The AC worked moderately well - did not seem to cool as well after 1st day -
40,The view from the 21st floor was awesome. Room was clean but showed lots of signs of wear but the beds were comfy and Pool area is very good service excellent but not set up for little kids. We go to Vegas once a year see shows eat out relax. Be prepared for sticker shock! Pool drinks $20-$25 Dinner at in house specialty Restaurants $125-250 a couple w/o liquor. Not a criticism just the sign of times for major strip hotels. Table mins. now up to $15 during the day $20 at night if your a gambler. The Mirage location on the strip is great to go to other venues to see shows etc. As they say in Real Estate Locaton Location Location!
20,Black mold in the bathroom and overall room wasn’t clean. Bed wasn’t very comfortable and the pillows were like sleeping with a sheet. We were happy with location but I won’t be returning to stay at the mirage.
50,Staff were all friendly and efficient. Digital check-in and check-out via the MGM app was super simple. Elevators are keycard controlled which lends itself to safety. Multiple food and beverage outlets on site providing options for every palate. Hotel is located right smack in the middle of the strip right in the heart of all the action. Great location if you're looking to experience multiple hotels casinos nearby shows etc. The property was in fine condition but you could tell the hotel has some older bones. Still very well maintained and nothing that would lead me to select another property. You just know this is one of the original greats when it comes to Vegas hotels.
50,Great staff clean rooms & love the atmosphere.. Everyone was so nice & welcoming came in from driving over 2000 miles from visiting several National Parks & to get to a clean room comfortable bed & shower was the best!!
50,This is a nice hotel our room was a volcano view room. It defiantly was that! We could see the strip and volcano every night. The only problem with the hotel is the wi-fi is horrible! I could only get reception in the room about 10% of the time. The hotel is older and their wi-fi capabilities aren't up to par. Also there is no coffee in room to make in the morning that is a little frustrating when you want it in the morning.
50,The entire staff were Amazing! The Hotel was perfect Central location. Amazing! From the Valet to the Team at the front desk to Room Service... the best trip we have ever had! We were planning our next trip before we left.
10,Room was clean but not worth the price. We tried to upgrade as directed during check-in but fully booked in Oct. Restaurants were overpriced and low quality. Best experience was service at the Pantry breakfast. We had to wait in line to go to the pool at 9am in the morning only to find no chairs available pool side b/c the hotel rents them out rather than opening them up to paying guests.
50,Visited Vegas in Sept. and stayed at the Mirage for the first time. It was a great experience. My husband and I and four of our friends were on the trip. The rooms were super clean housekeeping came every day of our four day stay. Staff was helpful and gracious. The whole casino was clean check in was orderly and quick. Would definitely recommend this casino resort and would stay there again Kristine Paul
50,We had another great experience. Good food. Good slots. Great rewards staff. Fabulous entertainment. We have stayed here three times and will return. It is a consistently good experience all around. The location is great and an easy walk to many other iconic Las Vegas Casinos.
40,room was nice and quiet. casinos music was way too loud all the time had to go somewhere else after a awhile for peace and quiet. 15.00 per day parking is ridiculous when you can park at treasure island  for free.
50,The Mirage is our favorite property in LV. From the front desk crew to housekeeping to bartenders to the quality of your room their level of service is impeccable. The pool is probably the best in all of Vegas and the free volcano show each night is the best attraction for all ages in my opinion. The granddaddy of the Las Vegas mega resorts is stronger than ever after all these years.
50,The strip is just a few steps away! Shin Lim was fantastic! Donny is right across the street! So many close fun activities and sights!  The Pantry has top notch breakfast! California Pizza Kitchen and Stack were delicious!  You will not regret your stay at The Mirage!
50,Our trip was perfection. It was our first visit to Vegas. The gambling floor was lively with plenty of available games and drinks were always available on the floor. We ate at two of the in-house restaurants Tom’s Heritage Steakhouse and Otoro Sushi which both blew away our expectations. The hotel rooms were clean and housekeeping is always prompt and respectful. We can’t wait to get back to the Mirage!!
50,The pools treatment and bartenders ie Jaks at main bar at pool.at Mlife counter Supreme service for Q and A never left in a Learch .Felt like a KING!!! I’m Comming  Back in August in 2022 FOR SURE SEE YOU THEN WHIT Many Thanks.
50,The pool area was really nice restaurant had very good fresh food and not to prices the location is very good on the strip in the middle so you could walk to about anywhere on the strip close to tram casino was nice they kept cleaning the slots felt safe
50,Place was clean room beds were soft service was great I definitely would come back to this hotelYour steakhouse was fabulous best steak I ever had and again I can’t tell you how nice it was to have a clean bed the beds were very soft and great
50,We love everything about the Mirage—centralized so everything is close by. Great restaurants awesome casino the cocktail waitresses are very attentive too. Sad because we didn’t get to go to the pool  but we will next time!!
50,We love the Mirage! Easy to get around the hotel great pools and lots of food choices! Central location on the strip! The suites and guest rooms are easy to get to and you don’t have to walk forever.
40,Having stayed at the Mirage for many years prior to this year and to Covid we recently had the pleasure of a 6 night stay for our first time back since Aug 2019. I am happy to say the Pandemic did not stop the Mirage from excelling.. The hotel is cleaner service was spot on better then ever actually no lack of help or employees was evident at all. Restaurants were open and filled meals were great and served with a smile.. Casino was alive and clean machines were abundant. Table games were open friendly dealers. space for everyone. The Pool area which is the best on the strip was clean no cups cans or trash left poolside as was in the past.. Rooms were clean Bed was very comfortable the only tiny negative thing is that the drapery does not close all the way and it can Never be completely dark in the room if that is your thing to sleep. The decor in the rooms needs some TLC and I am begging for a fridge (which you can rent at 40/day and a coffee maker to be added to the rooms) but overall for the amount of time you are in the room they fit the bill. If the rooms ever get remodeled The Mirage will be the premier spot for sure.. Keep up the good work I am hoping to see more Positive changes when I return.
50,Our stay at Mirage was incredible! We had the friendly lady check us in! Her & my husband we’re talking while waiting for me to get to the front desk since it was under my name! Come to find out when we got to our room she had upgraded us to the 2 bedroom suite!! It was incredible the view outside our window was so amazing!! We can’t wait to come back!
50,Clean and modern room the entire place is up to date and the casino has a great vibe and awesome music. Pool is easily top 5 in Vegas. Lots of dining choices. Front desk offered upgrade without even having to ask.
50,The customer service was the best through out the resort. Room was exceptionally clean. Food was very good in all venues. Pool area was inviting and great drinks. Casino and sports betting area on point. Traveled by myself and felt safe and comfortable during my stay. Did not get the chance to go to a show. If you meet Craig at check he stands at the roped area as a greeter tell him Rose said hello!
30,Had a great trip but the air in our room did not work. They tried to fix 5 or 6 times but they didn't. They where to orovide a limo to the airport but it it never arrived so we had to take a cab so we would not be late for our flight. Other then those two things it was a good trip.
50,This hotel always delivers exceptional quality. It is also the ONLY hotel on the strip (that I know of) that has a whirlpool in the pool area. I hope they NEVER get rid of it. It is located in the heart of the strip so it makes moving about so much easier. The hotel is clean and has great amenities.
50,Casino Host Will Haddick is the best at making sure that you well taken care of and all your needs are met. The VIP staff is very friendly and professional helpful. The casino is very clean and full of fun slots and table games hosted by a friendly staff. The restaurants are very nice and the food is great.
50,This is a beautiful hotel and casino. Great location. The pool is awesome. The prices are reasonable. The staff were friendly and professional. The sports book is really nice. We will definitely be back
20,Our toilet was broken mini bar locked  after two days of engineering trying to fix the toilet we were moved to another room that was musty & had ripped sheets . No upgrades after the hassle  & this was for our honeymoon which we informed the staff each time we had to go down & tell them our toilet still wasn’t working . We easily wasted 3 hours waiting in line  talking about the issues & then moving rooms. Not worth it  go watch the volcano show outside  but don’t waster you’re money staying here
30,My husband & I arrived at the hotel early evening hours. We were there for a few days business trip. There was a good size line to check in & only two people behind the counter. Given the current times I completely under placed are understaffed & change is happening in the check in process. I don’t like it but I understand that’s not going to change. So there was a couple of gentlemen running around looking for people who were checking that were not flipping through legit three ring binders pulling out printed paper confirmation. I was one of the people just standing in line phone & credit card in hand. One of the gentleman approached & asked checking in & a few other questions. He then did some things on his tablet & told me I could self check in. I had read on the website there was an option to not get a room key & use your phone to check in. I don’t know about you but my phone always seems to be dead. So I said but I need room keys. He said you can make them when you check in. Again I know I’m not going to change this but it pissed me off. We are paying higher prices for things & now donating labor to all these companies as well. I go to check in & make my keys now that I’m an instant volunteer working for the giant MGM conglomerate. We go to our room which is on a lower floor. No human no option to request a room higher up. So I already don’t care for what’s happening. Then we arrive at our room to find a dirty tissue on the nightstand next to the bed in our supposedly clean room. I call the front desk. I’m on hold for 15 minutes. Then the gal comes on & I tell her there is a dirty tissue on the nightstand next to the bed in our supposedly clean room. She says “oh my god that’s so disgusting. I’ll send someone to clean the room. “ Oh good because I have complete faith that it will be clean this time around. I was ready to leave at point but I stayed.  I have to tell you this is one of the noisiest hotels. In our room with the tv on you hear the ac units street noise & every night it would sound like something got angry. It was the volcano out front that goes off nightly. It’s fun to see & I enjoy watching it but if you are relaxing in your room it’s not a good.  Another nightly occurrence was the doors to the rooms. I don’t know about you but I’m not a light sleeper but there is some noises I’m programmed to hear even while sleeping & one of them is the sound of the door to room being messed with. It would start making the electronic noise it makes when you hold the key card up to it & turns green to let you into the room. It’s like they would cycle every night. You could hear it start at one end & go all the way down the hall. This would go on for quite some time.  Some good things about the stay…  There is Starbucks in the hotel. I need decent coffee in the morning & after dinner. It was nice having a place in the hotel.  The restaurants in the hotel were really good! I mean really good.  The Still was our favorite! It’s a bar/restaurant style. The food is made in an airstream style food truck at the back of the restaurant. It was an amazing atmosphere & incredible food.  We also enjoyed a dinner at Diablos Cantina. Also really good food.  We did our breakfast at the Pantry. Again the food did not disappoint. It was very good.  One thing I will note is while food is amazing the staff was not great. Not super friendly & not great service. Yes I know they may be at day 4356 in a row without a day off & doing their best. Which is why I just wanted to mention it but not go into detail.  Overall as we checked out & made our way through the casino floor through the lobby outside to wait for our ride to the airport; we reflected on our stay.  My thought was I don’t ever need to stay there again. I didn’t love it. Now with being said it doesn’t mean I will never stay there again. It just means it not on my favorites lists.  We are in Vegas 3+ times a year & love staying at different hotels to check them out. This was our first time staying at the Mirage. It may not be our last time staying there. It wasn’t so terrible I swore the place off. It just one of the I don’t need to ever stay there again.
20,Our room smelled housekeeping walked into our room 3 different times when we had a privacy sign on the handle. Our honeymoon i had to stay alert in case someone would try to come in. Which sucked !!!
50,"Excellent customer service from our initial interaction with Nicole who arranged our room after a very disappointing ""automatic check-in"" on the 2d floor to others like Leshlie (box office) and Dianna at the Mlife booth Christian the valet who offered to take our picture in front of the waterfall and last but not least the excellent cocktail waitress (older lady with wavy blonde hair) whose name eludes me but she totally remembered what we drank each night (cran/vodkas) we were there (four nights)! Though I lost big it would've been more disappointing without the gracious smiles and attitudes by an extremely courteous staff."
40,There was alot to do at the mirage they have good food the sports book is great good customer service the drink waitresses at the slots were very nice the staff at the mlife desk were very nice and helpful
30,Room was not clean upon check in. Hair in sink and toilet. Something really sticky on entry room floor. Following days were fine. Would’ve been nice to have a place to sit that wasn’t at a game table slot machine or restaurant.
50,This Hotel was very clean safe and staff was very friendly. It was worth every penny spent. They are also very quick at removing any unwanted visitors like the homeless which I saw very seldom during my stay.
50,Loved the place. Room was great pool and restaurants were awesome! They have a dolphin show though we didn't take advantage of it. We were there for a business conference and even the food at the conference was awesome!
50,Very clean areas in casino. Respectful and helpful staff thru out hotel. This was our honeymoon destination and we're very pleased in the entire weekend that we spent. I would highly recommend this Hotel/Casino.
50,The Mirage has not signature scent which is not overwhelming. The shows are fantastic and shouldn't be missed when staying at this resort. Nice shops and restaurants and the staff are very friendly! It is worth staying at The Mirage!
40,This was the last night of an 8-day road trip. We wanted to see “Love” Cirque du Soleil and it made sense to stay at the Mirage. This was our second stay there. I was appalled at the amount of smoke (cigs and cigars) permeating the entire ground floor. I thought the ventilation systems in Vegas had improved. Of course it affects the restaurants and the dining experience. It felt like a throwback to the 80s. It was a very crowded Saturday night I’ll give it that. Otherwise The Mirage is a lovely property and “Love” is not to be missed if you are a Beatles fan.
50,Great Beatles show. Nice room friendly staff. We stayed on the 25th floor and had a nice view overlooking the strip. We also had our own elevator taking us to the top two floors which made us feel special. One of the security guards even volunteered to take our picture downstairs. Fun trip.
40,One of our favorites. Great friendly staff. Great pool. Many options available. Shops restaurants .Clean room.Very kind and patient room service. Location! Walgreens Outback Dennys White Castle and McDonald's right across the street. Great natural light. A very tropical fresh resort feel with a good casino. We look forward to dining here next time and checking out the dolphin habitat and shows. Viva!
30,When the staff tells you they're unable to fix a problem but other M life properties fixed the same problem previously it makes you wonder. On the phone with M Life staff in house with M Life staff and the staff unable to resolve.
50,This is my favorite hotel on the Vegas strip. The amenities are fabulous from the pool to the choice of restaurants. The casino is very clean and spacious as well as the guest rooms. We always check out the other casinos while in town but we continue to come back to the Mirage.
50,Everything was perfect-room/staff/services. We will only consider staying at the Mirage for all our Vegas vacations. Shout out to our host-Marty Grigg-who always goes above and beyond to ensure our vacation is memorable!
50,The Mirage is a great hotel. It is not dated like many on the strip. It is clean comfortable and has a great casino. Some hotels are so large you feel like a room number but it is more personal at the Mirage.
40,In town for convention and Mirage was where I stayed. App was good for the check in experience didn't talk to anyone was able to get my room and check in and out. Location I think is great and right across from the Monorail station. Casino was clean and restaurants were all open. Didn't get to see any shows but overall for the value and everything else was not disappointed. There are newer hotels but this one although is dated is well kept and lots to do.
50,Excellent choice location on the strip restaurants cleanliness staff shows all tight in the hotel and walking distance to many of the other popular hotels and venues. The rooms were spacious snd well stocked with beverages.
20,The view was very nice but when we complained about the room being dirty. The manage didn`t want to do anything about the room. He stated that the hotel was booked and he didn`t offer anything else to us. There was hair in the bathroom the soap dish tub and the toilet was not clean at all and there was bugs in the room..
50,We had a fantastic stay in September 2021 at The Mirage. The location is phenomenal right in the heart of The Strip and the tram to next-door Treasure Island is a nice touch. We dined at Otoro (PHENOMENAL) had a lovely pool day (we booked in the Oasis which is the adults-only private pool behind the bar and that was also wonderful) spent a lot of time hopping around the casino floor and using the casual bars and restaurant options. Overall we loved it - and we even were able to get a glimpse of the volcano erupting from our room!
40,I attended a convention here and enjoyed my overall stay. The food quality was good for convention crowds. The pool is awesome and always a treat. The Beatles LOVE show was amazing and is a must see. Thanks!
40,This was my first stay at The Mirage and just like my many other MGM property stays in Vegas it was fantastic. The check-in process was painless rooms were spotless amenities were amazing and the staff were friendly.
10,Terrible experience  First of; I booked a king size bed with three other reservation with the same name but the check in lady was saying no; i told her to check my reservation; she was not she talked to her manager also did not help; they were very unfriendly  The room very old  Shower dirty and broken  No power cord at the working desk (non sense designer)
30,I felt that our room really showed its age. It felt run down and out of date compared to other properties. The Mirage has a lot to offer however our room felt like it was overdue for a remodel. The trim on the walls was damaged or even missing in some places. There was a lack of wall outlets I was unable to charge my phone on the night stand. The shower head did not adjust and sprayed with such pressure that it was almost painful. The bathroom was completely ineffective.Other than our room we really enjoyed the property.
30,The hotel was average and clean but when I checked in I set something on the counter of my hotel room and it fell over and hit the wood box that’s holding the snacks water and a phone charger. I then late saw that I was charged $30 because it set off the sensor in the wood box and they charged me for it. I asked to be refunded and the front desk associate said no. Do not touch any of the stuff to buy in the rooms.
20,Very bad experience all the way around not worth the money I spent on it. Terrible view out the room window. Had to wait after I checked in to get the room took over an hour had to wait until it was ready. Wouldn’t recommend
10,Payed for volcano view- arrived saw no volcano. Called front desk - they said i should be able to see it… night time arrived i saw the top was missing! Waste of money and kids were sad about it. Room was not impressive fixtures dirty restroom dusty.
50,The Mirage continues to be a leader in offering great service to its visitors. Offering a private service to us Canadians to have Covid testing done in our room prior to check out was a deal breaker for us . Another example of the high quality of service always available . The casino was so clean and everyone so friendly ! Excellent food and service at The Paradise Cafe . Would love to see a spot for coffee and desserts ! The VIP lounge hours could be Extended for coffee in the early am prior to pool opening .
40,All of the hotel staff and shop & restaurant staff were very friendly. Overall the place was always being cleaned and I typically avoid staying in casinos bc of the smoke but the Mirage wasn't too bad.
50,We had a great location for the shows we saw (O and Aces of Comedy) and we all had a great time. We went with other friends the guys went to Nascar and we saw 3 shows at at Heritage and had a great time overall. We frequent Vegas and like the location of the Mirage and the Bellagio best.
50,Hotel was great and the Beatles Love did not disappoint. Restaurants were all wonderful. When encountered the staff was extremely helpful. Casino floor was always hopping and I had lots of fun while there.
50,Staying at the Mirage in Vegas has been a positive experience for the third time! The staff the Casino restaurants pool and hotel rooms are all wonderful! The Mirage is in a great location along the Strip.I will be back soon!
30,The conference facilities at Mirage are very nice but the guest rooms are a lot to be desired. This hotel needs a renovation in a bad way. I initially reserved an upgraded room in the tower and it smelled so horrible with smoke anc cherry air freshener that I requested a room change. Relocated to the regular king room and the smell was much better but the room needs an update. I will say the front desk staff was extremely accommodating in relocating me and my colleague and even gave us a $150 meal credit for our stay.
50,Great environment and a lot of fun. I bet a lot of money and made some. I loved the ambiance of the casino. Hotel room was clean and noteworthy.    Looking to make this my hotel destination on future trips to Las Vegas. Aloha
30,I had purposely booked a tower suite to have a quieter/nicer room and did not get that. I was put right next to the elevators which kept me up and the room still had beer cans by the chair and curtain. The chair was disgusting and worn and the room was ready for an update. Wouldn’t recommend for what I paid.
40,The service at Mirage from checking to my room was excellent the only down side to Casino is dealers are mostly lack manners several made issues when you would attempt to move tables with your chips
40,1st time I have stayed here but it won't be my last. Nice room friendly staff SNACKS open late for food...and very good too.  In the heart of the STRIP and a great location with world class shopping malls in walking distance in either directions.
10,Wow the Mirage is in desperate need of a renovation (or at the very minimum a deep clean). I understand Covid was (is!) rough on the hospitality industry) but cleanliness should be the top priority even if the carpet is unraveling and 100% of the pool chaise lounges need replaces. The bar for cleanliness was on the floor for the Mirage. Vegas gets expensive yet for a bit more money you 100% can find a better fresher and cleaner hotel and casino option. The Mirage's single saving grace is their kind helpful friendly staff - universally across the property. If the guests don't deserve the upgrades then at least the staff deserve a better property as their work environment... And finally to be fair their location on the strip is pretty great.
50,"Oh my goodness! Everything was wonderful and everyone was very helpful & friendly! We'll only stay at the Mirage when we return to Vegas for the next birthday or any celebration! And will recommend it to every family members business colleagues & friends! Great location! Great price for the ""Stay Well"" rooms! Great options for everything your heart desires! Trip was me my mom & husband to celebrate their birthdays. Hubby's first time. Mom & I were last in Vegas 35 years ago! Can't even remember where we stayed back then but will never forget The Mirage!"
20,I would not go back to this hotel. It is old and tired and rooms not updated for years. 3 Lamps not working air cond. not good and only 2 outlets available to charge phones/computer/ipad. No technical availability. Upgraded to Tower rooms - the same room only higher. Smokers made it difficult to breathe and some spray they used for the rooms made it worse. Convention facilities okay and a bit more modern. Service from staff very nice and they worked hard to please guests. I felt they should have had more security as the halls on room floors very long and didn't feel safe if alone.
40,Recently stayed here for the 2021 Commercial Real Estate Women's Network convention. The rooms were nice and the pool was refreshing. I'd gladly stay here again in the near future and suggest it to any other travellers.
50,The Mirage is a great resort! Perfect size not too big plenty of restaurants and easy access to the strip in a great central location on the Strip. The beds were super comfortable (one of my best sleeps!). The pool is relaxing with waterfalls which makes you feel like you are in a tropical garden. The service all around was great.
30,I've stayed in a few hotels now in Vegas and so far the Mirage has been my least favourite. A+ on friendliness of the staff location and conference facilities...slightly underwhelmed on the space itself and most definitely my room upon check in.    The room itself smelled of very heavy smoke...so I called the front desk to see if I was accidentally placed on a smoking floor..?!?! Guest Services advised me all rooms and floors were non smoking...clearly the guests before me didn't know this!    There were no bath towels in my room...only one washcloth and one hand towel. I don't mind only having one face and hand towel so much...but no towels...?!?!?! I was missing a glass in my room and it seemed as if the stock of sundries they left me (to purchase in room) was also only partially stocked.    It seemed actually as if housekeeping came in cleaned up a bit and then closed the door forgetting to re stock!    I also noticed one morning while getting dressed that the picture on the wall had something sprayed spilled or spewed all over it at one point and it left a mess of whatever it was all over the inside of the frame surrounding the canvas...was really kinda gross but I was able to overlook it for the remainder of my stay!    All in all very nice space and exceptionally friendly staff - just lacking attention to detail in the space where I should feel the most clean and at ease.
30,The rooms do not have simple things like coffee maker OR microwave. Most of the restaurants are closed. One of the main attractions the white tigers are gone. Overall it was not a great experience most likely will not stay at the Mirage next time.
40,Great hotel. Well appointed. Awesome steakhouse. Beds are VERY firm but everything else is top notch. The barcode reader on the Parking system is challenging to get it to read your phone. Seems like it would be an easy fix.
40,The title says it all in comparison to other hotels I've stayed at on the strip. On the plus side I felt very secure because you can only access the floor you are staying on with your key (not just anyone can get in). Also you don't have to leave the hotel for anything unless you want to. It's like being on a cruise!
50,I’ve been going to this hotel for many years. It just gets better and better every single time. They have the best pool the best staff great restaurants and best of all the property is located right smack in the middle of the strip where all the action is. This time around I found tables that were reasonable. Overall dollar for dollar this is your best hotel.
10,It's hard to feel like a welcome guest when the first thing you hear is pay me for parking. I will always leave a bad review when I feel like I've been nickel and dimed. Add Parking and Resort fee to the cost of the room and quit making things more complicated than needed.
50,Always know that I will have quality clean and high end accommodations at the Mirage. Along with that the staff is the friendliest and most helpful on the Strip. Excellent excellent restaurants within great pool with good chaise lounge or private cabana rental at the adult pool which is quiet and serene.
50,We had a wonderful experience at the Mirage and will stay there every time we are in town. From the front desk staff to the cleanliness of the hotel was perfect. This hotel makes your stay very comfortable and the restaurants are all great!
10,Do not check your bags there once you check out. Bags were unavailable for 2 hours causing me to miss my flight.  No one was about to help me get my bags from the hotel. They only reimbursed me with food and drink that I did not use. This could have been handled in a much different manner and should have never been a problem. Completely unacceptable.
50,Excellent stay! I will be back! Exceptional staff from front desk security housekeeping and even maintenance. I did not venture out much as everything I needed was right there and I felt very comfortable.
50,The Mirage is by far the best hotel we’ve been to in Las Vegas. Everything about our stay there was exceptional and the staff was very helpful and friendly. We will definitely return on our next trip.
50,I can’t rave about the pool experience enough! Gorgeous palm trees waterfalls and a few hot tubs spread out. To call this a pool is an understatement as it’s more liken to a small lagoon. Plenty of space to spread out in water and lots of lounge chairs available. Pool servers were prompt with food and drink orders and you can scan a QR code with your phone from lounge chair you’re sitting in and order direct. Could’ve spent the whole day there. Will most definitely be going back.
50,Very pleased. The rooms were comped but would pay if need to next time. I highly recommended with friends and family. Will definitely be staying at the mirage again. Very clean great staff and nice rooms. Only downfall was the size of the bathroom.
50,Anyone going to Las Vegas will enjoy all of the Mirage. From the food rooms cleanliness checkout parking and assistance. Questions are answered room keys are easy to use. It is a central location for enjoying the many sights available.
20,In today's electrical device age no improvements to the rooms. Broken USB and electrical outlets at the skinny desk. Only other outlet was behind night stand. Housekeeping does not check for hangers in closet open safe minibar prices and broken outlets.
10,Was given a room with a leaky bathroom that took 2 days to resolve and get a new room. The property is getting old and it shows. One of the things I loved about this property was that it had a poker room gone this trip.
50,I stayed at the Mirage for business. The check in process took awhile but as everywhere else I am sure they are dealing with a shortage. When I got up to the desk the staff was very friendly and helped me out with a few things that I had forgot. I ordered room service and the staff was so friendly and personable. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Everyone I came in contact with went above and beyond. Will stay here again!
50,Have been to LV 20+ times and my first time staying at the Mirage property and I have already booked my next stay. Great atmosphere with everything you need at one casino. Highly recommend to everyone to experience.
40,This hotel location is great because it's in the middle of the strip. The Hotel is not so big that you get lost in it or a mile to get out the front door. I was disappointed that they closed their poker room. Seems that is happening at all the hotels. All the restaurants have great food. The staff was friendly and the room are a good size and beds a comfortable. Don't know why they can't give you a mini frig. The games hotels play.
10,We’ve enjoyed previous stays there. We had multiple issues during this stay (no not Karen type issues). We kindly tried to resolve each one (plumbing billing etc…). Each time nothing was fixed. Sadly we love this hotel but had the worst luck with the room during this trip. Imho they are too busy with the post covid boom to care
50,The Mirage is an extremely well run hotel. I have been going since I was 15 years old. I went down for my 34th birthday this weekend and it is still pretty awesome after all these years. I always recommend this hotel to everyone that go to Vegas.
50,The Mirage was the first Vegas resort my wife and I stayed at some 30 years ago. Our recent visit was a reminder of what a great time you can have there. The staff was friendly and responsive. The rooms are updated and clean. The sportsbook viewing is some of the best on the strip. Would definitely stay again!
50,Quick weekend trip to Vegas was great due to the staff at The Mirage. Quick check in staff was always cleaning around the hotel. Never a long wait at any of the restaurants even due to UFC NASCAR and the Raider game going on that weekend.
50,I arrived very early and they still got me a room so I could rest. The customer service there is awesome and the rooms were very nice for the money. Everything was very clean and modern. My room had a view of the volcano which was a plus.
50,Nice property - nothing fancy but the bed was comfy and the shower worked great! No lotion provided so be sure to bring your own! Location is great for Sands Convention Center and any place else on the strip you're inclined to walk to. Didn't eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel as the one I wanted to try (Stack) was closed on the day I had free to myself.
40,Beds are amazing rooms are very clean wish the guest elevator was closer to the entrance so we didn't have to drag luggage all the way through the casino get a tangible room key because the wifi/bluetooth is bad and i couldn't get into my room or make the elevator move to my floor several times.
50,Jake - the sports book supervisor went above and beyond to assist me. I lost my betting ticket (worth $500) and Jake took the time to roll back the cameras and match up my bet to the cameras and paid my ticket. This was on an NFL Sunday when it’s crazy busy. The mirage could have legitimately said “too bad - without the ticket you are out of luck.” The Mirage has a life long customer after that. Jake should be promoted. Also received great service from the mirage waitresses and staff In the owners VIP box seat - I highly recommend if you are a football junky - great way to overdose on football.
50,I had been in Vegas a few times but first time staying at the Mirage and love it!!  From the costumer service friendly staff clean room and everything well maintained and in working condition couldn’t ask for anything more; I’ll definitely stay here again.
50,The Mirage is a Beautiful hotel & casino even though it is an older property. I've stayed here many times and will continue to stay here. It's very clean and the pool is AMAZING.  Great location as well
40,The Mirage is still a great hotel. Yeah the rooms are a little dated but they are nice clean rooms in a great location. The tropical atmosphere is very cool. Good size casino. Nice pool with great service. Good selection of eats. And a volcano...
10,"Everything about my stay was going very well until I was no longer on the property. On the day of my checkout I realized right after my checkout time that I had left something of sentimental value locked in the safe. I called the hotel right away and I was directed to the Lost and Found. I explained the situation and was put on hold for about ten minutes. The gentleman from the Lost and Found came back on the phone and stated that there was already someone staying in the room. Because of this nothing could be done until they checked out on September 30th or unless they called someone up from Security to open the safe for them. Then my items would be given to the Lost and Found. This seemed really fishy since it was only two hours past my checkout time and it was highly unlikely that the room would already have been cleaned and turned around to be checked into again and it was still hours before check-in time. I called the front desk and it was confirmed that I was lied to about the whole situation by the man at the Lost and Found. Nobody checked into my room until more than an hour after I made my phone call. Now believe me I understand fully that I am responsible for my own items and I am the one who forgot to check the safe before leaving the hotel. But I have family still in Las Vegas who were easily prepared to stop back at the Mirage to pick up my items.    I attempted to call again today and spoke with a very pleasant young man who agreed with me that the entire situation was mishandled by the hotel staff even though I take complete ownership for my part in leaving my items. He then referred me to the Operations Manager Charlie. The entire situation was explained to Charlie and he sympathized with me. He stated that they would attempt to contact the current occupant and if they cannot get hold of them he and security would enter the room and retrieve my items. He asked for the code to the safe and said I would receive a call in a couple of hours. No such call ever came.    I called the hotel again and I was told that Charlie was off duty for the day. I then explained the whole situation to a man named Dan who stated that he would call security himself and have them retrieve my items. He said I would receive a call back within the hour. An hour and a half later I still had no call so I reached out myself. I was then told that supposedly Security attempted to retrieve my items but there was a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door so they could not enter. I was then told I needed to wait until Thursday when these people check out to see what happens.    I'm beside myself because this whole situation could have been avoided if someone could have just grabbed my items while the room was still unoccupied and I could have had my family pick it up. Again I know it is my fault for forgetting my stuff. But I'm absolutely certain that I am not the only person who has ever left something in a room and I cannot imagine that nobody staffing the Mirage has ever had enough heart to help someone have their items returned to them. I am truly disappointed to know that it seems I will have to call daily for the rest of the week and this will likely yield nothing. Basically whoever the Lost and Found guy was put me on hold for a long enough time to pretend he was looking into it for me and then blew me off. I have had much better service at lesser establishments and this totally left the worst taste in my mouth. Very disappointed."
30,No Fridge No Micro No Shower Gel No Coffee Maker. These things are and should be a bare minimum for any hotel. These days even the cheap motels provide you those amenities. The room itself was not bad but lack of basic things...
50,This was a anniversary trip from my wife and I marking 13 years of marriage we had been to Las Vegas before with a another couple and had a bad experience. So 14 years later we decided to try it again by ourselves and was excellent the best time we have ever had. I recommend staying at the mirage it's location is perfect in the center of the strip equal distance in both directions. The amenities at the mirage are amazing the pool was great and relaxing . We will definitely be returning to the mirage again soon
50,We came to Las Vegas for a business convention for airline aircrew layover hotels. The Mirage was excellent in every aspect. App check in great restaurants clean modern rooms and friendly staff. The location is perfect too. Highly recommend.
50,I had never stayed at The Mirage before as I usually stay at Cosmo Caesars or Bellagio. I found that the service quality of hotel and casino were on point. I will definitely be back again as soon as possible.
20,Maintenance door in ceiling was left wide open exposing plumbing dirt cob webs etc. 2 giant trash bags were left by maintenance or housekeeping outside door from the time we checked in to the time we checked out.
20,Was not able to check-in until after 4pm. Check-in is supposed to be at 3pm. Housekeeping was terrible. Came in and made beds but left trash and dirty towels laying on bathroom floor. Room was very hot. Even with the a/c set on 60.
30,Ok visit but the shower was not cleaned properly. Got in late and just went to sleep since I was just checking out first thing in the AM. I am sure they would have come and cleaned had I requested. Overall all other things were great with the hotel.
50,Have stayed at hotel many times but not sure what I was expecting with COVID. The hotel was so clean and comfortable. Upon entering my room you could almost smell the freshness. They got rid of the comforters and used only high grade sheets so yo u know everything on that bed is clean. House keeping did a fantastic job everyday. The front desk staff very friendly and efficient on check in and out. Many stays here over the past 25 years always enjoyable!
30,We stayed at this hotel because we've heard good things about it but the pictures were not true. We arrived at a dated hotel with a very dirty tub this should be more of a 2star hotel.  Everything is overpriced.
40,Typical rooms with above average beds. Rooms are not very quiet you think any room beside you being car swiped to enter might be your own. Pool area is nice and relaxing staff are very helpful and respectful.
40,We had a great stay at the Mirage Hotel! It was VERY CLEAN and all of the staff was AMAZING! We didn't like that was that there isn't any fridge or microwave to keep your own food or drinks in. Also the bed is very firm and the pillows are very soft and thick. I didn't sleep well at all. Not comfortable for me.
50,loved it very nice hotel and very clean and friendly. I really enjoyed my burst weekend here and will definitely be back in the future for more celebrations with family and friends. loved the casino and food places
10,Booked 2 rooms this past week. Walked in to find a used condom in our first room. Disgusting! Second room still had clothes in it from previous party. Mirage staff is not doing a good job at all of ensuring rooms are properly cleaned.  Called front desk they sent up a housekeeping person who picked up the gross used condom with toilet paper. No disinfectant of any kind.
50,The Mirage was a great place to stay. Staff was friendly professional and efficient. Hotel room was clean and mostly comfortable. The bed was a little too soft for me but not bad. Room was serviced promptly everyday a pleasant surprise. Great view of the strip we paid a little more for the strip view but worth it for our first Vegas trip. Great location on the strip easy to walk to other attractions easy rideshare pick-up spot too when needed.  Casino didn't payoff but what do you expect the house usually wins! We would stay here again.
10,This was actually one of the worst Vegas hotel rooms I have been in. I know the Mirage is one of the older MGM resorts but that does not mean the rooms should not be cleaned to a certain standard.  First of all the floors were absolutely disgusting and looked like they had not been vacuumed in weeks. Along with that there were mounds of dust sitting in all corners of the room. I’m allergic to house dust as is probably everyone else to a certain extent and I couldn’t sleep due to all of the dust being stirred up in the room.  To make matters worse the bed sheets had stains on them and I had to request for different blankets. The walls also had visible stains on them and it didn’t even look like there was an attempt to clean them. These were all the problems just related to the sleeping and common area.  The bathroom was also horrible. The light wouldn’t work unless I pressed into the reset button on the socket 6-8 times each time I wanted to turn the bathroom light on. When I called the front desk about it all they said was to just keep pressing the reset button. It sounded like this was a common issue in all of their rooms.  The shower and tub itself were not great either. The shower head had rust on it and the tub had brown spots from it being so old.  Above all we requested for housekeeping to clean the room everyday while we were away. Not only did they not clean they replaced our towels with one less everyday. This just added to the frustration of our stay. We came home late every night since we were in Vegas attending an all day and night event so we could not remediate the problem each time we came back. We were both exhausted to even try to get someone to come help with all the issues late at night. We barely stayed in the room but each time we came back just to sleep the hotel was still dirty. Just the bed was made. Again this was honestly the worst hotel I’ve stayed in Vegas. Would not recommend at all.
50,Great and courteous staff with lots of knowledge.Good service in front desk and M Life rewards. Very clean rooms with view location and parking was excellent. Good to be a M Life member because you can use comps on any of their properties. Thank you
20,We stayed 9/23-9/25. The checking was easy although we were not able to upgrade to a stay well room. The room we were given was an eternity from the elevator. Once we were in the room the air conditioning never cooled the room below 75 degrees. The micro sized bathroom was full of black mold on the walls and ceiling and inside the shower curtain. The water temp in the shower never got hot. We were in room 20-042. Stay away
50,Very nice property. Room was very nice and no signs of wear. Very clean and smelled nice. Overlooked Volcano and Strip. Everything worked no complaints. Room # 21009. The casino was well lit and no overly smoke smell.
40,Our 4 night was good. The hotel itself had plenty to do and friendly staff. Great location. It was clean overall. We had a few electrical issues with the bathroom in our room. Also the rooms themselves had paper thin walls and it was very loud throughout our stay into the night.
20,I stayed at the Mirage because of my last great experience in 2016. However five years is a long time and the property is deteriorating. The front in staff isn't as professional as I would like. They get the job done. The pit bosses are not professional and they'll talk smack about the way you play or try to dictate the way you gamble. It's not your money so lay off. Don't tell me how to gamble my hard earned money. The rooms lack outlets and it's falling apart. There was no room safe in my room. How is that possible? I would recommend paying more money and staying at a hotel. The security is very laxed with the mask mandate. So anti-mask wearers and/or anti vaxxers this is a hotel for you.
50,Great location close to everything. Beautiful tropical vibe with the best pool. We had great service from our pool waitress to the friendly younger guy by the Uber stand. The older gentleman at check in desk/line was very welcoming also. We will stay here every time we come out.
20,The bed was awful it was as shard as a rock . The rooms are outdated by a decade. The casino was ok  did not have good payout ( which didn’t expect it too) but games were older and limited variety. Food was serious expensive for mediocre food. Pool was the only thing great .
50,Need to enforce the mask rule there was more than a few people without mask walking around. We wished the Pantry would stay open later since a lot of other restaurants close by 3pm. Shin Lin show was fantastic and Colin Cloud was great.
50,Every experience at this hotel has been great. From casino to food it has been great. I would recommend this resort to anyone. I will continue to book at this location and bring others with me to vacation !!
10,My hell I have never felt so squeezed for every last penny. These resort charges are completely misleading and charging for parking for people staying there is incredible. When I spend as much money as I did there I don’t want to be charged for every damn thing over and over again. I spent 45 dollars in parking one day just because I wanted to visit stuff around town. Every time another 15 bucks and 5 minutes of my time paying for parking. Did I mention the resort fees that you get nothing from? Never again on an MGM property.
40,Was on a quick business trip. Easy reservations easy check in nice rooms pleasant staff easy parking in and out. Liked the location close to other casinos and restaurants. Beatles Love is a must.    Would stay again.
20,Got to the room it was lil dirty. We tried to clean up make the best out of it. Girlfriend went to go take a shower and she noticed mold in the shower. Went downstairs all they had to offer was a different room and some dolphin tickets. After everything was said and don't go to the pool met a white couple that had the same problem and they got 500 dollar room credit and dolphin tickets. Staff here is just careless.
50,This hotel is centrally located on the strip the staff is always friendly and the hotel is clean. I love the plants and water features in the lobby and the rooms are nice. This is my go-to strip hotel!
50,We were provided a crib at an additional cost. Our baby also enjoyed the pool plus the dolphins & tigers. We were able to walk from the hotel with stroller to the strip very easily. The restaurants at the hotel were yummy as well.
30,Forget waking up and enjoying that first cup of coffee laying in bed looking out the flooring to ceiling windows at the Las Vegas skyline. No you have to get up and get dressed brush your teeth and either order from room service (crazy expensive plus a $9 delivery charge) wait for it to arrive and let a stranger into your room with their hand out for a tip or trudge down the long hall wait for the elevator to the lobby and find a source for your precious morning coffee. Don't they get it? Room was nice enough although the bathroom was tiny and the bed was great but the lack of an in-room coffee pot is a deal breaker for me.
50,We had a fabulous time! The Mirage has delicious restaurants great gaming and a party atmosphere! Our room had an excellent view of the volcano. We got to enjoy the show whenever we wanted from the comfort of our room!
50,This was our yearly trip back to Mirage. We stay here because it’s affordable and we know our way around. It’s clean and the Oasis pool is absolutely fantastic. We rent lounge chairs and spend all day there relaxing as it’s relatively quiet (it’s only for those 21+). Highly recommend this hotel.
20,I liked the volcano view and the appearance of the room was nice. The bathroom however was another story. Hair was found on the countertop as well as the toilet bowl. The tub was clogged with hair and other unknowns and would back up when showering verify disgusting.
30,Food was too expensive and Not very tasty . Hotel was clean . But probably not a place that I would want to travel with my family again . Did notice people smoking marijuana inside in the casino . Lots of drug addicts in and around the hotel . At times I fell that I was going to get mug . Did not see enough security around .
50,Me and my peers we have received great services support & expense super great time in this beautiful facility. Great food selections nice and relax places like the garden and the dolphins area. grand selection of souvenirs and health -clothing essentials are amazing
50,For many years we have stayed at one hotel for all of our Vegas trips. We wish that we would have found out about the excellent service and amazing rooms years ago! Not only was every single team member happy that we were there - I saw them go out of their way to make sure everyone was taken care of and having a good time. From the time we arrived to the time we left both my wife and I felt appreciated and important. Getting treated in this manner will definitely make us come back to the Mirage. I want to give a shout out to Amanuel who truly went above and beyond to make our stay special- thank you so very much!!
50,Great accommodations. Work seminar was excellent and luncheon served was outstanding. Restaurants snack shop were very good. Gambled 4 nights in a row and had a lot of fun. Rooms were super comfy. Great experience overall.
50,Very nice hotel easy to navigate. Great room very clean and comfortable bed!! Awesome pool are and pool bar area. Lots of lounge chairs. Would definitely stay here again. Friendly staff. Location was great.
50,Everyone was so friendly and helpful. From booking show tickets pool reservations and where to eat on the fly.    The rooms were lovely bathroom was a bit small but had everything you need.    I’ll definitely continue to stay with this hotel.
40,Everyone at hotel was great pool was great convention center was good but cold temperatures  Was disappointed no in hotel shows to see on a Wednesday night and restaurant we wanted to go to was also closed
20,Staying at this hotel is like walking back into the 70’s and not in a good way. Never had a great meal here in the 4 days I was there. You could get better sushi at a gas station. There are better options to be had until they step up their game!
50,My friends and i decided to go to Vegas last minute. Glad we were able to book a room last minute and experience a stay at The Mirage. Thank you for the hospitality it was a great experience and i was extremely satisfied.
30,This hotel has aged quite a bit. Slot pay out was a zero. Although I did see three hand pays during my 3-day stay. One waitress seemed mad when my husband flagged her down to get a drink. I was so excited to be returning to the Mirage for another stay but unfortunately this stay was a little disappointing. Will probably never stay there again.
30,Be prepared for below average air conditioning you will not have a refrigerator in your room that you can use doors are not solid and you can hear everything in the hallway and the check in experience was definitely disappointing because we couldn’t get in until close to 4 PM
50,Thanks for your excellent price and service. It was a pleasure to stay here.!!! Room rate excellent price. Food is I reasonably priced room is always clean. All staff is friendly and courteous. Quiet atmosphere in my room at night.
50,I have stayed at the Mirage several times over the past 10 years. Restaurants gambling pool location are all great. This stay I definitely noticed an increase in efforts to clean and sanitize the rooms and hotel areas. Spacing was very comfortable. I will stay here again soon.
50,Great location to get around. All staff were helpful and courteous. No issues checking in or checking out. Enjoyed the daylight areas of the casino's main lobby area. The nightly volcano watching was enjoyable no matter how many times one saw it. Can't wait to make another trip back.
20,Here on business ended up staying a week splurged for the StayWell. Room was average staff were nice when they were present bathroom is tiny. Literally can't sit on the toilet and shut the door at the same time. StayWell bed was ridiculously hard and the I felt like the HEPA filters just dried everything out further.    Important to note:. Walls are HORRIBLY THIN. Ended up moving mid stay to a normal room after 3 nights with less than 2hrs sleep. Neighbor thought he was a DJ. . . They accommodated but no consideration for my hassle.
50,We love the Mirage everyone is so nice and friendly the Pantry’s coffee and breakfast was the best! We have stayed there several times in the last twenty years. We love the pool and all the amenities! The conservatory is so amazing with the beautiful tigers lions leopards and the entertaining dolphins we well worth the time and price!
50,We love the intimacy of the mirage and the relaxed atmosphere. We keep on coming back again and again and it never disappoints! The pool and dolphin bar are one of the best in Vegas. Zero complaints and would highly recommend this hotel.
10,I stayed here with my now ex the room was in my name all i wanted was for him to be removed and i wanted to go to bed. My ex stold my card so i has no money to book a room somewhere else they did not care threw me out like i was garbage scariest night of my life
30,The room looked nothing like the pictures. Bedding was not fully there missing towel pictures missing off wall shower had holes in the wall. Digital key stopped working after 1 day. I was rushed for check out after I had requested late checkout
50,The Mirage is located on the perfect place on the Vegas strip. And it had some of the best dining and entertainment around. Lots of things to do and see and the best pool we have been to in Vegas. Casino layout was very easy to navigate and easy to get to from the hotel elevators.
50,Nice time to visit. Pleasant at night not too hot. Hotel is awesome clean everywhere you see workers cleaning waterCoke’sbeers expensive easy Uber or taxi pickup easy checking in and out  great time there.
50,We were concerned as there was a festivals in town with over 50000 attending. Directions brought us right to the hotel signs clearly guided us to the self parking area. Finding parking entrance can be very stressful on the main strip. We were very early but found lots to do while we waited Lunch shopping getting lay of the main floor. Room was clean modern and the view was breathtaking. Had a blast!
50,Awesome experience overall. The front desk was extremely understaffed and slowed down both check in and check out. The gaming experience was great along with all of the other amenities. Loved how closed it seemed to be to everything!
40,We stayed here for the first time I originally wanted to stay here because they put on the fire show in front of the hotel and our kids love it. The pool was nice I just wasn’t expecting it to be cold and it was we were all shivering but still had a good time. We will definitely be coming back!
50,This was my first visit back to Las Vegas in nearly 20 years. I remember The Mirage as a must see attraction then and was amazed at the interior so I was very happy that this was where we were going to be staying for the convention. Nothing disappointed. There was a long lineup for check in but the staff moved people along very quickly. Location is great the room was very comfortable and I only wish I had had time to enjoy the pool area.
40,Good central strip location. Gaming floor OK. Pool is beautiful with ample lounges two coffee shops and a few restaurants. Rooms are clean and nicely appointed  No refrigerators which is so today instead a mini bar which I cannot imagine gets used much by the average person. Staff was great
40,Skip the Aces of Comedy show with Nikki Glasser she was HORRIBLE. Even her opening acts were terrible. We left her show early as did many others. Even the Mirage staff agreed she was horrible - and wondered why they kept having her back. We’ve seen Ron White and Jay Leno here - and they were great.    We were 2 couples sharing a 2 BR suite for 1 week - which was great. Check-in and housekeeping were very good. Concierge (Amanuel) was great! Rooms and bed were very clean and comfortable. Love that this hotel is at the center of the strip and not too huge. Good clientele (no homeless or crackheads that you see in some Vegas hotels now). Security was very good. Private pool with reserved chairs and cabanas were great as was the service (Dana and Chelsea). Bellhops are fab.    Good blackjack tables. Extremely disappointed in the slots - rare penny and no nickel machines. None of the slots would allow you to win. The rare penny machines had minimum bets of 75 cents. Come on Mirage! Happy wives playing slots will allow the husbands to play blackjack longer! Good drink service in the casino.    Good bars with great live music. Bring back the BLT burger restaurant (many others told us the same). The new Mexican restaurant Diablos was barely ok margarita was terrible. CPK was great as was the new sandwich shop/deli.    Would like improved Mlife info/services - we didn’t get credit for all our gambling/expenditures - and the cards wouldn’t work most of the time at the slots.    Would have given the Mirage 5 stars - except for the horrible Nikki Glasser show and the poor slots.
40,Bathrooms are small. Lots of noise in room from hallway. Requested volcano view but atrium blocked my view.    Delicious food. Nice pool. Comfy bed. Hotel/casino easy to navigate. Good location on strip.
50,I Liked the shows was greate and all food and shops are greate pool was may favorite I did like the service at pool and really clean and very clean The Volcana Show Was Incredible I hope I can have a better view next time
10,Me and my girlfriend were asked to leave the hotel on a Friday night for being too loud. We were not refunded any money for the remaining three nights we booked. The security person that came to our room treated my girlfriend extremely rudely and caused more problems than he solved. I will never stay at the Mirage again.
40,We enjoyed our stay. The hotel and casino were both clean and pleasant. We really liked the location of the hotel it was within proximity of everything we wanted to see. We also appreciated the digital check in experience and would highly recommend using it vs sitting in the front desk line.
50,I really enjoyed this hotel. The view was amazing the food and drinks were great and the hotel staff were amazing as well. We stayed in the King city view and had a very nice view of the dolphins pool and the city.
50,We loved the Mirage and stayed Sept 1-10. The tropical theme felt and smelled like vacation. This was our first time staying here and were so incredibly pleased. The staff were all so friendly they truly enjoyed speaking with guests. VIP staff were so accommodating especially Diana. There was an incident after we checked in and a mix up with our room which she quickly fixed. Very personable and fast at her job. The suite was older but very clean. They had a great variety of slots and tables. I wish they had more $25 BJ 3/2 earlier in the day. It was hard to find those tables for a few days. We ate at Snacks Costa Diablo Cantina - all were amazing. The gorgeous pool was busy but so big that you’re spaced enough apart in the water. Oasis pool was fabulous and so much fun. I’ll always reserve seats there. Our host W.H. was always there for any needs he was great! Fabulous hotel/casino staff amenities food security always present fast elevators great bars. We will definitely be back very soon.
10,We were excited to be visiting Las Vegas but the trip soon was overcome with a dark cloud starting at the VIP check-in area at the Mirage Hotel. The service personnel were rude and not accommodating to a simple request. One would think that in these days of having limited visitors the reception area personnel would be kind and nice. Once we were finally in a room it only got worse with a thermostat that would not stop blowing hot air lack of basic amenities in the bathroom etc. It was so bad that we missed the Shin Lin show just dealing with the staff to get the room straightened out. Complaints were not addressed and in fact the reception area hung up on us on two separate occasions.  When I travel I want a relaxing experience and going to the Mirage in Las Vegas was anything but relaxing. Save time and go elsewhere Wynn Venetian Bellagio all will value your money more!
50,The Mirage is still a great resort amid some of the newer larger hotels. Best spot on the strip not to far from anything else you want to see. The Volcano and pool area are still really nice. No coffee in the rooms so be prepared to go down and buy Starbucks available at two locations on the first level.
50,Good service  great gambling. No bs. Check in and check out easy and fast . Easy to find tables and games . It was my sons bachelor party . We all had good fun and it was a great staff. I recommend the weekends when the place is jumping and easy walking access to best spots on the strip
40,Great location clean room and a very nice hotel with the signature “Mirage smell”. Expensive resort fees and this year you will also have to pay for self parking which is very unfortunate. It’s an aging hotel but has been well maintained. The only negative regarding the room is the tub/shower combination. Most expensive resorts have a standalone shower. At least the water pressure was pretty amazing.
40,Great customer service amazing location and good sized pool. However rooms had chipped paint old couches loose fixtures one of the lights didn’t work in our room. My basic suite was very dusty and with a wipe could see dark grey from wiping the counters my parents were in a larger suite and it was very clean.
30,The website mentioned that the room had a mini fridge & that parking was free. The mini fridge was not to used by occupant because it had only things to purchase & the parking was for only 1 hour otherwise it was $15 a day.
50,The rooms were clean. The staff was friendly and welcoming. We ate at three of the restaurants in the hotel the food was great at all three. The snack place had huge portions a breakfast sandwich easily fed two. Covid restrictions were in place and inforced.
10,Super bad check in service. Waste of time the host didn’t even look at you or ask if you needed something. Acted super racist as well. I will never be coming here again. Don’t waste your time at all here
20,Terrible customer service. Rooms look really old with cigarette and weed smell coming from the A/C. Rooms look old. Bathroom shower floor looks yellow and the floor is tearing apart. Every single towel is old and ripping apart.
40,Never judge a book by its cover. Be hospitable at all times. Most travelers now read reviews. I was okay with ignoring and disregarding Mlife benefits but I needed a wheelchair and the host should have made it his business that I stayed at the desk while he called or gathered another employee to get security for a wheelchair. If there was an irate customer I am sure there was a way to call security.
10,Found Bed bug in room. Hotel said they would only do something about it if they found evidence when I clearly showed a pic with date & time to prove it was there! AND I left it in the toilet. Hotel overall was dirty. Would not recommend for price. Location was great but so not worth it!!!!
50,I really enjoyed the safety features of this hotel. This Made my stay worthwhile. Very gracious great food very enjoyable. Props to all the staff! I will definitely stay at this Hotel again and tell my friends about it!
50,Had a week visit for work and the stay was great the hotel is very clean the staff is very friendly the food at the Pantry was delicious and there are plenty of options for activities found through out!
40,"Was a good centralized conference arena for post educational experiences.Staff was lovely and helpful AND responsive to requests.Just TOO DAMN COLD!  Bed was wonderfully convertible but ""neighbors"" were obviously a group of young women intent in gossiping and partying."
50,Great location easily walkable to Bellagio Caesar’s and more. The pool is fantastic very tropical. Rooms are adequate restaurants are limited but ok. Somewhat limited open tables and quick to bump limits.
20,Very disappointed my first and will be last stay at Mirage hotel room. Checked-in Friday for weekend stay my room was on the fourth floor standard guest room. Soon as I walked into room it had a terrible moldy and dank smell. The interior and furniture looked out-dated and 80’s decor. Room was dark and bathroom lighting and fan noise was poor quality.    The room stunk! Literally it smelled.  I will not be staying and will not tell recommend.
30,location and pool were amazing staff was incredibly helpful. my advice when you get there is have them double check the cleaniness of your room and make sure all drains drain and faucets/shower work. other than that i would recommend.
50,The best experience me and my wife ever had.lot of hangout lot of drinking and dancing. Enjoyed all the different places and the night out in town. Will be back again if not for our anniversary for reason crazy reason I can make up. Lol
30,We enjoyed our stay there was nothing that was over the top amazing but it was decent. We traveled for work and it was slightly inconvenient that the remainder of the room was due at check in and had to be put on my personal debit card instead of the card that we booked the room with which was the company credit card. I also feel for the price of the room the bathroom could have been updated the shower head sprayed in every direction and was so old it couldn't be moved to and there should be a fridge in the room. I understand it's Vegas and they want your money it would have just been nice to keep our drinks cold in our room.
50,Derrick was excellent at the front desk . Housekeeping staff was very nice and accommodating. Love the food and the casino  left a sweater at one of the slot machines was able to retrieve from security next day . Awesome Trip!
50,"From the moment we arrived till the moment we left the staff in all departments was friendly helpful and knowledgable. The room was very nice and we got to see Cirque du Soleil's ""Love"" an amazing show on the premises. We will return to the Mirage!"
10,Very disappointed in room quality especially after paying extra for the ‘Stay Well’ room. Questioned when requesting more towels from housekeeping. Overall not a good experience and not wanting to return to this establishment.
20,Our king StayWell room was musty smelled of smoke and strong mildew. Complained. Front desk offered a wheelchair accessible room or stay in assigned room and next day they would deodorize. Not acceptable.
50,All the staff members were very nice and personable. The casino was paying out but all in all the place was great to stay at. We’d stay here again as the rooms were very clean. Thank you Mirage for making our stay a nice one.
50,This was my 1st trip to Las Vegas and the mirage was in the perfect location.The room was very clean and above expectations.we stayed for 3 days and every area of the hotel was clean.the pool was very nice also
40,Went to Vegas with a big group we all stayed at the Mirage. Easy to get together for meals hang at the pool and gamble. Great food at The Pantry the Snack Shop and Diablos Cantina. Staff was friendly and helpful. A few cute bar areas to sit and drink when you are done gambling.
50,All staff was very polite and professional they provided excellent service. Room was very spacious and clean. Check-in was easy and the room was ready right at 3:00 pm. Check out was quick and bell hop service was provided for free.
50,This was our eighth stay at the Mirage. The pool is great and the staff is so attentive. The bathrooms could use a facelift but the location is perfect. Hopefully next year will yield the same results.
50,"Have vacationed in Vegas several dozen times usually staying in Ceasar properties. This time I got a fantastic comp offer after staying in the Belagio in 2019. Loved everything about Mirage - rooms updated fresh great storage and perfect size. Location on the Strip was ideal - also loved way guest rooms are not ""miles"" to the entrance. The pool experience was fabulous!! Will definitely return - I'm now a MLifer for good."
40,My only complaint is that the mgm properties don’t give out changewhen you cash you slot tickets in.you have to take them to a cashierwhich sometimes the lines are long. I seems like they want you to leave the loose change behind
40,Easy and convenient check in/out via MGM mobile app including parking fee. Clean Comfortable accommodations. Guest floor access with room key made us feel secure. We enjoyed our stay and look forward to our next trip!
30,It's impossible to Win at your Casino's table games! I personally saw so many players loose like I did. A fair chance to win should be the fair play rules. You guys are worse than pickpockets. After a $1000 loss the Host permits 10% only for any comps??
50,"I don't think it's possible to have a bad meal at the Mirage- and for so long now the staff has always been just so darned nice. And The Beatles ""Love"" is a treasure that must be kept there forever. I don't think I want to stay anywhere else in Las Vegas!"
50,I stayed here with my daughters we had a great time ! We seen the Beatles love show it was a must! The rooms are clean they have a nice pool we enjoyed and the dolphin habit right next to the pool. Family friendly place
50,Very awesome experience. Everyone was super friendly and very helpful. Rooms were great and very clean. Also there are really good places to eat inside the resort. Didn’t seem short handed at all plenty of table games open and drink service was great.
50,Definitely coming back. Staffs are very nice . Pool are ok We tried few places but we like the mirage the most. Clean nice and middle of the strip. Breakfast at pantry is very good love breakfast potatoes there.
50,The Maroge is one of the nicest hotels on the strip. I really enjoyed the cab service and the young man who helps you in front of the location. Even though I didn’t ride the tram it was great to know that we had transportation choices. The concierge was very helpful and helping us navigate the shows we were interested in attending. Our room was very comfortable. There was not a lot of noise of our floor. The overall stay was awesome I will definitely use this hotel again. Thank you for your hospitality at the Mirage!
10,They showed up three days after leaving. The hotel is beautiful and we loved the pool but the room was a little grungy and I wouldn’t go back there again after this experience. They were in our suitcases and clothing.
50,Location was convenient and easy to get to the Convention Center. The room was comfortable & clean upon check-in. Food and drink prices are high. I've stayed at Mirage several times and enjoyed the comfort of the casino and dining choices. Overall experience was excellent and staff are always friendly and welcoming.
40,The hotel was great the staff was nice to a point of arrival and leaving. Everything helped me get away from work and stress. Will be back again just not sure when. Wish i had little bit more help with my issues but overall great time.
20,better bedding at a motel 6 rooms were never cleaned towels not changed staff did not bring any excitement to the tables when I said something they clearly blew me off said it woild be taken care of but nothing happened I just went out
10,Fully stocked mini fridge super sensitive something move your charges. Told we couldn’t store anything in it not for personal use. And staff assumed we couldn’t afford to rent one they offered. They had no coffee maker no microwaves (no required but nice to offer)
20,The air conditiinera in the rooms are full of mold. Most everyone could smell the musty moldy smell and many of my co-workers got physically ill. Hopefully by the time you read this review the hotel will have already taken care of the problem. Until then I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.
40,Great time of football and gaming  Arrived on a Sunday and place was hopping  The Still forced a $50 per person to eat there. That’s was bullcrap  Loved the casino great location would come again  Lots of action all day and night
40,Average on most aspects. Machines tables and concepts were honestly typical. Everyone done their job and it was the same with mentality in ways. When you spend several days at a hotel you expect it to be some what like home. With that said taking out trash and wiping things down for cleanliness goes a LONG way in my opinion. With all the competition there something different goes a long way for customer happiness and new business. Also there were two trade shows in town one I attended. There wasn’t a single advertisement of it going on or any company that has representation staying there.
30,WiFi in the room was awful. No outlets by the beds. 10 minutes on hold with the desk to get a refrigerator. Wallpaper falling off walls. AC was great. Water was hot. Location on the strip is great. Pool was nice. Waitstaff was great!
50,Things I loved about my stay:  Easy online check-in  Friendly staff  Nice room (except shower head was broken)  The view of the volcano from my room  Great Resturaunts  The blackjack tables  The bar in the center of the casino
40,Overall a good stay beds were a little uncomfortable but other than that a great stay. Staff was very friendly and room was very clean at check in. Check in process was smooth and very nice. Pool is amazing
50,Highly recommend The Mirage! Our room was very clean had great amenities and was spacious. The view was spectacular as was the pool and casino. Parking was easy and convenient. We will definitely be staying here on future trips to Vegas!
40,There was no mini fridge in the room so that was very inconvenient. The shower head was worn out and out dated plus the water pressure was very high. The beds are very comfortable but an outlet by the night stand could be very useful.
20,"Came to the Mirage Hotel for a Conference. First room wreaked of mold. Hotel was pretty packed and while appreciative of business paid travel I knew I couldn't stay in that room. I have a mold allergy. Front desk was apologetic and mad immediately moved me to a higher floor with a great view - however the new new room also had a mold smell - even though a lot more faint. I thought it would be OK but ended up waking to severe migraines in both nights. I think the HVAC system generally needs an overhaul. When it looked at the filter for the AC it was FILTHY with obvious spots of discoloration/patches. I don't have a great cell phone camera nut tried to take photos without touching/disturbing the rattles filter. The have ""Stay Well"" rooms apparently with better filtration but I would hope those wouldn't come at the neglect if care and maintenance in the rest of the building. Disappointed. Cant see staying here again. Convenience to conference courses and seeing the pool were the best part but if I am eating th ahe room I can't go any higher."
30,Rooms need upgraded. We had a chair in each room (3 rooms) that had to be from the 90's and was stained (all 3). There is no refrigerator to store leftovers. No coffee maker. No microwave. Everything was just average. Staff and dealers were wonderful. Housekeeping was excellent.
50,The Mirage was great!!!! I enjoyed myself even though it was business trip I still had a great time. The whole experience was wonderful! The people I came across were very polite and friendly. I also liked the idea that all the staff knows to let the guest know to wear their mask if they do not have it on or not on correct.
50,We had a very good experience at the Mirage. The room was comfortable and clean. Staff was very friendly. The casino did not smell smokey when walking through which we were thankful for.  We had breakfast at the pool restaurant which was not crowded and we had excellent food and exceptional service.
50,We took in dinner and a show and enjoyed a quiet stay away fro home. (Henderson). Would definitely book a strip view king again for a staycation. The amenities and staffing at the facility was excellent and the room was very comfy
40,Rooms were clean staff was friendly and responsive they respect and thank their veterans. Everyone we talked to was helpful it was easy to get a cab. Plenty of restaurants in the area. Plenty of towels and supplies in the fridge and bathroom
40,All in all it was a refreshing stay we loved it that we were given a room that has the view of the other hotels. The Pantry & Otoro Restaurants was our favorite great service. It was convenient for our stay since we were going for the the magic show: Shin Lim. We enjoyed the show so much!
40,I found the casino floor and pool to be great here at the mirage but the rooms are tiny and dated. They are in need of a refurbishment. I also found their not to be many food options after hours. The nearest late night food is across the street in the Venitian.
50,Just returned from a week and last day realized a crosswalk right near we could have visited to make drinks and meals much cheaper during our stay. Food and drinks are very expensive at pool and inside the casino but am sure it is like that everywhere and in other places.
40,Got my room on a deal room was little worn but still decent was very happy with location front desk service was very helpful and nice wish they gave me the bathrobes that it was advising on it the mirage site was disappointed
30,We were excited to stay at the Mirage. We knew there was a resort fee. What we didn’t know was there was a $200 hold on our debit card for incidentals. Also a $30 fee for valet on the weekends per night.    We booked through a 3rd party and decided we wanted to stay another night. Which we offered to book directly through the hotel but the clerk would not match the online price. So we had to book another night online and have an additional $100 held on our card.    The pool also closes at 7pm which seemed very early for a Friday night.    No fridge in the room. Nothing complimentary.    Expect lots of walking to get to the elevators and your room depending.    The good: the pool was large and not over crowded. The location. The extra activities. But they are extra $$$.    I’d say make parking free and match online pricing and lower your incidental hold.
10,I checked into my room and it didn’t smell clean as the room my sister got down the hallway. As I was going to check out the bathroom I noticed there was BLOOD on the floor and in the sink there was a MENSTRUAL PAD that was used. I was so disgusted.. I called front desk to send up the cleaning crew and he said they’d come immediately. We left for about an hour or two and when we came back the pad was gone but the blood was still on the floor! I had to call two more times just to get it resolved. It was so stressful to get it cleaned correctly. I will never stay here again.
30,The rooms didn’t seem like they were properly cleaned. We saw hair around bath tub and toilet. Room looked outdated with a small 40” tv from 2000. When asked for more bath towels was told there wasn’t any available. The bed and pillow seem worn out. Not as comfortable as they use to be. Love the location on the strip been staying here the last 4 times I’ve visited Vegas. But I think this is my last until they get better.
50,mobile check in is one of the best features of the mirage is so efficient and so easy  we avoid all the long lines and its so easy to use will definetly be back soon to the mirage.. great job mirage!!!
10,Expo. Services were not priority. People have attitudes flagrant disrespectful and don’t follow through on anything they promise or say they will do. When we arrived early we sat foe over an hour at aprx 3am. We were told you were booked. I had to go to Trump Towers to get a room.
30,The room was just Ok. I was not happy with the lack of amenities in the room like no coffee and a 50.00 fee to put something in the fridge if you needed to keep room service from spoiling. 40.00 a day to use the fitness center seems extremely high as well.
40,The room was clean. There is some wear and tear but the room was good. The bed was very comfortable. The only negative is no coffee maker in the room and no refrigerator. Note:. We were on the 14th floor overlooking the strip and the nightly eruption of the volcano. The eruption was pretty cool! But about the second day I realized the elevator didn't go to the 13th floor. So in reality we were staying on the 13th floor. For superstitious gamblers that might be a negative also.
50,Great place to stay great dining wonderful pool friendly staff terrific location on Las Vegas strip. Lots to do on property and in the surrounding area. A variety of dining options from quick sandwich options to high quality steak and seafood options. Tiger and dolphin experiences on property.
50,Great location staff was very friendly and numerous restaurants & bars to choose between. Checking in using the self check in kiosk was fast and easy to use overall the Mirage is a great place to stay.
20,The toilet leaked when flushed and bathtub stopper would not drain when taking a shower...they moved us to a new room but the A/C would not get cool enough in the new room...no issues with the staff - they were friendly and compensated for the inconvenience...Rooms are outdated...bathroom is small...for the price you could do a lot better somewhere else...
30,"Not bad. Vegas is ridiculously expensive for food drink and entertainment now. Pit bosses no longer even bother rating you if you play less than 3-4 hour blocks and bet less than $30/hand. No freebee dinners or comped rooms now because everything is M-life and ""Point totals"" and it's across all of the MGM properties. I guess I miss the Vegas from the early 2000's."
30,21st birthday party for daughter ton of money spent at the casino/hotel/pool/restaurants/room service. Our group was just there in June and did the same. Couldn’t upgrade no cabana availability. Never spoke to a host. Most of our room outlets didn’t work. Other casino hosts contact me regularly but I am always loyal to Mirage. Can’t say that will hold true for the future. Very disappointed with this trip.
20,Other than being over charged for my room the room was great maid service was great the view in the room was bad and check out was great. The young lady was knowledgeable friendly and polite. Good in the room was OVERPRICED UNBELIEVABLE
30,Rooms are dated and lack of free amenities for a 4 star hotel. Called the front desk daily to dispute erroneous charges to our bill. One ice machine per floor always out. No coffee maker or fridge to use for personal use. Ten dollars every morning for two coffees have had better value at a lower star hotels. This does not live up to it's 4 star reputation.
40,The room was decorated nicely and clean but need to be dusted: the lamps. I had a bathroom that was renovated. The carpets needed to be cleaned and the room had a musky smell to it so I aired it out.
50,The workers are very friendly. The location of this hotel is great. Close to everything walking distance. The rooms are very specious and clean. The beds are very comfortable! You feel in the clods. Love the top less pool.
50,The stay at the mirage was excellent.I will definitely stay at the Mirage on my next trip to Vegas. A nice touch was that the rooms were cleaned daily.  The checkin staff were quick and efficient in getting you checked in a unexpected surprise was that even though I checked in early my room was ready.
20,The room I had was sterile and as bland as can be. I wasn't expecting much and I didn't get much. Panels in the wall were loose and open the toilet and shower pressure were so high they both sprayed all over the bathroom when used (grooooooss) towels smelled weird and the electronic keycard malfunctioned in the elevator. The pool is very nice though.
50,Although one of the older resorts on the strip it is also one of the most beautiful and relaxing in all the right ways. The pool area is absolutely awesome! The casino floor has a nice layout with a good mix of table games and machines.
10,Paid almost $2000 for our stay me and my family were excited and ready to have fun One of the bathrooms Did not work properly nor did I reach our standard for the price we paid sink and bathtub did not drain also the showerhead did not work so we had to shower with the bottom portion of the tub like children and when we called the Front desk for assistance the response time was also horrible did not show up until the next day.
40,First time in Las Vegas nice place to stay. I stayed because the show I was there to see was there. Nice not having to go from casino to casino. It was nice that it was so close to so many things on the strip.
50,The mirage was a wonderful stay. Close proximity to everything on the strip. Pool was great. Great service from every staff member. Room was comfortable and clean. We had a great time during our stay here!
40,For the price paid we were disappointed to find the pool closes at 6 pm daily. Many other hotels on the strip w nicer pools that stay open much later. Restaurant selection is small compared to other hotels. Show there is extraordinary.
10,Rooms were very dirty and smelled like mildew. Bathtub was leaking water was all over the bathroom my keys kept giving me issues had to call security to come open the door at almost 2:00 am overall it was a horrible experience!!!
10,I was shocked at how dirty our room was especially during a pandemic. Gross. The walls were also paper thin. It was so loud. You could hear people talking in the hall all night. People getting ice all night. A phone ringing non stop in the next room and a toilet flushing every five minutes in the other. Would not recommend the Mirage at all. Only dined at one restaurant and staff was incredibly rude. Food was cold and one item was missing from order. There’s so many better options to stay. Many are even priced less.
10,I guess if you like blood on the sheets and $25 mixed drinks this is the place for you. Nice pool are and pool bar areas but spoiled by the feeling of ebing completly screwed.This has got to be 200 charachters... so ok how gross is it to have blood ont he sheets? Nasty. And the shower curtain hanger had what amounted to a razor blade screw on the end so when you close it it punctures your finger...and the showerhead leaked and when you tried to turn it so it didnt spray everywhere it would unscrfew the pipe. And the temperature on off knob was loose. oh and no microwave or fridge unless you count the booze fridge with no room for anything. Now is it 200?
40,Mini bar no prices shown for products you take. Must go on TV to get the prices plus overpriced merchandise. $18 bollars for a bottle of water is highway robbery if the price was shown so you could read it from a list on the bar I wouldn’t of bought it but got stuck with it.
50,Loved every minute. Will be back again for sure! Stayed right on the strip and saw the volcano show. Did a little research on the Secret Garden to check on how well they treat the animals and was very impressed! Really enjoyed the Gardens and the dolphin training show. Every time we gambled here we got drinks.
50,This was a perfect stay for the family. There are plenty of things to do for all ages and it’s right in the heart of the strip. The waterfall pool dolphin habitat Beatles show and volcano show was awesome! The restaurants here were also pretty great... the Heritage Steak was magnificent!    On top of all that the customer service was superb!
30,Resort was beautiful . But service with the valet was horrible . Came to celebrate my husbands 30th birthday but I kept getting charged repeatedly and wasn’t I formed what the charges were for. & graveyard agent had told me he can do a complimentary check out at 12:00 then literally 5 min later after coming back from the back office he says never mind he can’t because there is none available . I told him why is that ? He said because there all sold out the next day which was a lie because there was still so much rooms available the next day. When you tell a guest you’ll give them a check out time you’re supppse to honor it but he didn’t . So that was very upsetting. But overall the room was beautiful  and housekeeping was exceptional. She was very sweet. I forgot her name but she deserves a gold star!
50,Hotel is great and clean. The rooms are great always clean and easy to call housekeeping for anything. The pool is wonderful. Lots of places to eat and gamble. The app is great for checking in and out no lines. And easy to make keys with kiosk.
10,Rude staff. Smelly rooms. Security didn’t know where anything was. Masks were not enforced. The parking garage had homeless people in it. The valet was $30 a night and didn’t accept cash. The check in staff was rude. Nobody smiles! Nobody said “welcome!”  “thank you” “please” or had any manners.
50,Love that's it's close to sooo much stuff. CLEAN! FRIENDLY! Felt safe. LOVE LOVE LOVE! McD's and Denny's across the street so eating wasn't so exp. Easy to get an uber. Secret Garden was GREAT! Mall at Cesars was AWESOME! Bring you best walking shoes
30,Where to start? The Mirage experience was disappointing. In no particular order there was mold in the shower on the walls there was visible mold growing in the art hanging over the toilet. There was hair on the ceiling of the shower. The window on the outside is dirty with a large bird poop smear and someone’s forehead mark on the inside. The trim is visibly peeling in two of the elevators. I worked the entire week not there for vacation and after standing on the show floor all day it would be nice to sit in a hot tub for 15 minutes and relax - they are closed! But $37 resort fees are charged. One afternoon I did decide to go by the pool after getting to my room at 5pm - there is no book of hotel amenities in the room so you have to go online. Looking it up on my phone I find that the pool is open until 7pm. When I get down to the pool the sign says it closes at 6pm! Hello you can update your website in seconds… but the information is out of date and creates disappointment. One afternoon I went to get ice the machine on my floor would not work… and the key card would not work for other floors on the elevator. The cigarette smoke was the worst - where were the air filters?
50,Check in was a bit long of a wait but casino it’s self is very well managed! You have to try the restaurants. Diablo and Pantry have amazing food and exceptional service! Although everything is a bit pricey but that’s all of Vegas.
30,Located perfectly but room was not too impressive pay for parking even with a room better to spend a bit more to get a nicer room and free parking. Check in is a breeze and very simple. Overall decent but nothing spectacular that you expect from Vegas
50,All the staff that works at The Mirage were amazing very friendly. The Beatles show was awesome. There is something for every age to do. I have absolutely no complaints. Will be staying there from now on.
50,Staff was friendly enjoyed the pool saw Beatles Love stayed on the —Be Well floor 12–slept like a baby on the memory foam mattress—and my favorite part was the spa- a massage and hydra facial! Never had to leave the mirage- we even caught the volcano erupting out front at 9pm
10,Charged $15 per night for parking on top of the resort fee. Additionally charged me for mini bar purchases I didn’t make. Steer clear!! The app was a freaking waste of time too as I still had to wait in line to check in.
30,The beds in the stay well area were very uncomfortable (very hard mattresses) and  Rust in bathroom that made the shower look dirty. When vacationing it’s important to have a comfortable bed and be able to relax it was very disappointing especially for such a beautiful hotel
10,The mirage still tries to act like they are an elite property and.charges as if they are. I would stay at Excalibur over this dump any day. Mold all over bathroom walls that they obviously haven't cleaned in years. Holes in walls. Place needs to be torn down. Nothing impressive about casino or sports book anymore.
50,Totally enjoyed our stay and we love the simplicity of restaurants and coffee shop.  Convenient to elevator. Everyone of the staff were more than accommodating and helpful to our needs. Front desk were friendly and professional.
30,Small outdated rooms but clean. Bill in poker bar was so friendly snd gave good restaurant recommendations. Front desk not accommodating. Food in Japanese not great. Outside of property has trash everywhere. No choices for lunch Open.
10,Staff working on side valet was cussing around children and was extremely rude to registered guest. Completely unprofessional security guard working at 9/11 was extremely rude and single handedly ruined the experience.
50,Every time i stay at the Mirage i have a clean room and the staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are well appointed with comfortable beds. I all ways find good food at the Mirage with plenty of variety and good atmosphere at each venue.
50,Was here w/family and friends for the weekend and we all loved everything about the hotel !!! We will definitely coming back soon their locations is perfecthotel always clean staff very friendly and the pool oh May!!
40,I attended a conference at the Mirage the first week of September. Having never been to a conference in Las Vegas before I was pleased that the conference location was separate from the hotel and casino. The conference rooms were clean spacious and allowed for easy social distancing. I would attend another Conference at the Mirage.
50,Expectations were low while in the state of Covid and the hotel was strict with their mask wearing rule. Other than that my stay was excellent staff and stores and restaurants were very good. No issues !
50,Awesome!! Had never stayed there and really enjoyed everything!! Great location and amenities! Lots of table games and slots to choose from. Pool area was amazing! Was there for five days and highly recommend!!
50,Great hotel that is easily accessible from the interstate. Centrally located on the Strip. Huge pool self-parking only a short walk from lobby and lots of choices for food shopping and that early morning Starbucks on premise...
40,As far as the property and staff goes I was impressed with the overall Mirage experience. I really wanted to give a 5 of 5 review but I kicked it down a notch because of the unacommodating fest staff who actually downgraded my room with a view of the strip to the 5th floor with now view. I reserved 2 rooms and request both on the same floor.
10,Dirty room dirty furniture dirty shower. Voicing a concern resulted in “we can move you in 3 days”. Other couples voiced the same. The good news is if you are a smoker (we are not) you win! Smoke is a constant haze in the casino from 10a on. Like to smoke weed? Apparently it’s a great place for that as well the weed vaped inside was unbelievable. Need a smoke free room you loose. Asking several people the all say the same smokers stench in rooms.
40,I enjoyed it. Did not care for the casino. Would be nice to have better ways to avoid it. The staff was very friendly especially the security. They were very helpful. I really liked how clean the room was. The bed was very comfortable. More outlets would be good. I really likes the lights over the bed nice touch.
40,The hotel is beautiful and the location is perfect for easy walking to many popular attractions. The staff is friendly and professional and the rooms were clean and very spacious. My only negative comment is there was no coffee in the room for the guests and no complimentary coffee in the lobby. Also there are no refrigerators or microwaves in the rooms. These are conveniences that I am accustomed to when travelling.
40,We took our granddaughter to Las Vegas for her birthday. We had a very good experience which included visiting the Dolphins and the animal sanctuary. The hotel was very clean although I thought the prices for most everything were a bit high.
50,Awesome experience despite pandemic. Hotel was very clean and service was fantastic. Front desk was very welcoming and accommodating. I usually stay at the MGM Grand but decided to give The Mirage a shot and I'm very glad I did.
30,Room was dirty bathtub was rusty everything felt dingy. Bartenders were rude. Front desk was rude. Restaurants were unavailable mostly. On the bright side the pool was spectacular the concierge was very helpful prepaid parking was easy and the convention center was very nice.
10,No room coffee dirty rooms fees for EVERYTHING (parking stupid resort fee of $37 plus a $5 tax on it! Want a late checkout? - 2 hours $30 4 hours $50 can’t use their mini fridge as its full of their stuff to buy- but if you put your stuff there they charge you $50 OR they will happily bring you another fridge for $30!). Knock over anything on the snack tray get billed automatically. Casino and main areas are freezing cold.
50,Such a wonderful stay. Best location on the strip. Beautiful views. Casino is amazing with such great service. The pool is so nice with amazing views as well. Room was really clean and we felt right at home.
50,The Conservatory was beautiful with all the exotic plants and the waterfalls ! Very refreshing especially in the midst of a hot summer !  My room was on the 19th floor quiet felt safe comfortable and I slept well. The casino was clean and spacious but need to have more popular slot machines.
20,I really don't like rooms where they have water bottles and candy on weight sensors and you lift them they automatically charge you. For the cost of the room they water and candy should be included. Besides that the bed sheets were soft and the TV was a good size. The room was also quiet except for noise from the hall.
20,For the money stay elsewhere. Hotel is massive but the actual casino is not. Be prepared to walk to get everywhere in the hotel. There is only 1 spot to catch the elevator to the room. So you’ll have a long walk to your room. Then if the digital key doesn’t work be prepared to walk a mile to get a physical key.
50,After a year and a half delay finally able to come back. This was our 3rd stay at The Mirage within the past 3 years. Everyone and everything was excellent. This was the 2nd time we saw Love and it was better than ever. Mirage has the best pool. See you soon.
30,Mirage is a beautiful property But Don’t rely on the digital key get a real one from the desk. The app went down and I was unable to get into my room. Also somebody came down the hallway at 4:13 AM trying all the doors and locks up on the fifth floor that was scary. It is a LONG Walk from the self parking and front desk all the way through the casino to get to the guest elevators so travel light and prepared to lug all that luggage quite a distance.
20,Stayed in the strip facing rooms. Rooms are dated shower pressure poor water never really got hot. Had to call housekeeping a few times to bring towels since they only left one towel after cleaning the first day. It took 2 phone calls and almost 2 hours to get a set of towels so we could shower. They should have a coffee maker in the room or at least let people know that they’re going to charge you a $9.00 delivery fee when you call for a cup of joe.  and the worst part…the hallways reeked of marijuana the 4 nights we stayed there. It smelled like skunk made me sick to my stomach. Staff didn’t care.
50,Really nice place I liked our view and the hotel room. I would recommend to check in on the app to avoid the long line. Getting to our room was a bit difficult sincerely it was our first time but the security guards were able to tell us were to go.
50,I WAS TREATED LIKE A KING AT THE PANTRY(Jannelle)  DiablosCosta  The silver taco truck across from the pantry.  1st TIME I SPEND 80% of my Time indoors at your resort.  THE MIRAGE  See u all next month👍🏼👌🏻👌🏻
30,Front desk gave me the room that was not strip view as promised no towels and the safe was out of order. Had to call and visit the front desk 3 times before they changed my room. Not all Restaurants were open the ones that were open had long lines and did not accept reservations for 1 person no more buffets and the the all day snacks place was closed this morning. Table games were in short supply. The pool and the gym were adequate.
30,We’ve been coming to the Mirage for over 20 years and it is no longer the gem of the strip. Minimal cocktail staff working floor thread bare towels in the room and overpriced food and beverage make it hard to recommend.
40,"We've been staying here for years and really love the location and amenities but are seeing signs of change. For one thing door jam at bathroom needed painting. For the first time we also felt the cost was a tad high for what we got especially the annoying ""resort"" fee when hot tubs were closed and we didn't use the pool. We also noticed a much younger crowd than we've noticed in the past with more crowded game tables and higher minimums. Overall forcthe first-time were consideribg someplace else for next year. We're going to do a little more research and shopping around. We used to be loyal MGM Grand guests until they remodeled thier guest rooms."
20,First and last time at Mirage. Definitely not up to par with other MGM resorts. Room was very dirty and worn. There's extension cords ran under the carpet you trip over. The outlets are so worn nothing will stay plugged in. In room USB ports didn't work. Constant issues with room key app and room keys.
40,"This is an updated review -    After posting the original review below someone from the MGM team reached out to me directly to apologize for any inconveniences. Additionally they assured me that all current property changes are temporary and they refunded my resort fees and food and beverage charges in an effort to show they take value and service seriously. I wanted to post an update to not only show that they're listening but to also take into account the unexpected (but appreciated!) level of service I received after posting the original review. In an effort to be transparent I've included my original review below along with changes I made to the star ratings based on the response.    Star changes:    Overall: 3 -> 4  Value: 3 -> 5  Service: 4 -> 5    Original Review:    The Mirage has been my ""go to"" MGM property for years but I think it might finally be time to move on. To start several food / drink options are gone or have been replaced with something worse. Rhumbar is closed. Cravings is closed. Portofino has been closed for years. Carnegie Deli has been replaced with the far inferior Snacks. The Pantry (long a staple of my late night snacking) closes around 2pm. I don't know if it's the lack of dining options but trying to get lunch at the Pantry means a 30-45 minute wait despite using Osteria for overflow seating.    I used to love playing Pai Gow Poker at the Mirage but they've gone from 2+ tables down to one and the minimum at night and on the weekends is now $50. There's technically a second table near the Cashier but it's never operational.    The MLife desk (which was already painfully slow) has been moved to the Cashier.    The Poker room is permanently closed.    The rooms are starting to show their age and feel very dated. Also I can't remember having this problem in the past but there are literally no outlets near the bed for charging your phone at night.    I was assigned a room on the 2nd floor via mobile check-in and had to stop by the front desk to get something higher. This is the second time in a row I've had to do this.    I used to love the Mirage and maybe it's just due to the pandemic but I was very frustrated with this recent trip. It feels like far too many corners are being cut to save money despite the casino feeling fuller than even pre-pandemic."
50,All in all great hotel and clean. That’s what we expect out of hotels like this. Check in is amazing all from my phone. We thought the staff was very nice and really made the stay pleasant. I will be staying here again.
50,Was great from the rooms to the staff was just a all around great experience they really do a great job of taking care of the people that stay there was a very fun and pleasant experience will definitely stay there again
40,Perfect location and great pool. Rooms need updating and need more servers on casino floor. Overall the hotel is nice just need some updating. With minor improvements this a is a great location to vaction
40,Had a great time. I would go back in a heartbeat 💗 The location was great and I had a great luck with the casino machines I loved the card tables and also the restaurants within the hotel and casino I would go back
40,The landscape and decor of the hotel was serene and beautiful. The best pool I've seen so far. I am not one to go to pools during COVID; but the scenery called me to go out to lounge and have a dole whip. Great service. Rooms are average; bathroom is minimal - I do select hotels based on bathrooms; so this is one of the downfalls to this hotel. Right across the street to everything and very close to Cesars. Perfect locale.
50,Staff were friendly and helpful. Casino and rooms were clean  and comfortable. Plenty of restaurants and entertainment to choose from. Room service/food provided by the Pantry was very good and fast. Will not hesitate to return to the Mirage soon!
10,This was a Horrible trip room stank of MOLD and Mildew  The air condotioner did not work you could see they havent changed the AIR FILTER in the AIR CONDITIONER IN YEARSI DeMAND A REFUNDTHEY OWE ME AND MY WIFE AN APOLOGY AND A REFUND
10,They left a urinated towel on the floorthe trash cans where not cleaned outthe room keys did not work several times. The staff tried to add a $70.00 gratuity to my tab after I paid $50 cash tip they are sneaky be careful worst hotel in las vegas
50,This is our third time to stay here over the course of ten years. We spread our stays at others as well. Friendly staff rooms very clean and pool was great. The rooms could use some updating but overall great experience.
50,The room and hotel location were great! The shower head needs to be updated but otherwise the room is perfect for it's purpose: to sleep. All staff were very friendly and we enjoyed the frozen yogurt restaurant—the acai bowls were loaded with fresh fruit!
50,Amazing stay over all. Me and the misses wanted a day to have fun and last minute we got a room at the mirage. Super friendly staff. Amazing and easy ways to check in and out. Super friendly staff and the food was amazing.
30,Did a 3 night stay there Thurs-Sun I believe it was Labor Day weekend. When we got there I did not want to stand in The check in line so I did the mobile check-in on the M life app they gave us a room assignment so we went straight up to the room. We stayed at a king tower room which I upgraded us from a king resort room to a to a King Tower Room. This room had a view of the airport which my husband did not like so he called the desk and had his change to a room with a better view of the strip. The only difference I found from a King resort room to a king tower room was a bath tub and two sinks instead of one. Very basic no frills for what I was expecting. Furniture was old and worn mattress was hard I could not sleep all night tossing and turning All night. I think I finally fell asleep from exhaustion for a couple of hours. My husband had to call to have the mattress replaced the next morning which they did. After word it was more comfortable the rest of the stay. The mini fridge is locked but that was OK since I brought my own waters and diet soda to drink and a bottle of liquor. There was no ice bucket to get ice so I had to call down to housekeeping for a bucket but they transferred me to reception reception transfer me back to housekeeping finally after 40 minutes somebody came up with the bucket so I can get ice for the room. There was no literature about what amenities or what the hotel offered. My hotel room stay was just OK. I believe it was not worth what we paid. The Maroge has a beautiful swimming pool. Very tropical looking waterfall but you have to rent the cabanas the day beds and even the reclining chairs for a fee if you want to be close to the pool I believe the ones away from the pool The basic reclining chairs are included with your hotel stay. They also have A private adult only section where their own small pool for a fee. Unfortunately the pool area is very crowded I did not have an opportunity to visit it. The Mirage Hotel is a beautiful Polynesian theme hotel with the famous volcanoes in the front and the location is very good in the middle of the strip in walking distance to a lot of the other nice hotels in the area but staying in it is a different story.
50,The Mirage is so familiar to us because it’s the only resort we have stayed at for the past 31 years. Our recent stay was perfect. Never left the property. Every meal was great. The only negative is that the rooms need an update. I’ve said it many times before in recent years. The rooms need to go back to the way they were when Steve Wynn built the property. More of a contemporary colorful tropical look.
50,The Mirage is so warm. They have exceptional staff all the way around. The host Jennifer Lords is amazing. They are always cleaning 24/7. The food is over the top. Great food at the STILL. Have a camper as the kitchen.
40,It’s always been a great property but it has to re invent itself. The rooms need to be completely re done . No tub shower anymore . That is yesteryear. It’s in a great location but it needs a new direction .
50,This hotel is centrally located and most all the other main strip casinos you’d want to visit are walkable. We enjoyed the pool one day. Plenty of chairs and exceptional pool service.    The food options were lacking a little at this hotel in my opinion. They have a Mexican restaurant that seemed to never be open when we were ready to eat. The food options that were open were lined out the door a lot of times. So we found ourselves visiting nearby hotels for almost every meal.
40,We were looking for a family friendly resort on the Strip and ended up choosing Mirage. The pool was great- our 8 yr old loved it. There is no slides or lazy river but it’s laid out like a lagoon and rather special. We went to the Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat (wonderful) and saw the Beatle’s Love Cirque show (unforgettable!). I wish there were more economical food options though. I expect the upscale restaurants to be spendy but $50 for 3 frozen yogurts? Ridiculous.
20,We were shocked that the Mirage does not live up to their expectations. We were disappointed in the facilities. Front desk is slow rooms need some TLC tubs and sink were dirty and did not function as intended. machines need to be cleaned I used my own sanitizer. You get what you pay for.
50,Awesome hotel  the rooms were clean and smell good  the casino soooooooooooo good and the food amazing . The pool was really fun and the cascade great . Thanks so much the mirage for excellent service We’ll come back for sure and great location thanks f course on the center of the strip .💓🥰💓
50,The hotel was lovely and had plenty of things to do and places to eat. I enjoyed the pool hot tub and the wonderful shower water pressure! There were two Starbuck's and the chair massage by the pool was fantastic (although pricey).
50,Had a great experience came for my Son’s 21st Birthday and he enjoyed everything! Plenty to do and convenient location very loose slots! Will be recommending to all my friends and family! Get to packing!
40,If you want a Las Vegas Strip Hotel but not the overwhelming hotel experience like the other larger hotels. THIS IS YOUR PLACE! Great Pool Great Restaurants and absolutely AMAZING STAFF. I will be back soon.
50,Love it here! It’s centrally located and easy to access. I love the restaurant options In the casino as well! Everyone was great and I can’t wait to go back! This is my favorite spot on the strip and will be back soon!
50,one of the best hotel experiences i had in a while. great lobby and games hosted in this hotel. also has it own mini zoo. on top of that if you need some excitement they have a fire show in the front and a pool to cool down in the back.
50,We enjoyed the hotel and all the amenities from casino play and dining to pool and late night snacks. The Sports Book did not disappoint with large couches to get comfortable and enjoy college football
30,The staff were terrific. The 2 shows “Love” & Shin lim was great. Room seemed tired and seen to many winters. The hotel still has her charm. Did have a problem with our shower. It leaked from the light fixture was a “shocking” evening.
50,So first the room got upgraded to a strip view room and everything was just perfect. The room was clean the beds are comfortable and the location is great. Absolutely no complaints whatsoever. Definitely planning on going back!
30,Needs more affordable/mainstream food options. Subway Chic-Fil- A etc. Like a lot of the other resorts. Liked the pool and volcano. Room was clean and comfortable. Location was good. Rental car option was convenient.
50,The room was a good size. Beds Very comfortable. The only thought was I would have liked a walk in shower versus a bathtub shower. The casino was filled with a mix of ages which is nice. Pool was crowded but nice.
50,The room was clean. The pool service was great. Food and drink can be delivered to your beach chairs. Very convenient. Also I got free parking for being a pearl card holder since I'm a Service Member. Pearl cards also gave me food and merchandise discount. Pool water was cold for August. Gym was hard to find I have to ask people and I was pointed to go to the spa. Besides that my stay was relaxing.
50,Very good location along the Las Vegas Strip walking distance to many places. Staff was very friendly. The room was clean and spacious enough for my family. Bed was comfortable. Beautiful hotel. I had a great time
50,The Mirage is a great choice if you want to stay right on the strip. The employees were all friendly and helpful. Rooms were nice and clean though it lacked some amenities that newer hotels have (like plugs by the side of the bed). Parking is $15 a night which is not bad compared to some other casinos. I would definitely stay there again.
50,The Mirage provided the perfect setting for 2 friends to relax and unwind. The pool is the best! Lots of shady spots to relax and enjoy a drink. The location on the strip is great. Absolutely loved Beatles Love!
50,Great time this week at the Mirage. Even though they had to hound you on some of their “temporary “ policies it was a great time. Everyone was very nice there and if we earned enough points we will definitely be back.
50,Very nice atmosphere and stay well room was amazing. In the middle of things to do. Very clean and pool was fun. Came here solo to get away and it was worth staying at mirage and would do it again. Good times
40,Update to review below as of Sept 3: I was contacted within a week of posting this review by Mirage's guest team. The level of service and compassion I received on that phone was stellar. It really sounded like they took my feedback seriously especially about the location of the dog relief area in relation to the guest room elevators and the fact that dogs had to cross the casino floor to get there too. I felt heard and it sounded like they will be making some changes. I do still recommend reading my review below and calling in advance of your stay to see if they have adjusted things. They offered me a refund of the nightly dog fees parking etc. to make up for the experience and it certainly helped offset the feelings I had after our trip. After that kind of response I would stay there again. Sometimes things go wrong and places work to improve--the response I had from guest services is exactly how hotels should address these issues. Would it have been nice if that had occurred upon check out in person? Well yes. BUT we discussed that too and it sounds like they'll be looking into it. Thanks Mirage!    Previous review:  After doing a ton of research to find a hotel in Las Vegas on the strip we were especially concerned with the fact that our dog had to travel with us and whether she would be welcome etc. and how exactly to travel through Vegas safely with her. We were moving across the country and decided to spend two nights in Vegas to see it for the first time. Our plan was for one of us to always stay with her in the hotel room which is why we wanted a central hotel so that we could take turns going out. I cannot deny that it is amazing how the MGM family of hotels allows large dogs without much issue concerning size/weight. That said they do charge $100/night for a dog fee. Their dog policy website looks incredibly welcoming and promises doggie care packages concierge service bathroom space etc. Not only were these items not offered but we were so scarred from our experience that it took me two weeks to muster up a review. Here's the short of it:    -we paid $100/night and did NOT receive any of the promised services. No doggie care package etc.  -They do not warn on the website that you must walk a very far way THROUGH the casino and across the gaming floor in order to reach the hotel elevators. Screaming people flashing machines etc. Needless to say that experience scared our dog so much she did not want to leave the room. I could tell the few other dogs and their owners we saw in there were also incredibly stressed by this and presumably blindsided just like us.  -The doggie bathroom spot especially if your room is far down a hallway took nearly 30 min to get to with our old dog. DO NOT bring an old dog here. It is too far 3-4 times a day. The Mirage needs to warn pet patrons that the dog relief area is no where near the rooms. It's ridiculous where they put it in relation to the rooms. Add that to the distance from the parking garage and well you get the picture.  -Speaking of the parking garage the bridge leads to escalators with no elevator nearby except back over the bridge. No signage indicating escalators only when approaching.  -There are no prices indicated on the bar fridge in the room and no prices on any of the drinks in the Essentials shopping area. Ended up paying $10 for two small bottles of cola after being ripped off by the vending machine on our floor. Twice. That vending machine was broken and after informing the front desk they did not offer to reimburse the money.  -All of the dining options in the hotel are not exactly budget friendly compared to hotels nearby. Expect to spend at least $50 on a meal for two people. We only ate twice a day because of this.  -Digital key access through the app is constantly advertised so that you can check in and use your phone as the elevator and room key. Except apparently it is well known by staff that the phone key function does not work at the elevators. We became trapped IN the elevator with a bunch of luggage and our stressed out dog after braving that casino floor. After 5 tries in complete panic it finally went. However other patrons shared with us that this was not an isolated incident and the front desk issued physical cards afterwards indicated that they know how the digital option does not work often.  -we paid extra for a room with a strip view. They put us near the volcano. So not only does the volcano blow up every hour at night until about midnight or so the view just overlooks the top of the lobby so it actually just looks like overlooking a parking garage. Apparently online it said that the only good strip views are over the pool on the other side. Basically we just looked at concrete with a slight strip view that hardly justified the price. And we had to listen to the volcano blowing up every hour which lost it's allure after the second time.  -they sent two surveys that simply expired after our stay. Why? We just moved and honestly I couldn't even face writing this without feeling triggered from the experience until now.  -Mostly just never ever ever bring an older dog there because of the room to bathroom distance situation. It was an absolute nightmare and it ruined our stay. After telling the front desk about all of these issues at check out I received some apologies but no offer to refund at least the dog fees which I believe should have been reimbursed. It took our dog over two days to recover after that and nearly ruined our cross country travel.    While we appreciate the attempt at dog friendly accommodations the website is extremely misleading and should be much more informative about the situation one will encounter. They may allow dogs but being dog friendly is simply inaccurate.
20,Horrible experience the rooms were filthy and the check in was horrible you have to pay for parking even though your staying in the hotel which is ridiculous the only thing good about the whole trip was the pool and location of the mirage
40,The mirage is centrally located to everything. It was very clean and you were greeted making sure you were wearing a mask and there were sanitizing stations all around the casino. There were also masks next to the sanitizing stations. We felt very safe staying there.
50,We love this resort. Great service food and pool. The pool is like an oasis. Rooms are beautiful. We saw the LOVE show twice this stay. We now have seen 19 times since they opened in 2006. A must see for all ages. Diablo is a great restaurant and the Heritage Steakhouse service was unbelievable.
40,Had a nice stay  Nice property - even if 37 years old  Nice clean room  needs a 24 hour coffee shop  Nice pool  Biggest grip was parking - only 5 handycap parking spaces in self parking  No need to change for parking  $15.00 a day for self parking and $30.00 for valet each use
40,Overall this is great place to stay. Friendly small clean affordable. Staff was very professional and courteous. The only complaint we had was there is very very few options for dining after 6pm. And if you want that after dinner sweet snack…forget it
10,After years of staying at The Mirage… Our advice is to go across the street  and Book a room at Venetian!!! At least you will get a Clean Room and something for your Money!! Venetian has been looked after and Updated! The Mirage Cabanas are overpriced during the Summer and not Clean! Unacceptable considering Covid! Limited Amenities for the Money! Pool Staff makes up for the Old Cabanas!  Unacceptable Hotel Condition for a 4 Diamond Property!
20,I paid top rate for 2 rooms and reveived very tired worn out accomdations. I even paid extra for Strip View Rooms and never got it. Additionally requested high floor and they gave me one of the lowest Floor 3. I am a valued M-Life Member and disappointed with the room and worn out bathroom fixtures.
40,Room was comfortable. It was saddening that we didn’t have an ice bucket or microwave. Accommodations were great. Overall it wasn’t a bad time. Front desk Milly was amazing! I absolutely loved her service
40,Nice casino and average rooms.  Had to change initial room due to various problems.  Second room only slightly better.  Hotel tried to maintain corvid guidelines.  Shuttle to other hotels not working...no valid reason why it wasn't.
50,Matt and Olivia are always accommodating. Feels like home staying at the Mirage. I always looks forward to returning like I will on Sept 9th. I will be bringing my friends and family. we are looking forward to the pool casino and football.    Thank you
40,the mirage is a slightly outdated yes compared to the newer hotels in vegas. however i found it to be a good place to stay with incredibly nightly rates. the room was clean and nice. the in room food delivery was good! the pool area was relaxing with amazing service. over all very good!
10,Frequent the resort when in town and usually have a great experience. This time was overcharged for some F&B during a cabana rental. Front office took off charges upon check out which was agreed upon creating a return customer. Later to find out I was mysteriously charged 1 week after check out for more charges that were agreed upon reversed while not given any notice of the charge.
50,Love this place! Easy to navigate and hands down the best pool in Vegas. The Staywell rooms are awesome (air purifier; perfect bed for relaxing and sleep). Join the mLife players club for perks and special deals via email. Not to miss: The volcano that erupts in front of the hotel (at 8 9 and 10 pm during our stay).
40,I loved the Mirage. The Pina Colata smell was amazing. I won at video poker I won at blackjack and the pool was just perfect. I have been coming to the Mirage for many years (since 1987). The only downside is the resort fees. Every hotel is doing this so I am used to it. You are walking distance to everything you may want to do
20,The rooms were cleaned up and large. We had 4 people in a double queen room and easily could’ve fit a cot for a 5th person. The carpet was stained and disgusting. There was no going barefoot. Bathroom was fine but tiny. Was also disgusted by cigarette butts all over the floor outside the elevators on our nonsmoking floor. Pool was large but very crowded.
30,Staff was friendly and courteous! Rooms need to be updated and Bathrooms are to small and drains are rusted. Great strip location and overall hotel smells good and restaurants are good. Pool is nice. !
10,Very disappointing stay at the mirage. When arriving at the room its was dirty carpet curtains were torn and a used band aide was left by the mini fridge. On second day when house keeping arrived she only left 2 towels and no wash rags. Band aide still remained after notifying her of it.
10,Sewer odor in room coming from commode upon check in. It was never addressed and we were extremely disappointed. We called maintenance housekeeping and the front desk. Our concerns were not addressed for the 6 days we stayed.
50,I enjoyed my stay. I loved my room. The staff were nice. The elevator tricked me a few times but I finally got used to it. The location was perfect and I didn’t have any issues. The pool area is gorgeous. I enjoyed just sitting at the pool with my drink in hand. I would certainly recommend and I will be back for sure.
50,Surprisingly for a 30 year old hotel it was quite modern -- well maintained. Stayed in a StayWell room on the 12th floor. Just high enough to get a great view of the Strip and low enough that it only a short ride up or down. Would definitely recommend.
50,The hotel is very beautiful. The room are really nice. The help is very helpful and friendly. It’s within walking distance to the shopping center. I recommend this hotel to all of my friends and family.
40,I've always been happy staying at the MGM but this time I thought I would try the Mirage. I really enjoyed my stay. The super convenient location the pool the layout of the casino and the helpful staff all made for an enjoyable trip. My room met my expectations although the bathroom was rather small.
50,My wife and I enjoyed our stay at The Mirage. The pool scene has a great vibe. The restaurants were fabulous. When we come back we will stay at The Mirage for sure. The employees were all so nice and helpful
50,Love the Mirage. This has been our home away from home for several years and everyone has always been very helpful and accommodating. Although this is an older hotel the environment has been updated and well kept. The pool is amazing!
40,This hotel was Built-in 1989 beautiful hotel. It's a beautiful hotel but the room's definitely need an update. it's at the perfect spot on the strip the pool is fabulous !! But again the rooms need some help. Casino great only problem the rooms.
50,The hotel check in and out was extremely fast. The rooms we had two different kinds were both clean and sanitized. Everyone was smiling and kind trying their best to help anyone at any time. Definitely will be returning
50,Location at center strip makes it easy to visit nearby facilities. Restaurants are excellent with great food! Facility is always clean and bright. I got the dolphin meet and greet package for my 2 daughters and they absolutely loved every minute.
50,We had a Great time and stay at the Mirage. The Pool is the best. The service was also great. Our room had the best of all worlds strip pool and dolphins. It was a prefect location on the strip. I already booked for next year.
50,I’ve stayed at The Mirage a number of times. They’re my go to resort on the strip based on location and amenities. Rooms are always nice with a good view. The pool is one of the best pools in Vegas! Just can’t beat the property!
50,Will only stay at mirage nowhere else!!!! The best restaurants service pool casino out of all of the hotels on the strip! And it is in the best location on the strip. I never stay at any other hotel. Mirage for life!!!
50,My wife and I had to reschedule this stay due to a venue date change. The entire staff at the Mirage knew our names and that we were celebrating our 20 year anniversary. From thank you cards free dessert from the restaurants to flowers balloons chocolate covered strawberries in our room to even Bruno Mars T-shirts for the concert! The staff and the concierge were amazing. Thanks Chef Brian!
50,First time staying at The Mirage and it definitely won’t be the last. We enjoyed the pool area and the friendly staff. The variety of restaurants is impressive and it’s proximity to the other nicer hotels was convenient.
20,I've been coming to this resort since the 90s but unfortunately this will be my last stay here. They have not made any renovations and the rooms and the pool area are showing there age. We so looked forward to top notch drinks by the pool and instead we received watered down daiquiri that were filled with sugar for $24 a drink. Until they take the time to refurbish this hotel I would not recommend going back
10,Honestly I’ve had nothing but a terrible time in this casino.  I was majorly insulted by one of the floor managers for assuming I was using a card that was declined with the card I booked my room with. Who then told me to find a phone book to find a chase atm. Funny enough it worked just fine next door at Caesars!  I was given $100 food and drink voucher in the form of a $25 coupon for 4 people with resort fees removed. I said thank you.  CPK practically held me hostage and I missed half my concert at Caesars palace I payed a lot of money for my ticket and missed a bunch of the show because they questioned the validity of it if the $25 amount and it was written for 4 people yet I was told it would be fine using it alone.  When I complained about that after my concert someone said they would add another $50 credit for the inconvenience and would cover my breakfast and drinks in the morning  I did that in the morning they looked up my room and they said they had no record of any credit being on my room then delivered me a very cold gross breakfast.  Also I almost got stuck in your elevators with exposed vents/wires. Nothing about my stay was professional.
40,I really enjoyed my stay the outside volcano was wonderful infront of the hotel.The casino area was lovely.I had everything I needed inside of the hotel.I will be back real soon to visit.I had a wonderful time.
50,I like the hotel staff and everything that is connected with service. The administration especially Hussam is doing his best for my comfortable stay.if you want to have a family rest it is the best choice.  I would recommend to stay there if you are going to Hammamet.
50,Great experience through and through. Staff went above and beyond experience was fantastic. Convenient location clean rooms superior service and a smooth experience. Despite a convention staffing created an experience that was simple without waiting forever for food drinks and gambling.
50,We've been staying at The Mirage consistently for about 9 years now and the service and accomodations are always great. While some of the newer hotels may be 'fancier' we find that The Mirage and its clientele fits us nicely. It combines upscale with casual.. so unless you're looking for only upscale and stuffy you'll be happy here.
10,Couldn’t give us the room we requested over a month ago. Serviceability of the elevators is questionable. No room in the fridge for the guests food or drink full of junk for sale. No coffee maker in room. Poor checkin and checkout procedures.
40,The staff was excellent! Any concerns/questions that I had they all were very helpful. Even the guest that shared the same elevator as us were all so nice! The room was average nothing special. We did have a couple of minor issues but everything was taken care of right away. The self check-in is the way to go.
30,Room was okay. Couldn’t open the refrigerator. Half the restaurants are closed. Slots are nothing special. Ice machine is just one per floor. View from the room was okay. Food was hit and miss. Low water pressure
20,The resort and casino is nice but if you’re trying to get a good nights sleep this is not the place to stay. The room doors shut very hard that  You will wake up every time someone leaves or enters a room and there’s always fights in the hallways. The wall seemed very thin that you could hear everything . Hands-down one of the worst hotels to stay at if you enjoy a good night sleep during your vacation.
10,I had a horrible experience    I was exiting the elevator and there was water all over the marble floors    I fell down to my knees and hit my shoulder and head onto the floor    I have called many times    But no one is helping me !!!!
30,Stayed at the mirage location not the best to be able to play at m life properties. Wished the gaming floor and food options onsite were better. Over not a bad place to stay on a budget. Everything was clean and staff were friendly!
10,We have stayed at the Mirage for the last 13 years at least once a year. Our host moved on 3 years ago who was fantastic. Covid prevented us to be there for the last year and a half. we were DOCKED in our status because of that and the new host we were assigned was an idiot. Michael Abeles NEVER got back to me. And when he did he was RUDE. I asked for a new host and never heard from anyone while we were there. So much for loyalty. We will go elsewhere now.
50,Staff were all professionals rooms were c lo ran and fully stocked. Overall great experience. Would definitely stay here again. Had a wonderful girls weekend with my friends! The show and restaurants were wonderful!
40,We recently stayed at the Mirage for a business conference. I have always stayed at the mega resorts at the opposite end of the strip and was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the Mirage. Staff was super friendly resort was neat & clean & it was nice to have everything in a more compact setting. I look forward to going back once all the amenities are fully open.
50,Everything was perfect . I was able to check in online and didn’t have to wait in line to check in. The app is awesome and I love the digital key. The room was clean and room service came and cleaned the room every day.
40,The hotel staff was good and the room clean. (I do miss when they would have little pads and pens as well as a postcard of the hotel --- the gift shop did not have any postcards at all either.) I went for the reopening of Cirque's The Beatles Love and the show was excellent (again). Casino was clean and almost everyone was wearing masks. The one thing I would fault is the Pantry's food. I tried a sampling of menu items including fish & chips grilled cheese sandwich tomato soup and warm apple pie. When I think of fish & chips I think of old English f&c. The fish were two slender pieces but were good; the fries were actually potato wedges which is way too much. The grilled cheese sandwich was so-so and I wouldn't have it again not special tasting. You could do better with doing it yourself with regular bred and two slices of Kraft cheese The tomato soup was quite good. The warm apple pie was good. The items were all priced way more than I thought they were worth.
30,Our original room was a King with a normal bathroom. We missed our connecting flight and didn’t get our first night in Vegas when we checked in the next morning our room had been given away and all that was left was a King room with a “roll in”/hand held shower which flooded the floor after every shower and we stood in a puddle until we were done with towels to soak up the floor. Doesn’t seem like much of a hassle except it was our 20th wedding anniversary and I wanted the entire resort experience to be a great first trip for my husband. That was the only downer. The guy at check-in wasn’t concerned about our original room being given away.
50,The customer service was amazing the hotel is beautiful and clean. The rooms are spacious and the location is in the middle of the strip. A variety of amenities on site as well as restaurants. We will be staying again.
50,My stay was very nice starting with checking was fast and easy with very nice desk clerk and bed in room was so comfortable along with really nice bathroom. The view of the pool was nice and was able to see the strip.
40,The Mirage is still a good hotel. First hotel I ever stayed at in Las Vegas. This was my 2nd stay. The accommodations were good but not quite Bellagio. For the money it’s a good value in a great location.
50,I had a great time the place was very clean and sanitary also it had a friendly staff anytime I needed help there was no shortage of people who Could assist me. It was the most fun I had a long time. Thank you
40,Contactless checkin is great. No waiting in lines. Emails and texts when your room is ready. Our suite could have been cleaned better. Other people’s hair on the room floor.  Staff was very friendly and always greeted us in the halls.
40,Don’t think you will be disappointed. Basically a good nice property. Pool is nice get umbrella. Pantry was good for breakfast. A bit pricey but expected. Room view was not spectacular but had what we needed.
30,I stayed here in 2011 and I thought it was nice. It was cleaner and more quiet. They have the same decor from 10 years ago carpet and furniture needs to be cleaned. I never slept that good because you can hear people walking down the hall and any time someone opens and closes their door. Maybe if the bottom of the doors had a seal that might help. There was space between the door and floor so you could hear almost everything. I kept waking up!
50,The Mirage is the perfect location on strip to access multiple casinos. The mobile check in process was a plus. I recommend downloading the MGM app and turn on the location feature. Once the plane landed it immediately recognized my location and informed me that my room was ready (early check-in 11:00am) and synced the digital key to my phone. Major bonus it is the home to Beatles Love.
10,Visited for my mother’s 80th with 14 other family members in tow. The room keys for the room I got my mother did not work the entire 4 days. We had to have new keys coded multiple times a day yet nobody at the front desk found it odd nor attempted to have it diagnosed. It was like it’s part of the stay.    Also the “nonsmoking” rooms smelled as if someone took down a carton prior to our checking in.    Mirage is looking weathered and the staff seems to know it as well.
50,My family and I loved our stay at the Mirage the room was perfect except for the tub it need an update other than that it was perfect! The food service and the employees were all great. We left Caesars to stay at the Mirage best decision! The pool was perfect! We will definitely stay there in the future again.
10,I used my comp night offer for this room that was supposed to include $50 in food credit and $150 in free play I didn’t receive either. The room I chose was sold out upon check in so they did offer an upgrade which was nice unfortunately the room upon arrival looked like the cleaning was rushed… 2 empty bottles in drawers light switched looked like someone rubbed something nasty over them. On top of that I found the staff anti social and very rushed. Lastly good luck sleeping with the noise in this hotel walls are paper thin.
40,20 years later it continues to offer an awesome experience. Staff +  Resturant options + rooms +pool ++  We do not have any desire to try another location. Location is excellent to all . Various modes of transportation offered 😎
50,I was very pleased with my stay at The Mirage. Check-in and check-out went very smoothly and they actually got us into our room earlier than our scheduled check in time. Our stay was pleasant and the hotel staff was very accommodating. The hotel was very clean and the tropical setting theme it has is very beautiful. I would definitely return to stay at The Mirage again!
50,I was looking for the perfect spot for my first visit to Vegas and I landed The Mirage best decision I ever made! It’s mid strip and the rooms are large clean and beautiful. I played the black jack table for the first time and had the best I mean the best black jack dealer Fay Fortune (day shift). She never made me feel stupid for not counting fast but her personality was Grand - (find her and play a few hands and catch the vibe) I’ll be back Mirage you treaded us great!
50,Stayed 4 nights in a one bedroom suite. Far exceeded any expectations I had absolutely gorgeous with an old Vegas feel. The bed linens were so soft and comfortable it was difficult to leave the bed.
40,Enjoyed this trip to Mirage. Has a nice tropical atmosphere. Pool was fun and quite large and they let you smoke outside unlike NYNY. You can also bring drinks inside instead of getting raked over the coals. Servers are absolutely horrible in the casino however.
50,Had a fun time at the mirage. We have the best host _willie haddock . we love the restaurants. The food is always good. Employees are always friendly And helpful. We Like the selection of slot machines.
50,Amazing property and staff. Customer service was amazing. I would recommend anyone to experience this hotel/casino. Check in staff was very accommodating and took care of us on our special trip. The casino was fair and I walked away happy with long play times on the tables and slots. I’m looking forward to a trip back ASAP if I can find any deals on rooms again. Very impressed
20,My wife and I have always stayed at e Mirage and have been very displeased the last few times. I understand COVID has halted plans for improvements but this has been a few years that the hotel has been falling it seems
50,Very nice place to stay friendly staff and nice pool. This is my fourth time staying here and recommend it to everyone. Good places to eat and plenty of places to drink. Casino areas are well maintained and clean.
50,First time staying at the Mirage. We got a great deal basically paid the daily resort fee only and got a $50.00 food/beverage credit. The room was nice bathroom is a little cramped but sufficient. Bed was comfortable and the pool is very nice. Lots of lounge chairs available. Only draw back is it doesn't open until 9am. We wished it opened earlier.
50,We honeymooned here. It is a great mid-strip location. The staff is always helpful and kind. Concerns are quickly dealt with and the in-house restaurants and casino floor is fun. Heritage steak was a standout experience.
50,Will be back it for the price will make a return restaurants we’re good clean room. Vallet was quick bags were brought up to our room we checked in with the app had a Bluetooth key it was a great experience
50,It's not brand new but it is timeless clean a perfect size and very comfortable. We enjoyed our time here and cannot wait to make it back for our next trip. We enjoyed the pool the secret garden the spa services and everything that the hotel had to offer. Be sure to contact Ira in the sales office if you are looking to book a group trip. He was excellent!
50,I was due to arrive in Vegas and check in to The Mirage on 19 Jun 21. However on the flight into Vegas I had a seizure and was rushed to the emergency room at a local Hospital upon landing in Vegas. Ended up not being able to check in to the hotel until Monday 21 Jun. i had checked in on line so I already had a room assigned and was able to go straight to my room. Since i had missed the first two days of my stay I went to the front desk to inquire if i could have my charges adjusted due to my hospital stay. Come to find out two of the four days were comp days but they did waive my resort fees which was greatly appreciated. This was my second stay at the Mirage and i would highly recommend beautiful hotel friendly hotel staff and nice rooms
50,I always stay at the Mirage great location awesome pool and clean rooms. Hotel staff is always friendly. Bare pool is a must never had to wait on drinks or service. Dealers are always fun and polite. Always a great stay. See ya soon
10,"Prestigia supposedly provides for ""free"" cancellations. I booked 3 rooms at the Mirage on March 14 2021 paying a ""first night"" deposit of $412.75. I canceled within a few days after making the reservation. Now 5 months later Prestigia still has not paid me the refund they said I would receive. Do not book at the Mirage hotel if you have to use Prestigia to make the reservation. The MIrage has been no help."
30,Great location. Pool is the best on the strip. Hotel is dated. Rooms are nothing special and the AC in the room was horrible. Will stay at another property next time. Staff and restaurants are awesome
40,Only real complaint is room didnt meet my expectations as compared to other properties. Service was exceptional particularly at the pool cabana. Location is perfect center of Strip. Restaurants were great as well.
50,We always go back to the Mirage because of their awesome service the great location and our overall experience is always an awesome one. The pool is amazing and the Maroge is also a good location to select if you plan to travel with children. I never traveled with children but I’ve seen other families they’re traveling with their children and they seem to always be having a great time and the pool area there welcomes children children
50,Beautiful clean resort. Very nice pool. Slots seemed a bit tight. Rooms are nice. Wished they had a couple other food places. Star bucks was nice but usually had a long line. Overall I would stay here again
50,Stayed at Mirage last week four nights under wife's m life comp. one night under my pop slots comp and one night out of pocket. i love this resort and the folks who work at the property.    FOOD - went to Snacks 3x. Pantry 1x. Diablo's 1x. enjoyed every meal but i must say i was addicted to Snacks' tater tots...so much better than i can make in my air fryer!    CASINO - was able to parlay daily budget into a decent amount of gaming and drinks. drink service was fantastic on the floor.    ROOM - stayed on 25th floor and it was by far the nicest bathroom we've had at the Mirage across a couple handful of stays. i will stay on this floor gleefully anytime in the future. just fantastic.    STAFF - always A+. thanks everyone!    POOL - first time we've been in the pool first summer stay. not too crowded and very pleasant.    ETC - still love the sportsbook but was my first trip not putting any wagers on the sportsball. i kinda like nfl and ncaa hoops but would rather watch MLB than guess at outcomes.
30,Pool is awesome... service was quick for drinks close to guest rooms  Does need better grab and go food options  Over all in a good location  No upgrade when asked with gold vip reward card restaurants waits were way to long
50,Quiet and relaxing no nut jobs at the casinos and pool just me nice staff  Josilyn n Elizabeth at front desk helped a lot nice clean lobby  nice aquarium older folks at the pool but some 30’s  good for divorcees you won’t see Kylie Jenner types but JLO and Demi Moore types.You will see a bunch of golden girls though but they ain’t loud .
50,I enjoyed my stay. I had a business seminar there and also had comps that I was able to use which was a plus. I would stay there again. I would like to stay for fun so I could enjoy the pool and other events that you have. I wasn't able to use all of my resort credits.
10,We had a great experience before at the Mirage snd 8 years later we decided to go back. My husbands paralyzed and we were celebrating his 50th. Our bathroom flooded (how the hotel doesn’t know the bathroom did this amazes me since it’s instantaneous with a roll in shower. It took them all day to get a replacement after two trips to the front desk our new room smelled like smoke and the black out curtains were ripped. Even if you wanted to complain you couldn’t cause their phone system put you on hold and left you there for 20 plus minutes. Super disappointing.
40,We made this trip to the Mirage Casino for our 35th wedding anniversary. We arrived at around 10:30 in the morning for checkin. When we were able to get in our room we were very surprised at the size of the room. We were given a suite. This I believe is one of the best rooms that I have ever stayed in. It was very clean and the view was very nice. One thing my wife wished the room had was a tv in the bedroom area as the sofa was not very comfortable. As for the food I guess we didnt really care for the mexican restaurant. I ordered the pulled pork tacos and my wife had the taquitos. We did eat at the california pizza place where we ordered lettuce wrap and a peperoni pizza. It was very good. The waitresses in the gambling area were very friendly and for the biggest part they brought our drinks quickly. Overall we enjoy staying at the MGM casinos.
50,This time Vegas was a 4 day stop on our way to Grand Canyon Bryce Sedona etc.-- We took our daughter and 2 of our grand children (ages 24 and 25) they cannot wait to go back!!! They stayed here and thought your casino was the most fun slots music etc----we will be back next year!!!!!!!
30,The location is very good but the room was not nice for the price to stay there are nicer rooms that are less expensive. The service was okay the room was not cleaned the next day after our first night. The small fridge was locked so we couldn’t use it. I had higher expectations for this hotel which is why I decided to pay the extra amount . Disappointing
10,Old and outdated rooms. Bathrooms are small and designed for one person. There are still shower curtains and tubs. When you sit on the toilet the door almost hits you or blocks you. I've had a better stay at lower end motels. Customer service is not too helpful either and expect higher fees for everything. Resort fees parking and valet fees late check out fees in-room dining delivery fees. Beware! Stay at the Cosmo instead. They are the best!
50,Great hotel and casino! It was very nice and clean. Was able to upgrade to better floor. Only problem was the shower head was not the best. Everything wise was good. Wish they had refrigerators available for free.
40,Nice pool area and friendly staff. Check in was a breeze with the online app. Room was just OK but could have been cleaner. The resort fees are expensive and the food and drink costs are high. Decent shops
20,I would not recommend the Mirage. The check in was horrible. Only two people on staff to check in lots of guests. It took me 28 minutes to get to the counter and I was 7th in line. The people in front of me tried for 20 some minutes to get their check in on the phone app. Never got it.    As to the room it was okay but the door device kept beeping on my door and other doors down the hallway through out the night and early morning. So unless you can tune it out it would keep you awake.
50,hotel service and food was goood.  my staff was very happy and we had good time.  we had good time and we'll visit again.  I was visit mirage more then 10years right now but there's service was excellent.
40,The Staff at Mirage are excellent and housekeeping workers take great care of you nice rooms & great pool. Alot of very good dining optionsespecially check out Ken's steakhouse. We've been staying at Mirage for years and continue to book our stays there.
40,great time hotel was amazing stayed at mgm grand before like the size of mirage much better didnt get lost all the time. Only problem there was no late nite to eat anywhere. Nothing was open after 12:00.
50,Went in June and hardly had to leave the resort; it had everything! Particularly enjoyed being able to order drinks at the pool so easily just scan the bar code located on your pool chair and order on your phone! Electronic games were tight which is everywhere these days. Coffee lines were long and snaked about 20-30 feet every morning. Going again in September for birthday celebration! Great relaxing time.
40,Although I received the room complimentary through the MyVEGAS app the view we were given was not good. We had a view of a WALL with trash alongside it. Aside from that I really liked the bathroom it was very spacious and the room did not seem outdated. The pool was my favorite it has a fun vibe and I could stay out there all day. I would stay here again!
40,Great resort only wish if refrigerator was available to use without the ridiculous fee and bottle wasn’t so expensive to drink. Don’t put it in the room if your going to charge an enormous fee if you even touch the bottle. I think that is crazy. I wouldn’t think Las Vegas would need to charge someone just for looking at a bottle of water that they put in your room. Kinda silly for them to do this. Take the stocked refrigerators out of rooms and give guest a refrigerator they can use for themselves after being outside all day in the heat you can’t even come back to your room and grab a nice cold drink unless you want to pay a ridiculous amount for it. That’s insane. Get it together MGM. I think you can afford to give people a refrigerator to use without charging them. Why pay all that money for a resort fee when you can’t even use the refrigerators.
50,My sister and I came to the Mirage to chill by the pool for a few days and it couldn’t have been more perfect. The Oasis pool was perfect for this and the service top notch. I would like to give kudos to 3 employees at the Oasis pool that provided extraordinary service Devin Ariella and Patrick. They went above and beyond and should be recognized.
50,we loved it here had plenty to do and a great time. stayed for 5 nights and never was bored pool cabana was excellent food was good love the sportsbook. good location to visit other casinos in the area.
50,We love it here! We can with a group for my friends 30th. I was the only one who had stayed at the Mirage before. After our trip all 10 additional friends said they were going to exclusively start booking at the Mirage! We all loved it so much!
50,This hotel has been remodeled to keep up with newer hotels and I am impressed. The beds are soo comfy and the rooms are sleek and modern. Check in was so easy since I pre-checked in the night before and my room was ready by 11AM when we arrived. Everyone was very accomodating and the ambiance is nice. I will definitely be back.
50,As a person in a wheelchair I found my room to be accessible in every way. The breakfasts at the restaurant were great! I would stay here again! The hotel doors were automatic. The hotel is on the Strip so we could go to many other hotels and shopping areas easily.
50,Overall the experience at the Mirage was world class. I always stay at the Mirage when in Las Vegas. One thing I was surprised about was that they got rid of the Poker rooms in the casino. This was the surprised me because I had been playing cards at the Mirage for years. Besides that the hotel experience was great as always!
50,The Suite was everything I expected. It was spacious clean great view etc...The Mirage is the ideal location on the strip. It is right in the heart of everything. They were just reopening after COVID and I felt very safe with their enhanced cleaning practices.
50,Our stay was excellent you resort was extremely clean and all precautions were taken for the virus all your employees were very helpful and friendly we had a very good trip and hopefully will be back in November
50,Location food slots table games entertainment and beautiful pool all make The Mirage a great place to stay. Someone brought a football to the pool and everyone one joined in a fun game of catch. No one knew each other but we had a great time.
50,The resort was very clean with Masks & hand sanitizer for guests. We will stay again at this resort. The employees kept the resort very clean. We felt very safe with the current health issue. I would recommend this resort.
50,We loved this hotel great location beautiful pool loved the pizza restaurant staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Mirage hotel would definitely be the place we stay when we go back to Vegas!
50,As always the hotel was clean staffed and very comfortable for my stay... the best! Food and beverages was well staffed and good... using on line booking check in check out is an extremely efficient and pleasant experience !
30,My review would of been higher if more of the restaurants were open having to eat at the same restaurant day after day gets old that not what i go on vacation for . Then one day we didn't have house keeping even after walled down the hall to tell them that we where leaving for the after noon.
50,Everything was very nice. Room was large clean and comfortable. Pool was very good with the rental of the cabanas. Food options were very nice. The only problem we had was with the parking fees and use of the M card but in the end we got it straightened out.
40,I had a wonderful staying at The Mirage I stayed for 3days the agent that checking me in was awesome.. the house keepers we’re great they were fast..food was great though I wish they had a buffet in the hotel. The room view That the agent in the front desk gave me was beautiful he gave me the volcano view.. Thank you Mirage..
50,Huge fan of this hotel! I have been coming here for years and everytime I have such a great time.    The casino is always clean restaurants are nice and the pool deck is great. I will say the rooms are a little run down but I know they were not able to do their renovations due to COVID so I can look the other way on that one!    I love the location of this hotel on the strip as it is so close to everything and a cheap cab right to things a little further away.    I will continue to make this my Vegas Hotel for future trips!!
40,One of the best properties on the strip still. !!  The staff so courteous bathrooms so clean and cocktail service with a smile and on time. Craps and blackjack dealers very professional with attitude to help a novice Pkayer. Hats off to the whole staff including the outside lawn care personnel who haulted trimming trees while we moved our pool lounge chairs.
40,I loved my experience at The Mirage. The location is great in the heart of the strip. I love the tropical decor and palm trees making it one of my favorite hotel casinos in Vegas. They don't have a poker room but it's a short walk across the street to my favorite poker room at The Venetian. I got a non-smoking room but it smelled a little musty like maybe someone had smoked in there but they were really nice about getting me a different room with no hassle. Overall wonderful experience in the best part of the strip. I can't wait until they don't require masks anymore. Such a nuisance.
50,It may not be the most gorgeous but it's the most comfortable hotel on the strip! Great restaurants and by far the very best pool on the strip!! I highly recommend splurging for a cabana if you are able! The Pantry is great for breakfast and the other restaurants choices are diverse and delish! My only complaint is that the hours of some of the restaurants weren't very convenient but that's the times we are living in ...
50,My favorite Hotel/Casino on the strip. The slots are very generous and there are plenty of restaurants and shops a nice pool area and shows. It's easy to find your way around the casino floor and the rooms are very clean and updated!
50,Great hotel.Everything you need but not to big. Its location is great middle of the strip. Great pool has a tropical feel. Casino is just the right size not to big or too small. Employees were friendly and helpful
50,We loved the hotel and would stay there again. The room was very comfortable very clean and affordable. We've stayed in hotels with larger guest rooms in LV but at the price it was a very good value. They even offered a veteran's discount! Plenty of good restaurant choices and the location is right in the center of the strip convenient to everything. The pool was nice albeit crowded. The tiger exhibit is worth the visit.
50,Decided late to go out for the UFC fights called The Mirage no problem taking care of me. This place is always first rate. Be sure to try Heritage Steak and if you need a host ask for Marty he's the best.
50,Great facility. I’m sold on this resort. Clean and comfortable rooms. Wonderful check in and check out procedure friendly and helpful staff. Location location location is so true! I would stay there again in a heartbeat! Thank you Mirage for making our Vegas trip a great one.
50,2nd time we have stayed at the Mirage recently. Again another very good experience. The hotel is very clean the staff were all very friendly good restaurant selections within. The location on the strip is great with relatively easy access to many surrounding hotels/casinos. Would most definitely stay here again.
30,I don’t see a refund on my deposit of like $453  ????  This is the first time this is happen  Still waiting on my deposit back from August 10 when I checked in today is August 25 how long does it take to get that back ??
10,First day I found trash in the drawer an also i dirty mask in one of the closets i reported to the operator first day and the second day the house cleaning never went to cleaning the room so I reported to the operator because didn't had clean towels or conditioner or shampoo so they went to take clean towels but they just left them inside by the door and they never took the dirty ones or the trash
40,Great property very welcoming and super clean. North-ish end of the strip but easy to get around. Staywell beds are HARD so be prepared for that. Any issues? Just call the front desk and they’ll handle it immediately.
50,Overall we loved everything about our stay at Mirage. The only issue is one day they did a wellness check around 10 am for whatever reason. Which would have been fine but we were out late the night before and still in bed. This woke us up.
10,Horrible customer service abd horrible rooms. Took forever for us to receive towels that should have been there already. Bathroom was very outdated and rusty. The elevators and hand prints everywhere and didn’t look clean or sanitized . Save the money.
50,From the check in experience to the location close to the strip and the pool that feels like a tropical vacation Mirage keeps me coming back!! I have been to Vegas 50 times and stayed everywhere and Mirage is hands down my favourite!
40,We have enjoyed staying at the Mirage over a dozen times. It is a much cozier experience versus the other mega sized properties. The pool is our favorite compared to others. Service has always been very very high. They have kept the property up to date over the years. We will continue to come back.
50,We stayed on the Stay Well Floor 12th and it was roomy and very nice. The most important thing I loved about this room was the air purifier and how it eliminated all smells especially smoke and marijuana. My children were with me so I appreciate that. Everything was clean and beautiful at the Mirage.
50,It was the best experience I ever had at Vegas. The staff was great and very friendly. I will always tell people to stay at the mirage. Best place ever. So much to choose from coffeeto resaturatnt gambling
40,My first trip it would be nice to have someone check in with guest to make sure everything is ok. I did not see no one walking around asking if they have any questions or concerns. I seen more security guards than I did staff.  The décor was ok in my room the rug is outdated. The desk the outlet was completely out and the makeup light didn't work. It would be nice to have room service 24 hours.
40,Great location. Safe we encountered were friendly. Concierge was extremely helpful. The rooms were clean. The only thing that could have been more helpful would be more food options and shorter front desk lines.
30,The hotel room was clean upon arrival no issues. The only thing is the toilet flushing is so loud it’s startling. The pool was also extremely crowded which took away some fun but overall the stay was good.
50,Highly recommend. It’s super clean in center on the strip and staff at the mirage super friendly.  The hotel is located in a great area not to mention the volcano show it has at the main entrance. Excellent
50,Mirage a a fantastic option for a MGM owned hotel. Great location in relation to the strip varied options for dining for all budgets fantastic pool and priced among the best. Whether you are staying with family for more relaxed trip or partying hard with the guys Mirage is a option you will definitely want to look into.
20,We ponied up for a suite but it was old and run down. There were even broken windows in the room. We just weren't impressed. We got locked out of our adjoining room and they were slow to get anyone up to fix it and it took them two tries to get us in. Additionally the phone crew at the bell desk was rude and not helpful at all.
50,Great location great people and great rooms. Can’t really ask for anything else. Definitely would stay again. Super easy to get around and centrally located on the strip right in the middle of everything.
30,Stayed here to be in the same hotel to meet with friends. For the price paid + resort fee it was expensive and nothing distinguishing to make me want to stay again in the future. Issue with the TV (needed front desk to fix) the shower was the water conservation style (spewing out water). Ventilation system in the bathroom not the best should have anti-fogging mirror in the bathroom. The room just seemed dated. The TV was obviously a smaller replacement than what was originally installed as the wood bracing was oversized. Positive - the digital key remote check in and check out (although I still haven't received my invoice yet).
50,Love this place staff and facilities are outstanding located in the best spot in the strip to access other casinos. Rooms were great as well as house keeping they did an incredible job I really appreciate that.
20,If there are zero issues with your stay then this place is fine. But if you encounter any issues like your keys not working ice machine broken on your floor unclean room at check in ect. Just know your only solution will be to walk 2miles back to the front desk wait in line and be told what you can do yourself to fix it. Also don’t believe their “upgrade” lies. I’ve stayed here twice the first I encountered the non working keys so waited 20mins ouside the door to enter a dirty room. When I made the walk back to the desk she was apologetic and was going to change rooms and upgrade me to a casino host room. Made some calls and a fuss that someone else was getting bumped for me but talked it up like we were getting this amazing room as an apology… It was only two floors higher and was the EXACT same room but with a strip view. Why the front desk agent put on that show I’ll never understand. This stay was for my bf’s bday and I was using a app game comp stay I earned so was willing to pay for an upgrade to a suite or what I requested and really wanted was a great tub. Front desk is going to hook me up has this one room left on a high floor but warns its a bad view but awesome tub. I’m all in for that and hey aren’t going to charge me for an upgrade- I’m thinking this is so awesome tip the guy well and get to the room… well it has a tub at least. Its a deeper soak style but has probably been there 20+ years as tubs don’t usually get renovated as often as rooms. Again the room is fine but the build up of this amazing free upgrade and awesome tub only one left I’m really hooking you up makes for a huge letdown. It really doesn’t make any sense when they aren’t trying to get me to spend more on a room and just lie about what they are giving me.  Overall the room is alright. Definitely aged with the lumpy mattress and loud bathroom fan to match. No built in usb outlets by the beds (2 on alarm clock) but had the built in TV port connectors. The lighting choices were strange and the bathroom was blinding with far too many mirrors (unless you like watching yourself doing your business). I’m sure other rooms are better this was a “free” room so I’m sure that reflects the quality. I’ll be choosing a different hotel for my rewards stays as they have always been much better. However its the terrible and strange service not the lackluster room that will keep me from returning here.
30,Don’t plan on bringing drinks and food back to the room to go in a refrigerator because there is no room it’s full of over price liquor and snacks to purchase also the water does not get that hot only good thing housekeeping is working everyday
50,The staff was friendly and helpful. Checkin was quick and my request were acknowledged.  My room was ready and I had a view of the strip. I enjoyed my view of the volcano going off nightly.  The food at Pantry for breakfast and dinner at Stuck was very tasty
40,Overall it’s a nice hotel with great location and amenities. I had a bad view but in general spent very little time in the room so it didn’t really matter. The pool was nice; however my only complaint is the lack of shade around the pool. Pool chairs are simply next to each other with no umbrellas to provide shade. There were some chairs that had shade for an additional price; however I think this is a bad amenity to try to profit off of since the long term consequence is increasing skin cancer risk. The hotel should really be more selective about ways to make extra money.
50,Very nice resort we had a great time and felt safe the whole time. The room was clean. Low score on the cleanness of the windows and the curtains were old and need to be replaced. Prices for the mini bar are not clearly listed either.
50,I had a lot of fun gambling and eating at the different restaurants. I was by myself but the staff didn’t make me feel like that. It was very clean and the staff was super friendly. I will definitely be visiting this casino again. Planning the next trip real soon.
20,The window is cannot close entirely. It’s too noisy. I can hear the noise from outside. And the shower gown they provide is very dirty. I can see the dark stain in the in and outside of the gown. I think they didn’t wash it at all.
40,My family had an excellent time staying here. The restaurants within the hotel were amazing and there was just enough amenities. Also location was perfect and we were able to walk to almost everything on The Strip. My only negative is the quality of sleep. I was able to hear every sound in the hall during the middle of the night. I would recommend bringing ear plugs if you are a light sleeper.
50,I loved the smell ambiance and location of the Mirage on the strip. I will definitely stay there again. My favorite place for breakfast was at The Pantryand drinks were great at the Still as well. The Mirage doesn’t disappoint!
50,I had a great experience while at Mirage for WPPI conference. The rooms were great and they had easy access to the conference rooms. Only thing that was an issue was internet speed at times. Made it difficult to send photos. Otherwise it was all great.
50,This is not the first time staying at the Mirage. The rooms are so clean. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I will stay here every time I am in Vegas. I highly recommend this hotel for business or pleasure!
40,I enjoyed my experience. Just wish the rooms were a little nicer. Carpet needed to be cleaned up. The dealers at the tables were some of the best I’ve had the pleasure of playing with. Very nice and helped make the game clear to understand for beginner players
50,Our adult children joined us for our anniversary. Great restaurants pool cabana and cocktails….mirage is the best! Love the changes and upgrades they’ve made. Just need walk in showers and it would be perfect!!
50,Beautiful resort and pool area  dolphin show was great plenty of slots and bars to unwind. Comfortable bed in a large room for a king.Very quiet room and enough elevators so there was no wait. I also really liked digital check in and key on phone.
50,Everything was very good to excellent. The staff was very friendly and willing to help. The restroom facilities throughout were clean and free of odors. Housekeeping stayed on top of the little things. The hotel provided a variety of things to do
50,Excellent stay dinned in most of the restaurants on site. Absolute favorite was the The Stack. Bedrooms comfortable. Dust in places excited so not fooled by the enhanced cleaning. But all the main parts were good toilet/shower/fresh sheets. the on site amenities pools poolside bars and attractions are nice cool and not over the top on pricing
20,Beautiful resort but it's time to update the rooms. Shower was not functioning properly. Towels are old and rough. Room temperature was not cool enough for a 100 degree day. We spoke to other friends in our group and they were experiencing similar problems with the rooms being too hot. We contacted the front desk and the person they sent told us that the filters were dirty.
30,Our stay was ok. The bathroom was a huge let down. It was our honeymoon and we wanted at least a tub bigger than ours at home. The shower head was leaking and handle was broke. The rest of the room was decent. No access to fridge for placing your own water in it. The streaming movies privileges. This was our first time to Vegas and the volcano view was unimpressive. We couldn't even find it at first. Loved the pool and Tom Collichios restaurant however!
50,Stayed for 4 nights to speak at a conference. Check in was very good. Room was clean and comfy. Bathroom was a bit dated and small. Food choices were slightly limited but good. TV service was abysmal but who stays for tv? Overall I liked this over many of the other strip casino hotels.
50,I had lots of fun at the mirage . overall it is a good hotel to stay at. There is a lot to do and the staff is wonderful. The food is also amazing at the mirage my favorite part about the mirage is that it is affordable .
40,We stayed for 3 nights at the Mirage in mid August. We had a comp offer that included $50 resort credit and $50 free play.    Check in was quick and easy. With Mlife Gold I asked about an upgrade to the tower rooms. I was willing to pay but the gentleman said there was nothing available. I had originally booked a king room but said I was willing to take any bed configuration to receive the best room possible. We received a 2-queen room on the 22nd floor facing south with a strip view.    The room itself was very clean and was a decent size. You can definitely see the age of the rooms but what struck us was that basic maintenance wasn't kept up. Knobs on the drawers were loose and the faucets in our bathtub were falling off. The beds are firm. Overall I don't have any real complaints but the bathrooms are quite small.    The hotel included a little care package that included masks and hand sanitizer. The mini bar was still in the room as were all the toiletries. The room was cleaned daily.    Great friendly service all over the resort. Great drink service at the slots. The hotel appeared to be very clean and well taken care of. It's not a huge resort and quite easy to navigate.    We rented loungers at the private Oasis pool and felt these were well worth the cost. The loungers are incredibly comfortable. They also included umbrellas water and they even passed out refreshing lemonade. The service from the server and the support staff was really great. Drink and food prices are what you would expect. We charged this to the room and our resort credit helped to off set some of the cost.    We also ate at Snacks inside the Mirage which we felt was quite good. Large portion sizes so you could share. Most things seemed to be open but had varying operational hours. We also saw Shin Lim in their theatre which was amazing.    The location of the Mirage can't be beat! I would stay here again.
30,Staff very friendly. Rooms a little dated. Great housekeeping staff. There was not enough staff during check in. First impressions go a long way. After a long day of travel this should be the easiest part of the trip not the longest.
50,My wife and I just spent a couple of days at The Mirage casino in Vegas. The location on the strip was excellent. Close to tons of fun attractions and shops. The casino was super clean and well maintained. Pool was great and service at the pool was great. Dealers were all nice. Table waitresses could have been more attentive but otherwise absolutely great time!
40,It’s time to remodel the Maroge needs to remodel the rooms in most cases they are tiny the bathrooms are tiny the beds are the hardest I’ve ever tried to sleep on what the housekeeping is excellent and the valet service is probably the best in Las Vegas  The Hotel should also consider shuttle service to and from Allegiant Stadium it would be a great amenity for hotel guests
50,Had a great time staying at The Mirage. Check in is so easy now with mobile check in no wait at all and super easy to use. Customer service is awesome and food is delicious. Overall super satisfied with this trip.
50,We flew into Vegas and stayed at the mirage for 3 nights. We arrived late at night. Check in was a little slow but you can check in at kiosks. I had two rooms booked and could only check in to one online for whatever reason so I had to go to the desk. We have conjoining room. The rooms were clean and the bed was comfortable! We went to the pool one day. We were able to get chairs. The pool was clean and a comfortable temperature. I would definitely return to the mirage.
40,Mirage was very nice place to stay.  Easy walking to other major resorts.  Drinks a little to high for what you get.  Bring a jacket they keep it cool. Pool area is real nice. Cute shops and restaurants.
50,So the Mirage had a $69 room rate (plus $45 resort fee) on Monday and Tuesday which is an unbelievable deal. Got a room on the 23rd floor with a pool view. The rooms are a little bit dated but the rooms are clean and the beds are excellent. The pool at the Mirage is the best on the strip.
40,everything was fine. You wont be disappointed. Pool was nice and its next to other very nice hotels and casinos. Wish they had a beach club in it but o well. The food places to eat at in there were good. DIABLOS!! and the STILL were very good.
50,We came for a conference but had a wonderful anniversary experience too. The conference was lovely (the convention rooms are clean comfortable temperature and lovely) but the pool and the dining were beyond compare. The staff was exceptional.
50,We had such a blast we went over to celebrate my brother in law birthday and we did everything as planed we love going to las Vegas at least once a month the mirage is one of our favorite hotels to stay at.
40,The room was very clean and well decorated. Mirage is first class all the way. The restrooms in the casino were the cleanest I've ever been in! Took a beating in the casino but the scenery at the pool more than made up for it.
30,Room was dirty hair all over the bathroom pool was decent but drinks seemed higher than normal. Rooms were ok but seemed dated tried to upgrade but was told there were none available even suites. Will try another hotel next trip
50,I work 3 jobs and hadn’t had a vacation in 2 years partly due to mandatory closures but I finally had the opportunity to get away with family and I chose the Mirage LV. It is a beautiful place that is centrally located to all the action on the strip. The rooms are extremely comfortable and mine had a perfect view of the erupting volcano in the evening. There are plenty of great place to dine as well as my personal favorite go to place Starbucks. The pools are so welcoming with waterfalls flowing over a volcano into the water. The staff is always nearby to offer drinks or a massage or you can head over to the poolside bar or have a bite to eat at the Paradise Cafe located at the pool entrance. I love this place and will be back again. Oh I must include that at the time of this review the staff at the Mirage make sure your health and safety are at the upmost importance. The staff keeps things wiped down and have sanitizing stations throughout the casino and they do require mask wearing regardless of vaccination status. I pray for the safe and well being of everyone and I hope one day soon we can all get back to a more safe and sound way of life. Take care everybody I love you and God Bless everyone.
20,I rented 2 rooms  one was fine the other had a bad mold smell. I think air conditioner filter needed to be cleaned or changed. Had to pay additional fee for parking not included in resort fee also walk from parking to hotel room was exceptionally long so if disabled you might want to reconsider staying here.
40,In Vegas for a convention. As always the Mirage excels. The difference this time was the lack of ability to get the room temperature to a comfortable level even keeping the drapes closed. At times tempted to sleep in the hall.
30,Paid for three nights but hotel only shows one so issues there. On 23rd floor. Room is OK but bath room is dated. Mini fridge has computer so do not touch or add anything or you will be charged. Reminds me of SW or Frontier where everything is extra. As I said in general room is OK but need a reservation or pay for a lounge at the pool. Just too much sticking it to you for me and service very average.
30,The Mirage has obviously been around for a long time. The age shows in the rooms. The location is great the pool is great Starbucks on site and plenty of restaurants. The rooms just need a makeover.
50,Was there for a trade show. My usual place where we stay is MGM but Mirage was closer so we stayed there. Wow. We were very happy with the size and location of the place. The gaming atmosphere was incredible. Staying again
40,I was told it would be a $100 incidental daily rate authorized however the checkin clerk held $200 a day. The line was so long that I didn’t want to debate it. I was upset because I confirmed this over the telephone before I walked into the building! I know that this sounds petty. I just don’t like the being told one thing and something else being done! The check in line was sooo long! I just didn’t want to wait to see how long a manager or supervisor would come over to verify who was right!
10,Overall stay was uncomfortable and not what I expected in a hotel such as Mirage. Some issues that were addressed were resolved others were not. Bathtub was clogged with debri and hair which was gross. There were multiple curls in the rug which caused me and my family to trip multiple times in the guest room. Unable to adjust the temperature in the room which made sleeping in Vegas summer nights uncomfortable. Issue was reported but never addressed
10,Had to be moved to 3 different rooms. All 3 had dirty sheets. One had moths and reeked of strong cigarette and weed smell. Carpets looked like they haven't been vacuumed in days. Staff was nice but will never stay there again!
50,Had a great time!! My fiancé and I as well as our best friends came to get married and renew their vows started at one hotel that was not up to par and was able to get a couple of rooms at the last minute. This was huge blessing. Convenience and location was awesome!!
40,It has been several since I stayed at The Mirage. I remember it being a superior property. My room had serious issues including a very uncomfortable bed and a bathroom in sore need of a good cleaning. Outside the room the resort overall was beautiful. However looking closely it appears that overall maintenance has suffered and the hotel is losing its luster.
30,First of all like to say at a wonderful time.  However a couple Of improvements should be made first off the bathrooms in the room are very small and I consider them like the Days Inn. Next they should just lower the music at the pool. I noticed that the hotel was starting to look dated meaning that they need a little spruce up here and there. The casino seemed pretty decent for the most part. I do believe that they should add a few more restaurant venues that are a little less expensive. Overall I would definitely stay there again I just think that it’s time to make some of these updates.
50,Very clean! Everyone was nice and helpful! Check in and out was quick and easy! Easy to get ride shares! The pool area was very nice! The resort was close to everything on the strip! Will be back again!
10,I was told I could reserve a room with a king bed. When I arrived to check in I was told my room was no longer available. The only room that was available was a senior citizen room. It was very stuffy and dusty in the room. I kept sneezing. When I called the front desk to complain about my experience I was simply told “you agreed to the room there’s nothing we could do.” My wife and I were disappointed. If I knew the room would’ve been unavailable we could’ve booked at a neighboring establishment.
50,The whole check in process on your mobile device was excellent. I have back problems so standing in line to be checked in is hard this was fast and easy. All the staff we came in contact with was great!
40,The hotel is on one end of the strip so the location isn’t very convenient. But the hotel was clean the drinks are affordable and checking-in was extremely convenient. We never had to wait a long time to get on the elevator. The room was comfortable and clean even though you could tell it was outdated. Whatever you do don’t remove anything from the fridge to store your own personal items. There is a restocking fee of $50 even if you don’t consume any of the items.
20,We arrived late at night. They had 3 people checking people in and we waited about an hour.    Our room had a smell when we walked in (bad). The carpet was wet in one area and very dirty. It needs to be cleaned or replaced. Typical hotel room set up. Decore is dated. The beds were nice and comfortable. We will probably not stay there again. Great location though.
20,Room smelt like mold coming from the closet and the restroom but mostly the closet and after a call to the front desk nothing was done about it the whole night. Engineering department came up at midnight and said someone would contact our room in the morning but no one ever came.
30,Vegas has always been a favorite place of mine to visit. I don’t know if Vegas is changing a full 360 but things for sure aren’t the same as they used to be out of all the years I’ve traveled there. My first time staying at the mirage we check in and I asked for parking validation since we were staying at the hotel they refused validation and insisted I add parking for $15 and I can go and come as I please out the hotel with a card. I agreed. The card to enter or leave the hotel never worked although mirage didn’t make us pay for those time we left the hotel. The ac in the room was not working. Stayed at 72 degrees all day. I called twice to have it fixed and they explained they handle it remotely. Well remotely didn’t work. I called a third time and someone came to the room to make an adjustment. Other than that there really isn’t many restaurants for early risers.
40,"Overall experience was very good except for housekeeping at the Mirage. After placing the ""privacy please"" sign on the door housekeeping still woke us up every single morning of our stay. We asked them not to on the first day and it did not change for the entire week."
50,This is my 4th stay at The Mirage and I love that it’s an all-in-one spot. The hotel is big but it doesn’t feel that it takes forever to get it your room. There’s a lot to do in one hotel. Very close to the strip. Lots of delicious restaurants bars slots the pools is really nice there’s exhibits and even a Cirque De Soiel show. You don’t need to go far to have a great time and that’s what you want in a hotel in Vegas. Everything is close and easy to navigate.
30,Stay was ok. Staff was great. Older hotel. Things closed early which I understand given low staff with covid. Check in was easy. Price was lower than some other options. Italian food restaurant was good room service eh.
10,Dirty windows and mirrors  Broken closet doors  Ancient hair dryer  No room service after hours  No food vending machines  Long long lines to check in  Extra charge for room up to $400.00 ($100.00 per night up to 4 nights)  Rude staff  Very Very Expensive with very little perks or complimentary services
50,I’m not one to leave reviews but feel like this one is well deserved. The staff went above and beyond during our stay to keep us happy travelers! The pool is amazing and restaurant selection is great!
10,It has been the worst I’ve had at any hotel on the strip. A few things to complain about include:    1. The air filter was disgusting not very sanitary to be breathing in dusty air.    2. The air conditioning in the room did not go lower than 68 even though it was set lower than that. Most of the time the temperature was around the low 70s.    3. On two different occasions I called housekeeping and the front office for extra towels and an extra pillow. My first attempt was around 11pm and the second around 1:30. All they said was that they would send them and never received them.    4. I called the front desk at 10am for extra towels to shower before I left as I never received them the night before. The front desk was gracious to extend my checkout until 12 to have time for our showers. Midway through my shower maintenance came and knocked on the door saying that the water would be shut off for 20 minutes. I had to finished my shower a lot faster than I would have liked.
10,Do not stay at this hotel!!! Our room smelled like smoke. Blood on our sheets. Shower light leaked in bathroom. No dial tone on phone so I couldn’t call the front desk. We left after 15 hours. I told the front desk and they did nothing to help us. We booked at the bellagio on our own after I asked the front desk of the mirage to help us book at their sister resort. They said they couldn’t do anything for us. Bellagio is so much better!!! Do not stay here.
10,Rooms were dirty. You can hear every door slam every conversation and in my case full meltdown argument in the hallway. Casino is littered with cigarette butts and ash on the slots them selves no ashtray. The table games are all dated and stained. Honestly save your money for a little longer and stay at a nicer hotel.
20,We used Myvegas comp night for 2 night stay was not greeted nicely by the check in person. We had to ask for available upgrades which my family was willing to pay and was told there was non available while Mlife website and many rooms available. Received one of the worst rooms with bed spring broken small restroom with rust build up and lack of hygiene amenities and parking view. Door key didn't work the next day and we had to go down to check-in desk to have it fixed. Ended up gambling at Treasure Island because of there were many perks including freeplay tournament and winning more as a new member compared to my mlife gold status. Also my girlfriend preferred the Treasure Island rooms compared to the mirage.
20,Got the wrong room number written on our room key spent so much time arguing with my wife because of it. The room was falling apart. I got no where fast with all my luggage for the lack of carts and lack of helpful staff.
50,I’ve been to Vegas several times but no other hotel I’ve stayed at comes close to the Mirage. Everyone we talked to was kind and helpful providing us with any information we needed. I’m definitely coming back and staying at the Mirage next time I visit Vegas!  Thank you to all the staff at the Mirage!
50,Came for only one night to get our marriage license for our up coming wedding. We had the best time and service at the mirage! I would highly recommend staying there! We will be back in October along with our 50 guests!
30,Staff is incredible  Location is pretty good  Hotel is getting old.. I mean carpets everywhere it starting to smell like where my grandfather would hang out.. just saying. It’s smells like an old strip joint
30,For the price it’s a good place to stay we have stayed at the mirage twice and it’s a average priced nice hotel the bathroom was not what was shown on the pictures but still ok  we was bummed that the buffet was closed because they have a really good buffet
40,"The Mirage is a nice hotel. The casino leaves a lot to improve upon in my opinion. Never enough tables open people always standing behind others waiting for an opening to play while other tables remain closed. No ""matinee prices"" no cheap tables for new gamblers to play/learn on. the waitstaff for drinks while gambling is very understaffed. The Front desk help was very helpful when needed but again understaffed. Be prepared to wait in a long slow moving line. The House Keeping staff are awesome! They are like cleaning ninjas in and out with excellent results. Wish there was more in room amenities. A coffee pot or refrigerator to use in the room goes a long way with people on vacations or business trips."
50,Very friendly staff and clean rooms. Mobil check in was a breeze. No lines to wait in to get access to the room. The pool was really nice and the service level superior. Prices a little high but isn’t most of Vegas anymore
40,Great place for a convention. Coffee shop doesn’t open until 6:00 so if you’re an early riser find alternative means for your premium coffee fix. Clean rooms friendly staff. Wasn’t disturbed by the people in other rooms next to me. Only occasional hall way noise.
50,Excellent place to stay rooms were clean restaurants bars pool secret garden casino were great! The Limitless Show was fantastic! The service and staff were wonderful! Had an excellent time at The Mirage Thank you!
50,We were allowed to check in early due to change on flight time. Got to room and didn’t notice till our return later that evening our outlets to re-charge our electric devices were dead. Called front desk said would be handled 3 days later finally repair man came. We were they offered room change to suite with private pool bath room you could sleep in and complimentary food and drinks for our family for the reminder of our stay.    Started rough but finished well and they all gave us access to snacks and beverages from in room mini bar at no cost.    Definitely would stay again. Breakfast at hotel was also good
40,I've stayed at quite a few hotels on the Strip and the Mirage has been by far my favorite place to stay. If you're looking for a hotel that isn't club-centric and focuses on the relaxing side of things then the Mirage is for you.    The pool is incredible the restaurants are great the casino pays out every time I've gone and the room service is awesome. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the rooms themselves do need an update. Nothing horrible but peeling trim and some rust in the tub makes you give a little side-eye.
50,Beautiful rooms were roomy not cramped well stocked. Clean although bathroom could be larger. Housekeeping was helpful & thorough. Several choices for food although could be a bit daunting if you are not computer literate.
10,Was lied to about room availability upgrade so they could maximize profits during the week. Was told no suites avaliable all week checked back next day all avaliable and way more expensive. Left 3 days early went to ceasers.
30,Rooms were nothing special as long as you don't mind mold and cigarette smells. Loud people in the hallways at 2am nobody there when you dial front desk bit the food was good! And cmon the pool closes at 7pm....that's very annoying
50,Beautiful hotel with great customer service. Room was great. Bathroom throughout the hotel were kept very clean. Monorail access is across the street. Center of the strip with access to virtually anything you want to do.
50,"We stayed in one of their ""stay well"" rooms and it was very nice. The staff are all pleasant and helpful and the rooms were spotlessly clean. We had a great time in the casino too. The only thing we missed was the buffet which was always excellent. Don't know if it will eventually reopen."
50,Everything was great smooth sailing from arrival to departure. No complaints whatsoever and the Restaurants within the Hotel & Casino I visited were all awesome. I would definitely go back 100% and I do in fact plan to stay there my next trip in the next upcoming months.
50,Excellent facility friendly and helpful staff. Good restaurants and very good service. B48 was a wonderful suite. Decorated very well and extremely well maintained. I highly recommend and will definitely come back.
50,Really enjoyed our stay. Room was amazing / service / all excellent. Loved lounging by the pool cold beers and cocktails. Gambling was fun and drink service attentive. The only down side was we had to leave. Back soon though
20,1980s called and they want their decor back! The hotel is outdated. The volcano is a nice attraction. The bed was comfy. Hotel didn't offer much in the way of restaurants/bars. The staff was friendly and management resolved the problem I experienced with a leaky toilet. Don't let the gold tinted windows fool you. All that glitters is not gold.
20,My room smelled like urine and I paid $25. extra so that my room overlooked the fire show only to find out that the fire show was being worked on - I would like my money back - also I received an email that said free room but when I got there I was changed $200
40,My stay was fantastic. The only issue I had was that the hallways seemed to be a little loud with the noise coming into the room. Noise level from the other rooms and outside was great. Other than the hallways I have no complaints.
50,The staff was friendly the check in lobby did everything in their power to accommodate. The valet and bell service was exceptional and quick! Location is prime and the variety of food is just right. The pool service was excellent and had an amazing waitress cater to every need. My only objection is that when I reserved the daybed at the pool the description included a bucket of waters and we were told when we arrived that they no longer do the bucket of waters. Please remove that description when reserving a daybed.
40,"We just returned from a 3 night stay at the Mirage. We had an absolutely wonderful and relaxing time. Prior to boarding our plane with used the MGM resort app to check in to our room. By the time we landed we had a message assigning us a room number and digital key. This is a VERY cool feature. We never had to wait in line to talk to anyone at the desk just went straight to our room! I was worried that the pool might hit ""capacity"" and we wouldn't get in but were told by the pool desk that it has not been an issue. We really enjoyed our pool time in the summer heat! The casino was clean and we had a lot of fun playing games. Yes there is a mask mandate but if you are activly drinking you do not need to wear it. I don't love cigarette smoke so it was fine with me to wear it. The only real reason I am giving 4 start instead of 5 is that there weren't a lot of dining options. Several restaurants including the buffet were still closed and others are only open on certain days of the week. We never had a problem making a reservation but it definitely limited our options."
20,The mobile check in and mobile check in kiosk in the Mirage are great. It makes it super easy and convent to check in and check out. It is located in the middle of the strip so it is in a great place with easy access to everything. But the quality of the room is poor specifically the bathroom. The bathroom is in desperate need of updating. There were rust spots everywhere and peeling wallpaper. The shower drain and sink drain were both clogged and slow draining in my room. I told the hotel staff this 3 times and they did not fix it nor offer to switch my room. Just kept saying they would send someone up. The bathroom was also not thoroughly cleaned before I arrived. I walked across the street to Walgreens to get cleaning supplies to clean it. Walgreens is close so that's another good thing. I would probably never stay at the Mirage again there are too many other hotels on the strip to choose from.
40,It was ok I understand with Covid EVERYWHERE you go is under-staffed but I was expecting a bit more from am MGM property.  I've stayed at 3 other MGM properties and this was a first for MIRAGE. Sadly I don't anticipate returning.  PROS: The pool was nice and OMG the DOLE WHIPS were AHH-MAZING. (Maybe I can come back for a Dole Whip (lol)
30,I couldn't get over the musty scummy bathroom smell. It smelled like an old gym locker shower. But the bed was nice. Terrible room location for a Gold member of Mlife. I'm also a Mlife credit holder.    I felt it was nothing in used to when I book comp rooms at the Bellagio. They airways give me a nice view. Shorter distance to my room. I booked this 2 months ago.. I expected now from Mirage... now I know better.
30,Shin Lim show was excellent. Sushi was not good- very bland too much batter on tempura over salted fish. Guest room was dirty and digital key cards didn’t work on elevator or the room. Had to get help from security.
30,I love the grounds and entrance and feel of the hotel overall. But room and experience in general was just average. I had hoped for more in the room and pool. Seemed like most of the places I wanted to go were quite a bit away.
50,Our stay at the mirage was amazing. Friendliest staff I have encountered on the strip and cleanest rooms and casino floor. The highlight of our trip at the mirage was the dolphin habitat. We did not get to see a show but the training session with the dolphins was amazing!!!
20,There was information that was communicated to us when we checked in. We had to find out information about how the AC operates once a problem was reported and then had to find out about the refrigerator at check-out. Don't fall for paying extra for the strip view ... we had a nice view of the pool but there was very little of the strip from our room. Not worth the extra fee! Would not stay here again.
30,Pool area too crowded. Charges to the room have to be monitored although the error was fixed. AC unit needs an upgrade. Bathroom tub was rusted and sheets were stained but replaced promptly. Second stay the first was better but we're in a pandemic!
30,They have Fire show at 8pm 9pm …  However I saw some ducks on the pool. The water became hot n the ducks had to jump out from the pool    It’s not related to hotel rooms but it’s a part of his show. Whenever someone tells me how good his fire show is I remember the ducks on the pool
40,"PROS:  -Room was great spacious lovely decor  -Casino was clean with alot options  -Food was wonderful ate at Heritage Steak it was amazing.    Now coming to the Mirage from another MGM property (NoMad Hotel also located in Las Vegas which was great). I was excited to experience what this hotel had to offer. But this was first interaction which the hotel and it's staff:    The check-in process was a little embarrassing there was an incident with a hotel staff worker that made the assumption that I was in the wrong line(priority MLife line) I'm guessing it had something to do with my appearance of me and my guest(my father and myself) we are African Americans and on first view the only ones that were in line there were alot of people that did not look like us in line as well. The Caucasian middle/upper aged gentlemen hotel worker had come directly to us bypassed other guests never spoke to the other guests standing in line and asked us if we were in the correct check in line(which we were).  He had made the comment directly to us that ""This is the line for ""Priority Check-In""for M-Life Reward Members the guest Check-In is over there"".  NOT once did that gentlemen say  'hello how are you or let me assist you'... And I responded "" I know it's the Priority Line that's why I walked over here I can read thank you"" He then walked away. He never apologized.  It was super embarrassing and we felt like it had something to do with skin color considering we were the only black people in the line. He ask nobody else about line placement except us. This experience made us feel a little unwanted and made me question the inclusivity of being a MLife Gold member."
30,Rented a penthouse. $900 a night for me is a lot so I expected a lot. Room was beautiful grounds were beautiful but our particular room (the bathroom) wasn't very clean. Drapes were broken bathroom TV was broken. Aside from one front desk guy the staff was not friendly. Most acted like they were doing us a favor by helping us. I usually like The Mirage. I have stayed many times. This time kind of turned me off and I think I will look elsewhere next time.
50,Had Ms. Willi do my men's haircut at Mirage Spa & Salon....awesome cut and style !  I had gotten a perm after 25 years....to celebrate my return to Little Chapel of the West where I got married ...to go to my daughter's wedding.  My perm was not done right...not cut to shape....so Willi fixed me up to look the part and give my daughter away and party in Vegas Baby !    Go see Willi...you will glad you did.
50,- Great location (close to a nice mall)  - Safe and clean Resort  - Pool is excellent but busy need to get there early  - Price is good  - Rooms are perfect  - check in and out was fast    - No more poker room  - had issues with our room keys
50,Our first stay at Mirage and we loved it!! Evan at the front desk was very nice and helpful at check in and beyond. Great rooms!! The Pantry is a great place for breakfast. Pool was fun but relaxing. We will be back!!
30,We had a pretty good trip. We have been coming to Las Vegas annually since 2009. The Mirage was one of the better places we have stayed. I think our biggest problem with the trip wasn’t the Mirage itself but rather the inflation of all the prices of everything mainly food. You can hardly find a meal for a family of 3 under $100. Although we enjoyed ourselves we will probably not be coming to Las Vegas annually anymore. This will probably be a trip every 3 years because of the expense of it. We will probably pick another destination for most years. And again this is solely based on the increase in prices since Covid. I’m guessing Las Vegas is trying to make up for what they lost this past year. Our breakfast at the grab-n-go Snacks restaurant cost us $78 without tip! Pretty insane.
50,Mirage is located on the strip. Easy to walk to other hotels. Drink prices are expensive in the pool area so prepare yourself. The casino is spacious with alot of help. I would stay there again in the future.
10,Our room was so dirty! It was disgusting! Couldn’t get a chair at the pool on an average Tuesday. Couldn’t even get in. It was so crowded. Checkin line at 11 am on a Tuesday was a 45 minute line. Don’t stay here!
50,Staff will fix the problem fast. I had an issue with my room. They went above and beyond to fix it for me and my family. And the managers do their job and always have a smile no matter how busy they got.
10,Pros- nice staff    Cons - The room felt dirty  Toilet was leaking  No refreshments (which we were charged everyday for  We paid for strip view but didn’t even have a view of the strip  Room was outdated    Staying at the cosmo next time    Mirage is a cool spot but didn’t have a great experience for the price we paid
20,My title says it all. Filthy dirty carpet. Sad beds that were very uncomfortable. No coffee maker or fridge. Crumbling tiles in the beat up old bathroom with nasty dirty grout. There are plenty of hotels to choose from. Why choose this one.
50,Service was great. Pool was great. Really enjoyed it. I love how it’s right in the middle of the strip. Access to everything. Pool was awesome. Plenty of space to go around and see around. Gym was kinda small.
30,The room we had was next to the elevator so we got zero sleep listening to the motor and system all night. Food was way overpriced $5 for a 16oz soda from the fountain is an example. Slots were TIGHT!
40,I did enjoy my stay at the Mirage. It offers a central location & the resort was well taken care of & clean. I did have some issues with our room but that may have just been my own personal preferences. (The pillows offered NO support & using 2 would elevate my head too much. Also the mattress was firm & the AC unit while set at 65 degrees for our ENTIRE stay hardly felt as If it was that cold within our room. I slept with only a sheet no comforter and was still quite warm.) The restaurants the resort & the casino was nice although the casino is a little bit smaller than most casinos on the strip if that is important to you. We also went to the Secret Garden (the Siegfried & Roy attraction) & I was quite disappointed. The dolphins attraction was merely a large pool with a small underground viewing area & the white tiger park was a very brief walk through a small enclosed paddock. You could do both exhibits (including  the dolphin show with the trainers) in about 30-45 minutes. It was NOT worth it! In conclusion I would recommend the Mirage & would stay there again!
40,Keys sometimes don’t work properly and also there are no locks on bathroom doors for rooms other then that the staff is very friendly and they do a great job cleaning the rooms while you’re away and overall I had a great time on the slots
50,This was a great place to stay. Great rooms very clean. Great Casino. They had low betting and high betting games. Very friendly staff. They had allot of activities for the kids. Overall a great stay.
10,Overall I felt this establishment was ill prepared for our stay in which we were there to celebrate our 1 year anniversary of marriage. I wish there was room for some positivity however that would only be the value as we used my rewards member ship to comp the room. Unkempt  unsanitary rooms unprofessional staff on floors and staff was not enforcing mask use while we’re in the middle of a global pandemic with new variants creating more havoc than ever. Terrible experience! Do bot recommend.
50,This was a good hotel with a pretty good location. The rooms were clean and the service was great. We had a great stay. Housekeeping was awesome with changing out the sheets and cleaning up the room everyday.
10,Went for birthday. Lied to about room reservations. Bath tub broken. safety latch broken. hotel housekeeping ce into room even though do not disturb sign on door. require mask yet at pool chairs close
40,Visited the Mirage for 3 nights. I loved the check in from the app that made it super easy. We always seen long lines at the front desk and we were able to avoid that. Upon arrival after inspecting the room we noticed several hairs and some debri on the carpet. I don’t think it had been vacuumed before our arrival. I always wear shoes in a hotel room anyways but it for sure could if been cleaner. We had a good stay loved the pool area. We had dinner one night at Diablos and it was not good. The little bit of steak that gave us was burnt and tasted like charcoal salsa would set your mouth on fire and thats from someone who eats hot stuff. Avoid this place if staying at the Mirage!
50,The Mirage was very clean friendly and near everything. I would stay here again. The pool was fabulous!! The drinks at the pool was a little ridiculous as far as price but everything was high in Vegas. The only complaint I would have is not much to choose from in food compared to some of the other hotels. Wait time was crazy.
40,We chose this hotel for the location and things to do with the kids.  The lobby is a little dated and didn’t feel extremely clean (for example the glass doors were dirty) probably middle of the road as far as businesses and amount of people walking around. They have an active pool so we saw quite a few people in pool attire. The two bedroom suite was also a little dated which made it feel not super clean. The volcano show was really cool we also visited the pool and the hidden garden as well the kids really enjoyed those things. We dined at a few of the restaurants which were very good! We would probably try a few more hotels though before deciding to come back here since it is in need of updating.
50,Very clean. Staff was amazing. I would definitely stay here again. Location is nice as it is very accessible to many other casinos within walking distance. I love the MRewards program to earn rewards to build loyalty.
40,We booked our stay a month before they required masks again. The Mirage was great but wearing masks gambling was awful. They should consider no smoking in the casinos as the cigarette smoke stays in mask.
30,I upgraded with MLife rewards but room was hot and no one ever came after calling first day.  Staff was rude and unhelpful at pool when trying to only reserve two chairs with umbrella. So many open chairs with umbrellas the whole week and no one interested in renting one. For weekday stays that is sad.
50,My wife and I decided to try Mirage for the first and we were not disappointed. Clean throughout the property and excellent customer service from all departments. The whole place smells amazing and as far as places to eat there was a little bit of every kind of cuisine. I would 100% recommend the Mirage
40,I enjoyed the Bare Pool. I loved the $50 food credit which I purchased at a discount. The location is near the end of the strip which was okay. I Ubered to my destination and then we slowly walked back. I loved being directly across from Walgreens.
50,Amazing valet services. Quick easy and very friendly. Rooms were very clean. Only down fall was we waited on the waitress on the casino floor for over an hour for some water. When she finally came around she was like I’ll be back. Went and got my own water.
50,We consider The Mirage as our home away from home! We have been vacationing at the Mirage for the last 25yrs. and have treasured each and every vacation there. Beautiful property spacious rooms that are beautifully decorated and the customer service supplied by the staff in every department is what we have come to appreciate since they first opened their doors so many years ago.
30,The room was a good space but it was not thoroughly clean! The space between the bed and night stand was dirty and so was the bathroom under the counter and sink. We requested a thorough cleaning but just a basic was done and those areas remained the same. I was disappointed and although we had comps it left us with a bad impression.
50,This is the best experience I had and it was nice to be at a great hotel that be in the movies. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was wonderful. The sceneary was a nice site to see and I love the waterfall volcano at night.
10,Horrible experience cleaning not acceptable pillow had blood windows dirty my room smelling really bad this room was not cheap I got a volcano view with not even getting a clear view not happy at all I will not recommend
30,The Mirage Hotel and Casino is in a good location right on the Las Vegas Strip. Sadly it is starting to show it's age. Furnishings in my room need to be updated the sheer curtains need to be replaced. Need to have more outlets for computer equipment and USB ports in all of their rooms. My room was 16069. luckily I brought my own extension cord which I had to use in order to plug in the lamp on my night stand.
30,The rooms are dated old furniture worn out mattresses tub is old and needs replacing. The rooms need to be renovated. The casino is nice and open. The location is very good. The give military discounts and free parking that was nice! Top of the line 10 years ago but need to renovate those rooms
50,Outstanding experience from the second I walked into the mirage til I walked out. Staff very friendly food was excellent location on the strip very nice. Never without a drink in ur hand and the mixed drinks are awesomely poured
40,I came down for a Birthday/ Wedding and it was great times for sure! I was always happy to be back in my room at the end of the day because the view the bed and comfort level just added to my overall experience of fun and relaxation.
40,Very friendly staff here. Everyone we came in contact with were amazing. Our room was a bit outdated but we had an amazing view of the Volcano. I knocked off a star because the room we ended up in felt humid the entire time we were in there. We had trouble falling asleep cause the AC was just not working for us.
50,The Mirage lives up to its reputation. The resort and casino were very well maintained and staffed with friendly and attentive employees. The location of the resort was perfect for us it’s right in the middle of the strip.
50,First time to Vegas with the kids (13 & 11). All things considered - Covid-delta extreme heat masks - we managed a nice experience had fun and made some memories. The Mirage was outstanding. The kids loved the pool and volcano the location is great and room was very comfortable. Staff was excellent.
50,A pleasant surprise located in the heart of the Strip across from Ventian and walking distance to Cesars Harrahs LINQ Flamingo Cromwell Bellagio. Table minimums high but in line with higher end properties
50,Even though we have visited many times it is still a nice surprise the moment you walk into the Mirage. It looks so great is so clean and smells fantastic. We love the decorations the plants the water sound and the staff in all the departments seem to go above and beyond every time we visit. It is still one of our favorite places to stay. I think it is the best value priced casino!
50,The staff especially at the front desk was friendly and had good customer service. Our room was not ready at the time of check-in but we were given a complimentary $ 75.00 Food and Beverage Credit and our room was facing the strip which made the wait worthwhile.
30,Though we don’t spend much time in the rooms ours was ok (borderline poor). The bathroom had makeup smeared on the floors and shower curtain though it may have been a stain. The shower clogged and the hallway noise is loud in the rooms. Staff was friendly enough and the facilities were ok.
50,The best hotel we've ever stayed at. Bravo. We stayed at many hotels on the Strip throughout the years and the garage has definitely been the best one we've ever stayed at we will be staying there for many many many years to come thank you so much for giving us a wonderful trip
40,I usually stay at Luxor and it’s so far from all the good bars and restaurants. The mirage is close to the same price friendlier staff and way better location. You get all benefits of being close to all the luxury hotels and clubs without paying the luxury price. The mirage is my new spot for Vegas hands down.
50,All I can say the service are all excellent.. don’t have any issues like the rooms bed game table slot machines drinks restaurant everything is excellent… we don’t have to go out to eat.. the swimming pool
40,This is a good hotel. I have now stayed at almost every MGM property on the strip and this was the nicest hotel so far. It was very comfortable and clean. Great sandwiches with little wait time at Snacks restaurant. Most of the staff was very friendly. It is worth a repeat visit.
20,We were given the wrong room and told we had to move after 4hrs. We waited an extra 2hrs for the new room to be ready. Once moved the keys didn’t work and no one was available to deliver new keys. It would have been better if everything was ready the next morning.
50,My husband and I took a little trip to Vegas and were so happy with our stay at The Mirage! Great room and the pool is everything! We ate and drank by the pool and that made it even better! All of the employee’s we came in contact with were amazing.
50,The Mirage is a clean and comfortable place to stay. Las Vegas’s top spots are close by walking or Uber/Lyft. The slots and machines were clean. The Big Cats and Dolphins exhibits were cool. The Frozen Yogurt on a hot day is a bonus.
40,Great last minute trip! Room was nice though my housekeeping was skipped/missed. I did get new towels. I do miss the coffee maker in the room and can we please get rid of the honor bar? What a waste of space. Great casino and super staff! Easy check in/check out!!
20,Good strip location but don’t expect anything in the room but a bed and bath. You have to pay for almost everything. Social distance do not exist and they don’t in force anything regarding Covid-19..
50,Beautiful mirage ❤️ Will always stay here when in Las Vegas. The pool the lights the smell everything about the mirage is awesome. You won’t be disappointed if you stay here at all I promise you that :)
50,The Mirage is very nice family resort. The Pool Area was one of our favorites along with the Snacks restaurant had delicious food. We stayed in the Hospitality Suite which was 2 bedroom/3 Bathroom with a wet bar and Dining table to seat 8. It was plenty of space for our party of 7.
30,Check in was normal. Very long lines but expected in Vegas at check in. Room was the dirtiest in all the trips to Vegas I have taken. Hair on shower curtains and someone left dirty socks in the dresser. Lines at MLife and Cashier were absurd. Most of the time only 1-2 people working. Pool was amazing.
10,They did not honor the package we had booked with them. They made us pay extra instead of free upgrade for their mistake for the more expensive option. Again their fault. The room that was extra money they made us get was not cleaned like splatters stains actual garbage (I have pictures). The bed was a rock and pillows were so lumpy. I expected my reservation to be reserved and if there was a problem on the hotels end that they would make up the difference. I wonder if they'll actually refund my nearly $400 hold. I was looking so forward to this hotel. The spa was good I enjoyed the facial. The med spa definitely could use some qualified nurses who knows sanitary precautions and how to put an IV in (I work in healthcare It was a struggle to watch all the mistakes). I enjoyed the poolside and the fact that I couldn't hear children. I'm sad that there were so many issues with the room I was really looking forward to it.
30,I only come here on business. Every time room is different on a same price. This time I was overlooking the roof on a 5th floor which isn't bad since it was quicker to get downstairs. The room was a little filthy. Everything is straighten out but the perimeters of the floor furniture was covered in dust. If it was my choice I'd go to a newer cleaner hotel.
30,I can see why this hotel is rated very good and not wonderful. The clock radio on the night table did not work. The room was not vacuumed well when I checked in nor any of the days I stayed. I had a small pouch with some inexpensive earrings in my suitcase. I didn't put it in the safe (my fault). It is gone.  I originally made a reservation for 3 nights the last night a Sunday was comped. I then decided to stay for 4 nights. Again they comped the last night.  However I had to cut short my stay by one night. I asked them to give me the 3rd night comped which was their original offer. The desk clerk told me they couldn't do that because Sunday night had higher occupancy.  I asked after arguing with her to speak to a supervisor which she did.  I was then given the 3rd night comped.  My advice to anyone staying at the Mirage is speak to a supervisor if you have any trouble at checkout. Put your valuables even if not expensive in the safe. Things do get permanently borrowed.  Also make sure you hang on to your valet ticket to retrieve your vehicle. Otherwise it takes a half hour for them to retrieve your vehicle using your drivers license to look up your ticket.  One plus is the pool is one of the best at any of the hotelsbut if you want a beverage you either wait a half hour for a server to come or get it yourself at the pool area bar.
50,Stayed for 3 nights. Check in took maybe 15 minutes and there was probably 20 people ahead of us. Room was clean and had no issues. Used ice machine worked fine the whole time. We didn't hit the pool this time but I could view from my room and it wasn't overly crowded. In general I would say 90% of the amenities were open. Buffet was still closed but I can understand with the staffing shortages and the uncertainty of things being closed down in short notice due to the pandemic that it will be awhile before it reopens. The rooms are a little dated and could use a refresh but overall they are solid. We chose no housekeeping but did grab some extra towels from the cleaning staff one day. They were very friendly. Staff was very friendly in general and security was present. Mask mandates were enforced. Overall stay exceeded expectations.
20,The room was subpar there is not enough staff. Long lines for everything you try to do here. The valet does not answer the phone to get your car from your room. The beds in our room were tipping hazards the frames were broken. I would pick a different hotel with better customer service.
10,"I've been to Vegas close to 50 times and stayed at about 20 different hotels across the entire spectrum of quality. This last stay at the Mirage was hands down the worst! Service was beyond horrible. Starting prior to arrival I called the hotel with questions about my reservation and was on hold for over 90 minutes. No option for callback and no way to get a live person on the line without waiting.    Upon check-in I found NO bath towels in the bathroom...zero. Called housekeeping at 10:30pm and told they are very busy. After a total of 4 calls and nearly in tears the towels are finally brought at 1am!    After a very late first night/morning left the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door until about noon. Then left until evening returning after dinner. Room had not been turned over. Called housekeeping and apparently they had no intention of cleaning the room because the sign was on the door until noon.    Ordered some groceries from Instacart for snacks and breakfast. Asked bellman to use luggage cart to get the bags to the elevators and was told I'd have to pay $20 just to use the cart so I hauled the bags up myself.    Ordered room service which arrived in a surprisingly reasonable interval of time about 20 min but the order was wrong. The person did go back and bring the correct item.    Just a sampling of the series of unfortunate events over this 5 day trip. There are plenty of great hotels in Vegas save yourself some pain and DO NOT stay at the Mirage!"
30,MGM properties are tight used to be able to get good deals but now they’re not doing anything for you spoke to a casino host and said that I needed to play more money you get to play $200 a hand when I already play $100 a hand ridiculous no comps
30,Found a used toothbrush in my room and house keeping only cleaned my room the first day. I spoke to the front desk about it and never heard back from anyone.The first night upon arrival was awesome front desk staff was awesome loved her
50,Very nice room perfect location we really enjoyed and clean and neat!! The staff is very friendly and the house keeper doing excellent job!! When I ask for xtra blanket they provide very fast soon is I hang up phone!!
30,Everything at this hotel was great except the cleanliness of the room itself. As soon as we walked in I noticed bits of paper and things on the floor scattered about. They for sure did not vacuum. There were no bath towels only hand towels and wash clothes. There was hair all over the shower walls. I don’t know if they beds were missing comforters or if their bedding set up was just the 3 sheets on each bed.
30,Rooms were not cleaned properly had to call numerous times to housekeeping regarding missing towelsdirty pillow cases and no shampoo .items were brought up in a plastic bag and were left on top of a dresser.we felt this was so unprofessional but I hope this worker shortage will pass and things return to normal
50,Wonderful trip with my friends for my birthday. We had such a good time. The only thing we didnt like was smell grass smoke in hallway. Which was really inconvinience. I think you should put some rulls for that.  Other than than everything was good.
50,Great resort. Great Value. In need of renovation throughout the property. Showing it's age. Draining/sewage has been an issue and the sight of the roof beneath is more than an eyesore. Still an overall great hotel. Solid pool and great staff.
20,While the Mirage is an extremely well known hotel it is not that great of a stay. Spend your money on something nicer. Go visit the dolphin habitat in your leisure time. The Still was decent and accommodating but otherwise I’d steer clear.
50,The property has everything needed for an great stay. Good food and drink. Excellent gaming options. Nice ambiance with dolphins and tigers. Show options. Location on the strip allows for exploring other venues.
50,Check in process and smooth and fast staff is very professional and helpful. Easy access to hotel amenities and restaurants and the tables were hitting all night. Room service lags it sometimes but overall I had a great experience.
10,Spoke to three or four different staff members at the front desk and each one seemed annoyed with my requests for updates on when our rooms would be available (waited nearly seven hours to get into our rooms) or requests to switch rooms. There are polite ways to still provide the same information. I was also surprised to find that the rooms did not have a coffee maker or free water bottles like other hotels. Although the mini fridge was stocked with items available to purchase there was no fridge space to store your own items.
40,Great location mid-strip to other casinos and restaurants. Nice pool although the water was a bit chillier than I expected. Great breakfast at the pool. Good food at the California Kitchen and a piece of cake to die for at the Snack place! Enjoyed the dolphin and tiger Secret Garden experience. Bed was a bit soft for us but large room. Wished the room had a coffee pot and a small refrigerator for personal use.
50,If going to Vegas I recommend The Mirage. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience. The staff restaurants atmosphere were great. The pool they have is great the staff at the pool is exceptional. We definitely will be back!
10,Casino is very outdated no comps employees not trained properly everyone has a different answer to same question pitman did not record my play after giving him my players card after speaking with host told them I can provide proof of withdraw from the cashier etc … if you are in the ages 55-60 years old I would recommend this casino you can come here and just watch tv in the room and you are fine…if you are anything lower than 50 years old avoid this place everything is run down
30,Had a great weekend stay at Mirage. Only issue was we paid for a strip view room and they provided us with a overlook of the pool and claimed it was strip view because you could see the Eiffel tower from our window. This was disappointing but not anything to ruin the trip. Our bathtub had a crack in it with rust stains. I would expect this from Luxor but not the Mirage. Otherwise our stay was great and the location was enjoyable.
40,Our night at the mirage was awesome. It was my first time there and it was a great experience. Everything was perfect. The staff that helped were great they helped us with everything we need. I would definitely recommend coming here. I will booking with them again in the near future.
20,When we stayed we encountered outdated and unclean rooms. Staff was unfriendly and unaccommodating when our shower light was leaking water from the ceiling. We booked three rooms within our party and all of the rooms smelled like mildew. I would not recommend staying here.
30,The room had a leak which made the carpet wet next to the bed and we heard water trickling down inside the walls all night long. It was right next to our bed which made it really bad. And my wife got her socks wet getting into bed. However they did provide a fan and we plugged it in when we left the room. Also our carpet was buckled in the middle of the room which we tripped on a few times.
20,Rooms were dirty and overall run down. Very disappointed. There were crumbs in the floor when we arrived and only one towel in the bathroom. There were gross stains in the bathroom and the water in the shower could barely come out of the faucet. Very run down rooms need to be renovated.
30,First I was very impressed with the overall facility. The restaurants the shops and the pool were great! The staff we encountered at these places were very kind and helpful. The staff at the MLife counter were also very helpful and professional.  What we didn't appreciate at all was the overall experience in our room. The night we arrived we noticed the bathroom only had two wash clothes. My husband called housekeeping and asked for towels. He was told someone would be there shortly. After almost an hour he called again because we still hadn't received our towels and it was midnight at this point. When he called back he was placed on hold for 15 minutes before he hung up. He then called several times and he just received a recording saying they were helping others. The towel issues wasn't as bad as the condition of the bathroom. There was a fake eyelash on the counter and the shower hadn't been cleaned since the last guest used it. There was soap scum in the tub and all over the tile wall. It was quite disgusting. We had to clean the bathroom before we could even use it. We had to find a person that was cleaning rooms on our floor in the morning and ask them for towels. The whole experience was disappointing. We have stayed at a number of hotels on the strip and have never experienced anything like we did during our stay at the Mirage.
50,would recommend...went here for a dance competition event...beautiful ballroom and facilities....great pool restaurants and bars....casino not too obnoxious....really enjoyed the whole experience thanks...mirage
40,This was our 3rd stay at the mirage. Our first in the summer and first since COVID. Pros: I like the new app and the ability to use your phone for check in and the key. I paid for early check in and the room was ready as promised. The pantry was delicious as always. Long waits but I feel like they did their best. Cons: The pool was super packed and no way to get a chair without renting one or a cabana. Maybe that’s normal for the summer months but hasn’t been an issue fall/spring previously. We got a cabana one day. The poor hostess was by herself and sometimes orders took a long time. I wish there were more non smoking areas. The only area was the sports book and people were vaping there and no one seemed to care (maybe that’s ok I’m just not a fan). After checking out we checked our bags in the valet area. We waited an excessive amount of time to get our bags. Ours and the girl that checked in after us got ours after several people that came after us. The person that appeared to be in charge commented that they didn’t have enough staff to handle the large crowds. Overall a very good experience. Just allow enough time and check in to eat before you’re really hungry!
50,The Mirage is in a great location allowing easy access to everything you would need. There are plenty of options for dinning and entertainment whether you are with your family or friends. Only inconvenience would be that you are only granted elevator access to the floor your room is on so if you come with a group and are on difffloors plan accordingly
10,Horrible customer service. Bathroom pipe busted and flooded bathroom and staff non-responsive after repeated calls.    Making me fill this review with additional words that are not needed to complete……..
30,Stayed at the Mirage many times over the years. The air circulation was the only noticeable concern I had. The smell of smoke seemed not to move out of areas as quickly as other resorts visited. The pool is still amazing and the service provided everywhere was top notch.
50,Incredible location impeccable service great casino floor. I end up winning a lot of money. I can't talk about the service enough. The mirage will make sure you have what you need and your trip is exactly what you want it to be. Would highly recommend
40,The Mirage is always a super solid option on The Strip. This was our 3rd stay at Mirage and we found it to be more than adequate. We did the $20 trick at check in and we were upgraded to floor 25 with a view of the strip and the volcano!! The room was very spacious for the two of us. Only downside was a musty cigarette smell inside the room. Overall it’s clear the Mirage could go for a resort overhaul. But the location the pool and the friendly staff make up for the old hotel vibe.
30,We typically enjoy Vegas each time over the past 25 years and stay in Vegas multiple of times a year. Although considering everything that the world has gone through since 2020 it appeared MIRAGE opened prematurely in May in which we were disappointed and decided to try again in July in which it was somewhat better but not even close to the price we paid for the Penthouse Suite.
50,This is a busy place! There were two dance competitions during our stay! Lots of options for places to eat. Nice shops. Great pool area. There is always a huge line for the pool. The casino floor was always packed with guests. The rooms are large and clean. House keeping staff is very nice. The only thing I did not care for is bell service now has a $20 charge if you bring only groceries. Which I guess wouldn’t be a problem if you did your grocery shopping at the same time as check in and they took up your luggage at the same time. Also the elevator area is always packed. You may have to wait a long time to get to your room. But other than those two things (which are small complaints) the stay was awesome! We had a great time going to the Sigfrid and Roy Secret Garden too! I recommend the Mirage if you like a busier hotel.
20,Hotel services were minimal with charges for every little thing. No No No fridge or coffeemaker in room. Room was run down and very smokey on a no smoking floor. Pretty pool area and nice volcano show but anyone can watch the show without staying at the hotel. Rooms were very noisy with beeps audible in room anytime a neighboring room used room key. Hall noise very loud. Food service was non-existent late night.
50,The pool was great for cooling off. The area was very pretty we loved the waterfalls. They also have a adult only pool. There is also a dolphin pool area where you get to see the dolphins do tricks. Pretty nice.
50,I’m so glad we chose this hotel for our girls trip! It was so close to everything it worked out perfectly!! The only thing I will mention is that there is no coffee maker and no fridge to store personal items so you will have to figure those out. In addition the pool was great and clean. Make sure to go early or reserve your chair or cabana or you might be wandering around a while. Oh and don’t touch that Fiji because it’s $18. A bottle lol
50,The staff m the hotel was amazing. The housekeeping were very friendly and made sure to stop us in the hallway to make sure our room was good. We loved everything about this hotel. Even at night the volcano out front made it stand out from the rest
30,Overall the Mirage gets a solid three stars. We stayed in one of the penthouse suites and I expected more. The only thing extra is the space. The room was very nice and very spacious but that’s it - nothing extra and not even turn down service. The hotel does not give shower gel or coffee makers. Plus the view is obstructed from the screen over the windows. I’ve always stayed here but I think it is time for else to seek better accommodations. For the price of a suite there should be more amenities. They even tried to charge for late checkout!
30,See previous narrative previously written on earlier portion of this survey regard the gambling experience. That information basically covers the issues I had with this stay at the Mirage. Usually this is my hotel of choice
40,We checked in with our any issues there was rust in our tub and could tell the room needed an upgrade overall we had a good experience with the staff and the hotel was in the middle of the strip everything within walking distance.
10,Workers were unprofessional. Employee blood on floor and door of our room. A $25 voucher was supposed to buffer the issue. Additionally the voucher had the employees blood on it. Very disappointed and no longer will be staying again.
30,"Stayed during a dance competition.Kids EVERYWHERE.Las Vegas used to be an adult paradise.Now the 'family friendly"" crowd has RUINED Las Vegas.Food pricey here.Check in SLOW on a Sunday.Pool was goodtho."
50,Marisol Castillo in Retail was fabulous. I was looking for postcards to send to a friend in a memory care facility. They didn’t have any but she said they had them at their other store. Due to lack of employees they unfortunately can’t open that store. She offered to take me all the way over to the other side of the complex so I could spend $1.63 on two important post cards. That was AMAZING customer service! Thank you so much Marisol!    The housekeeping staff was friendly and helpful too!
50,Very nice and clean hotel with most everything we needed. Staff was friendly. Wish we had a fridge in our room we could actually use. If anything is touched in the fridge you get charged for it so you can take out their items and put in your own and it’s $15 extra to get your own fridge.
40,Pool hours to short no useable refrigerator in room. Restaurant was good for breakfast. Gaming not paying well but that’s vegas.  Room had view of volcano. That was cool.  Hotel was clean room was clean and good size. Do not like resort fee charged at hotel but they all do that so… over all nice stay.
50,Always feels like home. Great location and super staff. Plenty of food options and great gambling. This is our favorite MGM Resort. The pool is amazing you feel like you are in Puerto Rico. The food choices are all tasty we love the StillPantry and Costa. Its hard to beat fresh made pasta.
10,Marijuana smell in our room day and night…  Room outdated…  TV and WiFi sporadic at best…  Food/Restaurants overpriced and terrible quality food…  No shows open but that’s more corona’s fault than hotel…  Will go elsewhere next time
40,The rooms needs updating. The bathrooms are small holes in the walls and carpet is on the floor. However the hotel is in the middle of the strip (great prime location)and offers efficient pool service. There is a vast amount of restaurants with different food options. I would stay again but not at full price.
50,The Filipina lady i forgot her name but she is very professional!! And very friendly she is very good in her area she resolves my problem. I recommend this hotel 🏨 I’m very satisfied with my experience.
30,I think because I'm in Las Vegas that I'm expecting this really lavish hotel. The hotel rooms are just average. I think I get a better deal at an Hyatt or similar. I get a coffee machine a microwave and space to put my belongings in the fridge. The hotel attempts to 'trick' you into purchasing the overpriced room & fridge food items. Simply by moving them you've been charged because it is determined by weight. What happens if i bump it? Or if it falls over. The bathroom was small and you couldn't open the door w/out running into the toilet. It was just ok.
50,Staff awesome. Very clean rooms and comfortable beds. Great location! We’ve stayed here many times and love it. Great pool but only 1 restroom. Easy to order around the pool and there’s always a waitstaff ready to help.
40,My wife and I enjoyed our five night stay at the Mirage. Yes the rooms need an upgrade as the carpet and furniture is a bit worn but our Resort room on the 24th floor was clean and had fantastic views of the Strip and mountains. From check in to check out every staff member we came across was very friendly and attentive. Some of the restaurants still are not open daily but hopefully that will change soon. California Pizza Kitchen was excellent as always. The Pantry was great for breakfast. Monday night our last night we ate at Heritage Steak. We didn’t have a reservation so we ate at the bar and the service was fantastic. The Prime Rib with Yorkshire pudding was excellent. We reserved an umbrella and chair at the Oasis pool and it was well worth it. Good selection of music and not too loud at all. Thank you to all the Bartenders and service staff  and special thank you to Cindy and Will who when we had a couple of minor bill issues promptly took care of them for us. Hopefully MGM renovates soon as we will definitely stay again.
50,Spent 5 nights at the Mirage staff was very friendly from check-in to the pool area and throughout the property. Room was clean and had a great view of the strip and the pool area. Breakfast at the Pantry was delicious recommend the smashed potatoes and Pops pancakes. Overall great experience staying at the Mirage.
50,A family of 28! Yes you read that right!! All 28 of us stayed here for 2 nights as the first leg of our Vegas/Grand Canyon trip. Check in was a breeze and Check out was even easier. Very beautiful hotel. Clean and accommodating. We loved that the fireworks were right above our hotel on the 4th of July. We literally watched the show from the window of our room. The only issue we had was that everyone was complaining about having to scan their key card when they got in the elevator. Especially my 81 yr old dad who was on a scooter and my 77 yr old mom who was trying to hold the door with her purse and luggage and trying to help my dad all at the same time. They were very confused as to why the elevator would not just let you push the button and take them to their room. So I would advise you if you are elderly and not savvy with technology to avoid this hotel. Other than that we enjoyed our stay. Would stay again. The Volcano show was a huge hit for the young and old alike! Very cool!
50,From the check in to the servers at the machines to the cleaning crew. Very friendly and helpful. We spent three days there for my fiancé birthday. We were always greeted with a smile. The staff never hesitated to answer any questions.
10,Do yourself a favor spend the extra few bucks and have a more memorable stay in Vegas. The Mirage facilities were absolutely terrible-the hip hop music played at the pool was appalling. The app to open the room door never did work. The staff told us their pay was 10 days late so a lot of people were quitting.
40,The room was high-quality and exceptionally clean. Very quiet even when overlooking the Volcano. The shower was a bit retro but it got the job done. If you book a room ask for a room near the elevators -- the hallways are quite long. The view of three Strip was great day and night.
50,My solo trip at The Mirage was very nice. Only complaints were the rooms were not as quiet as expected. Could hear people talking outside as if they were in the room. Also experienced mini fridge had items missing before entering room. Hoping the previous guest we’re charged for it and not me during my stay.
40,We enjoyed our stay and will be staying at the mirage again in the future. Loved that we could order food to the room. I wish more places inside the hotel would offer it.  A few 1st world issues with the room that can be improved but overall very pleased!!
50,Could not have been any more pleased with our 5 day stay!!! The most clean and friendly/fun Hotel I’ve ever stayed in!!! This Hotel also has a fabulous location on the strip!!! Entertainment surrounds you with a intense plethora of food and fun and adventure!!! Do yourself a favor and stay here!!
50,Restaurants- Eateries- Pool- Layout-Noise level- Air condition level-the parking was great. The hotel elevators and the hotel layout. Easy to maneuver and the larger swimming and seating was very good
10,I was very excited to stay at the mirage with my family. I’ve been to several hotels in Vegas and this was by far the worst experience. I talked this location up to my family who had never seen Vegas before and they couldn’t wait to get out of there! Horrible checkin with a rude staff member didn’t receive rooms requested and parking/drinks were completely overpriced! Completely not satisfied.
30,Mirage Hotel is at a great location on the strip. Very centrally located. Easy to get around. The hotel is in need of an update. It is very dated and the rooms are very small and the bathrooms are tiny.
50,Went with friends and family had a great time went to Cesar palace and watched Usher we also flew for the first time was really nice we stayed seven days the rooms were great the hotel was great would go back again
50,We enjoyed every minute of our stay. We checked in early and our room was ready on the app. Download the app it’s the best. Our room was perfect. A little old but for families it’s all you need. Pool was great but very expensive. We will go again.
50,Going to win it all back next time and then some place was clean and everyone was polite. Dianna at the m life window is amazing we saw lots of jackpots hit every night and also the snack restaurant is a must
50,Awesome pool to celebrate our son’s birthday. It wasn’t too crowded. Kids enjoyed playing in the pool. Poolside food & drinks. Clean rooms. Friendly staff. Great short getaway. Thank you for the memories.
50,I recently traveled to Las Vegas July 23rd through 25th of 2021. Parking is shaded and there was plenty. Upon entry to the Mirage the premises was nice and clean. I used Mobil check in which made getting to my room quick and easy. Staff at the Mirage were kind and helpful. Overall my stay was a 10/10.
50,Check in was flawless our room was ready early. Self serve kiosk for the room keys is great with no waiting in the check in line. Good location on the strip. Room was clean and nice. Bed and pillows very comfy.
10,I entered my room the first day. It smelled funny but I was excited to be in Vegas so I left it alone. I received a call while I was away that my room was leaking. Moved to another room that was leaking.
30,The room had ripped chair the bathroom had broken/missing glass shelf the minibar had missing items obnoxious people running up & down hall at 3/4 am and the resort fee is a joke. We NEVER used the gym the phone the printer for plane tickets or the wifi. Those are out dated BS charges that I'm disputing through cc now. Staff wasn't friendly & had way better service at every other hotel/casino we went to. Will definitely be going to different hotel on our next visit.
30,I like the Mirage hotel overall this time I had an extremely bad experience with their customer service staff. I stayed at the Mirage before covid shut everything down and had a wonderful time. It's sad
10,I will not recommend any one to stay there.  People were smoking weed everywhere I think if people want to smoke weed there should be a designated area for that.  The room when we cked in had no towels the bathroom fan was extremely loud the handle for the shower head was loos so it was hard to control the temperature of the water. The drink cups had no cover (they ran out) when sitting in the pool water got inside the drinks every time someone splashed water. Water leaks in the lobby when it was raining
50,This was our first time there. My daughter and I enjoyed the awesome pool. The room with queen beds was nice comfy and clean in our opinion. The staff was courteous and helpful. And the Secret Garden was an AMAZING experience!!! Thank you Mirage! We will be back soon.
50,Random quick visit was awesome I fully enjoyed the cabana and pool service. Cabana came stocked with snacks and drinks too it off the bottle service was on point.The staff was friendly and just made stay awesome!!
30,Buffets are closed. No drink staff on casino floor. Machines are very tight. few options for gaming tables. Drinks and restaurants are way overpriced. Room was nice. Bathroom showing age. Could not adjust water pressure. Poor experience compared to prior stays.
50,Great place to stay! No issue al all!  Great location clean rooms nice pool a good size gym a lot of restaurants to pick from and a lot of things to do inside the hotel! I will for sure come back soon
40,This is a great place to go relax and just be you. It can get crowded but I think it is because it is such a great place. The pool and displays are gorgeous! You feel like you are at a Hawaiian resort
20,check in was hrs (even beibg an Mlife memebr and using mobile app. Staff was very unfriendly. No apoligy for the mix up/the wait/the going to the room but it was not ready. And dont expect a drink of water while you wait.
10,Checking-in took almost 1 hr long with 3 families in front of me. When it was my turn 6 families were also waiting and irritated. Bathroom disgusting. Bubbles up and splashes all over the floor. Bathroom space nonexistent only enough for 1 person.
50,We have traveled to Vegas several times without our kids. Both came with us this year and had a great time. The stay at the Mirage was awesome. The room pool restaurants were all excellent and enjoyed by all.
10,Awful Platinum checkin 2 people working I'm only one in line. One leaves me standing there closes and goes home. Had to wait 20 min being only one in line. This had come very well recommended and was terrible!
40,My overall experience was great. Definitely would return in another occasion. The Still restaurant at the Mirage was definitely a place I'd recommend to anyone. Food service and pricing I'd say were great.
50,The entire trip was amazing. The room was good close to everything good options for things to do in the hotel. El Diablo was Fantastic. The theater staff was great. The only downside to our trip was the Italian restaurant that we went to inside the Mirage. The hostesses were not friendly the staff put us in a back corner by the prep station for the wait staff(even though there was better tables and we had a reservation) our waiter ignored us for a good 10 minutes and then tried to rush us out as quickly as possible. The food was 50 50 for us. The pizza was done well. The calamari was salty and the Chicken parm was overcooked. The mark down is for the Costa
50,It was very nice place the slot machines I love them people there it’s so nice the place is A plus and the water show with fire it’s incredible Igor so much fun I’m coming back next month so The Mirage hotel wait for me again thanks
40,Mirage is in the middle of the strip. Great location. Beautiful grounds. The room is a little dated now. Stains on the chairs carpet worn.  The room was clean however. Like everywhere in the country now lines are long and the restaurants and checkin at the Mirage are no exception.
50,The Mirage is the Best Casino with the Best Staff in Vegas! We've stayed at them all too: Luxor Venetian Bellagio Wynn...The Mirage just blew us away at their genuine love for their guests and their willingness to go above and beyond the call of duty to ensure our stay was awesome. We will be back very soon!
30,No coffee in room small bathrooms no extra blankets in room closet poor charging outlets no outlet by bedside table everything $$$$. I have stayed here x2 in the past but 20 years ago and doesn’t seem like any updates to rooms or casino
50,My girlfriends and I stayed at mirage and absolutely loved it. The pool area was our favorite by far! The drinks were pricey but delicious. I was surprised they allowed coffee and two drinks into pool area. Usually at resorts your trying to sneak it in but not here. I thought that was a cool option for those that couldn’t afford the high priced drinks. The casino was small compared to others but I enjoyed the games I played and came home a winner. The air was clean and did not smell like weed which is why I picked this property. It is convenient to lots of places to eat and drink which was awesome. Book now!
40,We picked this hotel because we thought that the siegfried and roy exhibit would be nice. However we would like to recommend you replace the shower head it was terrible. The rest of the room was okay the safe could be a little larger.
50,Great location and convenient layout. The location of the parking garage to the lobby is great. Fairly easy walk from lobby through the casino to rooms. Nice selection of restaurants. Love the pool Secret Garden and show rooms.
40,Getaway for a birthday okay room with great staff. Convenient for the activities we planned. Pool and Secret Garden were amazing! Really enjoyed the pool side service! The dolphin show was very entertaining!
20,When we checked into our room it was musty smelling and outdated. The waters above the mini bar were opened the nuts opened and a technology pack that all cost $ were open. Pretty gross! We called the front desk and got 2 nights resort fees credited. We paid $90 per person for the adult only pool. It was not worth the money. No music. It would have been better to be at the normal pool or go to another pool that has a party.
50,Although it was jam packed we had an amazing time! The staff was great and the food was amazing! We made reservations in advanced which really helped. The weather was hot but tolerable. We won some and enjoyed the shows.
20,"There were pubic hairs in the bath tub upon arrival. Rust in tub as well. Room smelled musty. The staff was very respectful and attempted to remedy this. I was not able to move rooms as there was no vacancy. However the staff did reclean the bathroom. I was told that there would be a $50 credit to room charges but at check out I had to ask for it which felt awkward. My friend's room had open and eaten items from the ""stocked"" snacks and bar. When they complained two days of resort fees were compt. I kind of felt like finding pubic hairs in the tub was maybe more of gross feeling. In addition when I brought the issue to the concierge attention she was super nice but asked what I wanted to do about it rather than just handling it and telling how you (the resort) would rectify it. The whole thing seemed put back on me the customer instead of the company making me feel taken care of."
10,Very Rude MLife Staff not accommodating. Dated room carpet did not appear to be vacuumed and rust was on tub drain and tub. I do not recommend eating at the Pantry poor service took getting a manager and another customer pointing out we had not been waited on.
10,As we entered our room the smell of smoke was in the air. Walked over to see our view and our carpet was wet. Went to shower before heading out to a show realize no towels in the room. Got moved to a different room but wasn’t much better.
10,I will not be staying there the rooms weren’t clean and the room smelled like mildew. The digital key did not work at all. There is no fridge to use at all since the room is stocked up with drinks they filled with in the mini fridge.
10,Window drapes were torn and the mattress was badly worn… shifted to one side. Everything in the room was just old & tired. Security officers were great; they helped to retrieve my misplaced cell phone. There is an overall lack of security in the casino however. Broken door at the entrance & dingy carpeting. MLife staff not helpful at all.
10,The pool manager is completely incompetent and should be fired. She ruined our entire family vacation with some false accusations. Would never stay here again. The location is OK but the rooms are honestly dirty and outdated.
50,Extremely friendly very polite rooms were great casino was fully open! Doing amazing job fresh out of the pandemic!! Room service and restaurants were as delicious as always! Highly recommend this hotel!
50,We had a great time at the mirage. Casino is too notch. Amenities pool location everything was just perfect. We had a corner king room. Very clean. The bath tub was so tiny and the air conditioner didn’t get as cold as we like but those are very minor things. Overall we would definitely stay here again and plan to!
50,Hands free check in was a cinch. Loved the phone key idea. Great location with nice restaurants that didn’t break the bank. Very nice looking pool. Nice size room for a single with king bed. Great housekeeping.
20,Rooms were hot and smelled like mildew and cigarettes. I would recommend based on how much I spent. I would stick with cheaper mgm properties. Like Luxor mgm grand mandalas bay etc. they are cheaper and nicer rooms!
30,Need a new renovation. Rooms looked rundown and they were warm even turning the thermostat at it’s lowest setting. The view out the window premiered a dirty towel and trash on the roof. The cleaning staff was pleasant and observant.
20,We had serval issues with the cleanliness of our hotel room. We asked to be moved twice. The first room had a dirty tub. The carpet looked like it had not been vacuumed. The furniture in the room were stained and in bad condition. The ceiling had black stains that perhaps indicated water damage. The second room had stained bedsheets and pillowcases. There was also mold growing in several areas of our room the smell was so overwhelming that we could not make it work and asked for our room to be changed. Of course this took all day to be resolved. We wasted our entire first afternoon in Vegas trying to get a decent room to sleep in. What a waste. We took pictures that we plan to upload. Please beware if you are a person that suffers from allergies or asthma this is surely to trigger it!
50,Nice hotel with spacious rooms and casino is clean. Loved that they played 80's music through the hotel and pool area. Hotel seemed busy for a mid week stay. Starbucks and the Coffee Bean were.busy before 9Am. Also get to the pool early and the chairs sill up fast. If your budget allows highly recommend upgrading to the green lounge chairs with small table Umbrella and waitress service. Made for a very relaxing day.
40,nice room and nice prices! good discounts! the showerhead needed updating & the drain was clogged! the bed and pillows were awesome!! slept well! good checkin online! great pool and hot tub! snacks restaurant was reasonable price!
40,This was my 3rd stay at the Mirage but it has been 3 years since the last one. The pool is great. Plenty of chairs plenty of space but a fun atmosphere with great drinks. The rooms on the other hand seemed to have gone down a bit. Our room smelt a little funny and one of the drawers of the dresser were broken. The bathroom was very small as well. The bed was comfortable. I recommend the hotel if you are there for the pool and will be out and about almost of the time. The location is ok as well a bit north on the strip from where most of the action is. The main reason I personally will not return most likely is the clientele is much younger and a bit wilder. So many people up at all hours yelling and talking loudly in the hallway. Not very relaxing at all when you are constantly being woken up.
30,Staff training needed. Your staff seemed on edge and snappy. When I asked questions about locations and restaurant hours they seemed to really enjoy just pointing to restaurant or location signs. This happened to me in three different occasions! Then I go to Bellagio Cesars Palace or Venetian and attitudes are very different. Good luck….(a former guest)
20,Stay away from Las Vegas until pandemic is over. Almost 98% of people don’t wear mask and no social distancing. This place is like a Petri dish of the virus. It seems like another planet where people has no knowledge of the ongoing pandemic.
20,Room was so old and outdated Bathroom is terrible with chipped paint and bathroom faucet was so loose and would fall out. Door did not close properly and there was so many layers of paint! Room is the opposite of what you see outside.
50,This is my 5th time staying at this property. Always had a great time. Location is fantastic and I love the pool. Just make sure you get there early as pool chairs go quickly. Looking forward to a trip in the fall.
50,We had a great time. The staff are nice and helpful! They actually care. There were a few times that we ended up “looking lost” ;) and the staff were very friendly and actually walked us to the starbucks which is why we probably needed it >_<
10,1) Dirty towels on toilet when we entered the room. Seemed like someone did not complete house keeping  2) No clean towels  3) Hotel was practically empty but we were given a room facing away from the strip. Not sure why.    Overall would not recommend anyone to come here.
30,Good location. Average casino at best. Customer service needs to be inmproved. Very slow check in. Enjoyed stay for the most part. Did see bugs in room but room was clean and bed was very comfortable.
50,We checked in on a Friday morning. The checkin staff was very helpful. We arrived at 7am and our room was not ready but the check in clerk a key to the pool to relax and helped speed up the room process. The overall experience was perfect!
50,Other than weather (Vegas monsoon in July!) that had higher than usual humidity and some rain that affected flights in and out of airport but had a great time. Location was near the new Resorts World (it had a slot area about the size of a football field) monorail and bus stops (we didn't take bus in favor of monorail due to heat). They have a tram that runs between Mirage and Treasure Island (limited hours) that saved some walking. Shin Lim show was great as always (seen him 4 or 5 times and each show was great). Buffet was closed (opens end of August) and Snacks otherwise eating places were open.
50,I was a so surprised by how much we enjoyed our stay at The Mirage. We found the hotel very age appropriate for us 50 yr olds. The music played throughout is 70s and 80s there is a variety of restaurants for everyone’s taste and the pool area is a relaxing paradise.
50,First time staying at the mirage it was great  staff was friendly has a lot of convieneny stores inside and pool is great ! Staff was friendly as well  And my room was a suite and it was amazing ! Will definitely return .
40,Last Day our bathroom was leaking through the exhaust fan. No use of bathroom for fear of getting shocked. Engineering never showed. Went home showerless. Had to take elevator down 6 floors to use casino bathroom. The rest of the stay provided a great 40th anniversary get away.
30,Hotel rooms are clean and beds very comfortable but if you eat at restaurants located on ground floor be ready to deal with long wait times to get in long wait times for waiters to attend you and wait even longer to get your food!
40,Stayed at the Mirage during a business trip to Vegas the Casino staff and F&B experience was great during the stay property was very clean and location is awesome. The rooms were okay average for the properties in that area of the strip but the value overall made up for any short comings.
20,Our items from our room came up  Missing and the manager lied to us that they had our stuff and they didn’t and tried to compensate us (3 people)with &75 which is nothing. The food is overpriced so we had to add to it so we could eat a burger runs about $20.00
30,The check in experience was horrific. The app never truly functioned as a digital key. The workout room is also severely lacking. Overall it was a decent stay though. There were several good food and bar options and the sports book wasn't too shabby.
40,good location. tram to tropicana located on site. monorail access to other hotels and casinos is across street. App required to access several on site restaurants-not good if you don't have the app to scan to make reservation. there is a denny's mcdonald's and outback steakhouse across the street with easy access. rooms were nothing special-we stayed in king volcano view-dusty lamps and other areas so can't say the sanitizing is great with covid going on. staff was pleasant and efficient for most part. arrived early a.m. and room was available which was very nice.
20,We brought our daughters to experience Las Vegas for their 21st birthday. We reserved two penthouse suites for 7 days. After checking in Our daughters could not get into their suite due to a malfunction with the key card. We requested assistance but when a representative was sent to assist they were ignored. The hotel representative passed by them several times until one of our daughters asked if she was looking for them. The representative replied “…no I’m looking for someone needing a new key for a suite. My daughters were insulted and upset by this comment. They were made to feel that they had no place in the penthouse and weren’t welcome there. Both suites had water issues. The water pressure was very low and at times we had no water at all. The sinks had slow drainage and would clog up. The doors to the bedrooms would not stay open. However there were door stops there to “resolve” the issue. The nightstand drawers would not stay closed and I injured myself multiple times on them. Housekeeping almost nonexistent. Bedding with stains were left on the bed and several requests had to be made to get clean bedding. Trash and bags of food were left in the room for days at a time. We ended up placing it outside the doors. There was not a microwave nor were there any complimentary snacks. This is not what we expected from an MGM hotel especially as penthouse guest. Noise from the strip neighboring guest rooms and the halls kept us awake. Highly disappointed.
10,Rooms are old and smell like mildew there’s rust in the bathtub our room was not clean on our last night cause they had too many check outs. At the restaurant for breakfast they too 50 minutes for our meal to arrive.
40,Mirage is a very nice hotel and casino with tons of amenities. I’ve had great experience with the staff and the room is spacious and clean.    Downside is the bathroom felt small. I feel like the food options were limited. There needs to be a 24 hour food option. CPK needs to open up again.
10,Staff is rude and doesn’t care about comfort or satisfaction. Would have received better service from a regular hotel and I expect more from a resort. Our AC broke no fan or anything available- just told to stay in hot room until the next day.
40,Bar staff was rude and short when placing an order.Room was clean and staff over all was great. Front desk staff very fast and respectful. Cage staff was helpful but not very polite. We will be back to the Mirage
40,Mirage is on the strip and room had good view of pool  good deal for tacos and margaritas on Tuesday night bottomless tacos and margarita for $30 . Can take tram to treasure island  and great breakfast place hash ago ago walking distance
40,Great hotel and great location too. Center of the strip with lots of options to eat. Pool was amazing with plenty of seating. Overall great experience and service and would definitely come back again.
10,Booked a suite paid $500/night with no microwave/no coffee maker and the non working jacuzzi. I originally booked 2 bedrooms suit with 1 king bed and 2 queen beds. But I end up with one bed in each room due to availability. I was not aware of the availability. I thought I suppose to get what I reserved and paid for.
20,Think the title pretty much sums it up.  Also double think getting the volcano view room unless you like flood lights shining in your window all night.  Also ask them if you can use the in room refrigerator.  Ours was stocked and locked. Could only open if we wanted to buy their stuff.  Had to go buy a cooler so we could have cold drinks in our room.  And yes I did win some money while I was there. Not just giving a so-so review because I lost money.
40,The Mirage was a great place to stay. I personally love MGM Hotels. The Casino was clean as well as the hotel. the ambiance was amazing. After 5pm the casino was very live! I didn't get a chance to eat at any go the restaurants because they stayed full. I enjoyed the view from my room.
50,I love getting away and the Mirage never fails. I always have a safe clean and enjoyable stay. I would recommend this hotel and casino to any of my family and friends. The ability to get digital keys and self check-in keeps the wait time down.
30,Room smelt old and is outdated. They do not provide free parking unless you’ve been an M-life reward member for a while. They have a $15 daily rate to use their parking. We did liked that it was close to everything. The line to check in is long so download their app it saves you a lot of time. I was able to check in using it and print my keys in the self-check in designated area.
30,Not enough housekeepers to clean daily also no In room coffee makers. Extremely frustrating to have to get dress and go down 22 stories just to get a cup of coffee in the morning. Room service coffee was going to be 45 min to 1 hour. The line downstairs had at least 30 people. If you like to wake up with Folgers in your cup you can forget it here!
40,Easy check in and check out super smooth. Nice property clean rooms and comfortable beds. Easy walk to Caesar's and Venetian and cabs are cheap to the airport. Volcano show is cool and sports book is solid.
50,Awesome hotel to stay at. Food options were great. We absolutely loved Diablo's Cantina it is a must try. Hotel Staff is friendly. The hotel is well taken care of and clean. We've stayed at numerous hotels on the Strip and we have found that The Mirage just has a great feel about it. We absolutely love it.
50,We took our teenagers here and they had a blast. The pool was great the volcano was impressive and the location on the strip was great for sightseeing and visiting all of the restaurants. The room was very impressive as well.
50,This trip should have happened March 17 2020 for our youngest's 21st birthday. Going July 2021 was important and special. We had the best cabana time massages by the pool steak dinner amazing rooms and very good service from many staff members.
10,My fiance and I were awoken on our first morning here by housekeeping standing directly outside our door showing each other videos on their phones and just laughed when I opened the door no apology. They then proceeded to yell down the hall at each other to the point where I had to call the front desk. In the middle of the day this *might* be more acceptable but to wake your guests up this way is not. This experience also came on the tail end of another bad experience here where the staff had discriminated against me but that is already reflected fully in another review. Unfortunately this hotel is not what it used to be as far as staff goes. I would not recommend it to anyone who is bothered by poor customer service or looking for a quieter night sleep.
50,All around great service from the staff and guest services. Check in was fast and easy alll from my mobile device . Taxi service was quick and got me to where I needed to be. And every restraunt in the hotel was delicious.
40,Birthday celebration for first time Vegas visitor. Had a good time lots of things are open some not. Wait for meals can be long. Lots to see and do right from the hotel. Easy to catch a cab or Uber also.
40,First time at mirage. Check in was quick and easy on phone. Held our bags until our early check in was ready and key is on phone. Location and hotel were awesome. Room was not clean though. Floors dirty and old jewelry still there. Broken glass on floor. Feet will turn black from room floor. Reward points for mgm properties not explained well so we gambled else where. Overall was good experience but probably stay somewhere else when we go again next year.
30,Enjoy the hotel and the variety of games offered but unfortunately the poker room which one stood as the center of the poker universe is now nonexistent. First they made it smaller and then they closed it entirely and filled it up with slot machines. Slot machines don’t complain show up every day and are much cheaper then poker rooms  Also insider tip if you want a chair at the pool you better get down there at 9 o’clock because it fills up fast
50,Mirage is perfectly located and is a beautiful hotel to stay at. We enjoyed our time at the pool and seeing the dolphins and tigers and lions. Room are great slept wonderful the bed and pillows very comfy
40,I was on the 23rd floor with a fabulous view. The bathroom was basic and the expensive snacks and drinks were nicely stocked. The only thing wrong was there was no mini fridge or microwave in the room.
50,Great location. You can walk to many different attractions including the ferris wheel. Large pool area. My room was clean. Restaurants were very good. Wish the Buffet would have been open. Staff was very friendly
50,The whole experience was great! The staff was super helpful with directions. The rooms were nice and clean. The beds were super comfy. Traveled with family and everyone enjoyed there stay. Great selection of restaurants within the hotel.
10,There was like 4 places to eat in there. Other resorts had over a dozen it appeared. The stuff that was available was so overpriced. A basic breakfast for two cost over $60. Dinner was easily over a $100 for two. They charge $26 per night for parking. $26 per night!!!!
50,Very nice stay. Cleanliness inside and outside of the resort was exceptional. Amities and location was great! Staff was awesome.  Price increases were a bit shocking but this was throughout Vegas. Thank you
30,Not a lot of choice of restaurants after midnight.. very expensive .. check- in is a long wait .. was not told I needed a deposit for every night .. on my free promotion .. hard to charge to my to my room …
20,I have stayed here many times and all went well but not this time. The A/C in our room had to be repaired three times. The faucet in the tub would not stay on the wall. The lights in the bathroom went out The safe broke and took two different service people to repair it The toilet paper holder would not stay in place. They seemed so short handed in all the food establishments    What was good I loved the pool and the staff are friendly. I
30,I booked a wheelchair accessible and non-smoking room 1 month in advance. The day of my stay I did a pre check-in at 10:30 am. I was told I will receive a text message when my room is ready. 3 pm and I never got a message back. Went to the hotel lobby to find out they gave my room away. They found a room for me but to find out the room had a strong odor smell of marijuana. I had both my sons and wife with me. I wasn't going to have them stay in a room that had a strong marijuana odor. Went back to the front desk and they downgrade my room to a non wheelchair accessible & that room wasn't going to be available until 6 pm. We checked into our room and I wasn't able to take no show nor my wheelchair wasn't able to go into the bathroom. The wife & I went downstair to play some slot. We then decided to call it a night and went to our room to find out our room key wasn't working. We went downstair to the hotel lobby and waited 2 hours in line because there was only 2 staff working at the time. They re made our room key and pretty much we didn't have enough time to rest and sleep since our check out time was at 11am. Overall the hotel is nice just that we had a bad experience from the start.
50,Highly recommend for family gatherings! The hotel is kept very clean and there is something for all to enjoy. The pool is extremely large and sparkling clean. The casino is well spaced out. Very fun and definitely a place I would go back
50,We stayed four nights mid-July 2021 at the Mirage Resort two-queen beds room for $400 which we booked in May. Our room was on the 8th floor near the elevator clean nice view of the pool and a portion of the strip. The bathroom was small with one sink and you had to get off the toilet before you could open all the way the bathroom door. We felt safe though less than half of the people in the hotel and casino were wearing a mask - we wore masks. We rented a pool cabana and lived in luxury for the rest of the day (10am to 6pm); the pool waterfall was the highlight of our pool experience. Indoor dining is not user-friendly; check in with the maitre D' for instructions on getting a table; otherwise you could be wasting your time in line. Overall the staff was friendly courteous accommodating our needs and respectful of our wants except for one craps dealer. He was offensively impolite arrogant old man unpleasant and disagreeable with many of us players at the craps table. My small group of five left and went to Cromwell casino to play craps for the rest of the evening.
30,The Mirage used to be a great place but now it seems dated and old. We don't plan on staying there again. For the money we paid we expected something special and got only average. It might help if they updated it.
50,The check-in and check-out process was easy and the staff are super friendly. I only wish they would let you go into the bare pool club if you are staying at the hotel but other than that the hotel is great.
30,Hotel is beautiful staff very friendly but seem overwhelmed. Cleaning staff is lazy - my bathroom was dusty and the floor never was mopped. Check- in was a nightmare- had to wait 6 hours for my room
40,Loved the location and that you can park in any Mgm properties. Room was clean customer service was exceptional. The only con to this resort is lack of food locations inside this resort. Lines were extremely long for what they did have. I was attending a conference with only an hour lunch break each day. I had to use DoorDash so that I could actually eat lunch.
10,This was the worst place I have stayed in Las Vegas. Most of the Bars and Restaurants were closed and the few that were remaining were so badly managed that our service was horrible. We eventfully went across the street to the Venetian for our meals. We were there for the ISS SHOW and will not return if it remains at the Mirage.
50,My stay was great overall. I had a small problem that was promptly handled. It could use some more vending and ice down the hallways. It is a very long walk from the very end of the hallway back to the middle hub to get ice or a bottle of water.
20,Was very upset. Told before hand mini bar was sensitive and would be charged even if i didnt eat food. I have 3 kids who touch everything. Room service food was expensive and cold. They even forgot one of my items
10,Room was not thoroughly cleaned between guests. We requested housekeeping service the room and left for several hours and returned to find the bed had been taken apart and left that way. Had to wait nearly 2 hours for housekeeping to come finish the bed. The following day we left the sign on the door that we did not want service but returned to find they disregarded the sign and entered the room anyway. Never did vacuum the floor as requested. Crumbs/debris from previous guests remained on the floor for the duration of our stay. Beyond that furniture has serious wear on top of being outdated. We tried to upgrade but we're told nothing was available. First guest services person was very friendly and helpful subsequent staff not so much. Honesty felt incredibly disrespected by housekeeping and the condescending attitudes of the 2 guest services personnel. I feel as though we were treated this way because of our booking. Comp room = not a valued guest. At least I didn't pay for this experience. I will not be likely to book again. This was a hotel being considered for us and our wedding party to stay in November. Now I will definitely be letting our friends and family know to AVOID Mirage.
50,Very nice relaxed casino. A little far to walk to o her casinos in there summer heat but wouldnt be an issue in cooler temps. Staff was helpful friendly and fast with requested services. Would definitely stay again.
10,Room dirty and reeked of smoke. Rust on floor and in tub didn’t feel like filtration was working . Restaurants were never open hard to eat for conference… lines too long. It was hard to find place during day at all. No coffee pots in room.
10,Customer service not accommodating the check and staff not accommodating the casino is very old and not up-to-date and we were not able to get the room they were promised for a check in because we checked in at 10:30 due to traffic
50,We got married in Vegas and had the opportunity to stay in Villa 9. Unbelievable service food and people. The entire group was one of a kind. I know its supposedly their job but they went above and beyond. They were more like friends.
20,The room was dirty. I had Luke warm to cold water via the shower the whole week. No coffee maker in the room and could not put water in the refrigerator as it was stocked full with mini bar items that cost a small fortune. The internet was very limited if it worked at all. The television was so old that we could not stream our own Netflix probably couldn’t have with the slow internet anyway. It seemed like the only channels on the TV were sports. The AC in the room was terrible in the 112 degree weather. The lines at check in were long and the service receive was poor. The was a very unpleasant stay. If I decide to come back to Vegas I will find another place to stay.
40,Great place to stay because of its location and friendly staff. Lots of history there too! Everything was well taken care of but feel bad for the overworked kitchen staff. That caused a few delays but they did everything they could to make up for it! Otherwise fantastic place to stay with your going as a couple or with a group of friends!
10,Won’t stay here again. Fridge was broken. Shower drain was clogged. Trash behind the night stand and both beds from whoever stayed here god knows when. Floor is filthy carpet has never been cleaned. Just layers and layers of dust and dirt on every corner. Vile.
40,Great location on the strip! Took the family for a fun weekend. Pool was a absolute blast. Shows and food at the mirage was amazing. A bit pricing for a small room. Food was amazing but not on par with the prices.
40,We typically stay across the road but due to a car rental return the Mirage was convenient. This was a nice change. The pool was great in 100 degree heat. There were many people using it but it was large  Enough if didn’t feel over crowded. The room was a nice size. The only complaint is the shower pressure seemed to be like needles but a good way to encourage a quick shower. Shower curtains were a plus over the last property we stay in. We did miss having quick access to the monorail but it was across the road and through the hotel we usually stay at so this is not a terrible distance unless walking is not for you. If the price is close to usual hotel next trip we will choose this location instead!
30,This was our first time visiting Las Vegas. We chose The Mirage based on price location and reviews. Going into this I was not expecting an over the top experience.  Onto my my first point if you are expecting over the top 5* beautiful modern hotel this is not it and you will be disappointed. Both me and my husband agreed this hotel is sufficient to sleep shower and be close to everything but literally nothing more than that. The overall vibe is dated. Mirage has seen better days.    The Good Stuff:  Location Location Location. We were across from Venetian Wynn Harrahs and next to Caesars. Directly across from Mcdonalds Panda Express Chipolte and Walgreens.  The pool was great. At first its a bit overwhelming to see so many people but once you get a spot its pretty chill. We got to the pool everyday around 1-1:30PM and never had an issue getting a chair.  The App to check in/out was great. We walked by the desk many times and the lines were long and slow. We were thankful that we did not have to deal with any of that.  Housekeepers were great. Very friendly. Always had a nice attitude and greeted us in the hallway.  You could only use the elevators with a room key for safety. It was definitely good to know that not just anyone could access the rooms.  Gambling was ok. I did tables and slots. Not the place where I lost the most money :)    The Bad Stuff:  Rooms and hallways are dated. Had a musty/dust odor. Our room was adequate but major complaint is the A/C. we had it on the lowest possible temp and we were still hot. We found the hallway to be colder. None of the USB chargers worked. The toilet didn't flush all the way. The shower pressure felt like chards of glass being thrown at your skin. Again if you are just looking to sleep and shower then the room is fine.  Drink Prices are outrageous. Bucket of 6 budlights 1 really large Pina Colada = 85.00 without tip. I will say however I enjoyed the Pina Colada it was very good.  Gym was a joke. Hours were 8-5PM only. Super small for a hotel of this size. Always crowded. Ok equipment if you don't have to wait to use it. I have migraines and a trigger for me is heavy scents. Whatever they deodorized the gym carpets with was super strong and almost always gave me a headache.  Be prepared to wait EVERYWHERE. No joke 30 min wait for a grande ice coffee at starbucks. Not a fancy coffee drink a regular old ice coffee. I thought my husband was going to lose it. LOL. I skipped coffee one day because I didn't want to wait. Also at one point there was a line to get on the elevators to get to your room. I was mind boggled. M life Rewards there was always a line. Just be prepared for lines.    Tips:  Bring a cooler of some sort. We brought a soft cooler that holds 24 bud light cans. Cost me 20 bucks. We wanted cold drinks in the room and this was great considering you have NO FRIDGE IN THE ROOM. We filled with ice about once per day and it worked great.  If you go during summer hot months don't be a tough guy or cheap and walk or sightsee. Just take an Uber/Lyft. Even if you are going 2 hotels over. You don't realize how large hotels are until you are walking in 110 degree heat.  If you go the pool bring waterproof case for phone. I would not be comfortable leaving phone on chair. Also anything left on a chair will melt. I saw a pair of kids crocs literally smoking on the pool deck.  There is a free water machine at the pool. Use it.  For Bfast/lunch/coffee run across the street to mcdonalds/chipolte etc. Save some money and much quicker.    We did not eat at The Mirage at all so I cannot review any restaurants or room service.    We agreed if the price was right we would stay here again given the location and Pool. I would only recommend this hotel with the expectation its not going to knock your socks off.
30,The casino is trying to get back up and running but they are seriously understaffed. The dealers are irritable because they are all working longer hours than expected. I had a strange incident at a roulette table.. I ( a woman) was surrounded by men all having our money on the table and another man walked up it was full but they asked me to step back.. I stepped aside as to let him squeeze in and she said… no step back! So I had to stand in the back with my money in the table not able to see. I squeezed my way back in and then the second woman working did the exact same thing. She looked at the crowd and pointed to me to step back so the new gentleman can step up completely shutting me out. Needless to say I cashed out. The restaurants were closed most of the day causing us to eat at The Still bar. It was actually very good but two nights in a row was a bit much. One last thing… the beds have seen better days not comfy. But the rooms were clean and housekeeping did a great job.
30,I've stayed at Mirage twice. I chose Mirage because the center strip location can't be beat! You can easily walk to Bellagio and Caesars take a free tram outside to Treasure Island or just cross the street to get to Harrah's and the Linq Promenade. There's also a Walgreens conveniently located across the street so you can stock up on essentials.    I was given a resort room with a volcano view last visit and that was awesome! The rooms are really basic and outdated but as long as it's clean it was fine. I have to take off points for the bathroom - it's small and crammed and is akin to a motel bathroom (shower/tub combo bad showerhead etc.). The pool is heavenly and there are some cool shows (Beatles Love Shin Lim) and attractions (Secret Garden).    During my second visit I experienced major inconveniences with the bathroom. To my delight I was upgraded to a Resort Tower King room which has a separate tub and shower a more secluded elevator and a strip/volcano view. However the shower drain was clogged and it's not fun showering with dirty drain water accumulating. I was unable to switch rooms because they were all taken and I had to wait for a maintenance worker to come to the room to fix it. It put a damper on my trip because I had to wait for a working shower and couldn't start my day until then.
20,I spent a good amount of time researching to find our hotel for the night which is why my disappointment was so high. We walked into the room to find stained carpets and a very dirty window obstructing our “view.” The pool closed at 7 PM and the room service was only from 7 AM to 3 PM. I also cleaned the tub myself before getting in the shower. The only positive was that the mattresses were very comfortable.
50,The Mirage staff provided excellent service and made our stay comfortable. The hotel is beautiful and offers many things to do besides the casino. The food was delicious at all the restaurants we ate at. The hotel rooms are modern clean and classy. The pool was great! I recommend you rent a lounge chair that comes with an umbrella or you will be roasted in the hot Vegas sun. I will definitely stay here again.
10,The mobile check in didn’t work. We had to get in line. Room was dirty and gross. Dirty floors carpet and bathtub. There was only one elevator in the parking garage to get you to the casino. There walkway bridge connecting the parking lot to casino was also closed. Front desk staff was very nice but mobile check in attendant could not answer simple questions.
50,Love the cleanliness and comfort of my room. The staff was very professional and friendly. The cleaning staff also deserve credit for a wonderful job! My only wish is that they have a couple restaurants or deli places that stay open 24 hours. Other than that I’ll continue to stay at this location on the strip!
40,The Mirage is a great place to stay no matter your age. They have a great casino but they also have other activities to enjoy. They have a good variety of eating options. The rooms are clean and quiet. The pool is amazing for any age!
50,We had a fantastic time in Vegas and this hotel was part of the reason. The food was great the hotel was clean and centrally located. The pool was fantastic. It was one of the largest pools I’ve ever swam in.
30,Location is good but quality of bed is not up to mark. The guest service desk is just for show up not customer friendly. I requested for upgrade of room they told next day they will update me . I got message yr room is ready when i connected with guest service they told that got cancelled . What a joke .
50,Spacious clean comfortable friendly staff great pools affordable. Casino had a nice variety of slots and games scattered throughout the property. Decent amount of shops around. Overall excellent stay will be back!
40,Concierge Brian was very helpful and friendly. Great room with closet and dressers. Bathroom is small. Lifeguards need to keep the pool steps clear so people can safely enter/exit the pool. Pool is excellent.
50,Everyone is so friendly and happy your there. I call it home. I've even come by myself and feel comfortable and safe. Salon is great and love the massages.  Casino Host willie is awesome. And mlife desk person ms. Dianna is great!
30,Need a Refrigerator coffee maker complimentary waters not the only option $18 water bottles in the room  then the front desk do nothing to give great customer service only 1 person made me feel welcomed.
20,You can stay somewhere nicer for the same money. Hotel is showing its age and doesn’t deliver on the experience for the money they charge. Nothing special about it and the fact that everything is an up charge forget it
30,Nothing spectacular. Non-upgraded internet is slow and unreliable. No fridge TV is small. The toilet bowl is too shallow and as a man my junk constantly touches the water which is disgusting. Some of the light fixtures didn't work either.
30,The Mirage is back to preparing rooms the pre-COVID way The rooms are not clean it’s clear the room gets a 10 minute turn over between guests. If the hotel is busy there is no where near enough space in restaurants the pool and etc. So you pay a $40/day resort fee and there is no room to use the amenities.
50,Great customer service  we will be back  A bit dated in the rooms but all  was great!! Pantry was awesome  steak house was great  sushi as well.  Slot attendants and ppl in the sports book were all friendly and ready to help when asked!! We will be back!!
10,The rooms are more expensive than others on the strip that are just as nice. The drinks are over priced and they do not send cocktail waitresses around very often while you gamble. Not to mention checking in online doesn’t mean anything when you still have to ask where you’re room is three times.
20,Paid for an upgraded room and got placed next to the elevator. Sounded like I was in a bowling alley. Pool was an absolute zoo. Waited in line for 30 minutes for elevator. Several people cut the line. No security presence to keep order. Property starting to show its age. Property has definitely gone downhill since Covid. I have stayed there five times previously. Only stayed one night then moved to the Bellagio.
50,Exceptional view from the Volcano Room! View of both the volcano show and the strip! Join M-Life Mastercard to upgrade to Pearl status and you will enjoy special benefits!    Restaurants are great shops are nice and location to other venues on the strip is ideal!
30,Perhaps it's challenging to find enough qualified staff but Mirage MGM and actually all of Vegas need to get back to full employment and fully reopen services and Restaurants OR risk losing a generation of loyal patrons/visitors. The staff that are working are terrific. Need a better system to reserve pool chairs. Need to reopen Cravings Buffet asap. The Pantry can't handle the demand. Rooms are due for an update.
40,Don’t wait till you arrive to make dinner reservations. It’s almost impossible to find a table if you wait to the day of to make your plans. The good news is that reservations are super easy to make using the same app that serves as your room key.
10,The mirage service was terrible both checking in and out the elevators for our wing were all down a line formed that was around the corner  Many of the restaurants were closed service was just bad stay somewhere else if you can
50,I absolutely love this resort. The staff is always pleasant and happy to help you we did the mobile check in with the app and our room was ready for check in at 10:30am at no extra charge and we were able to open the room doors with our phone so no reason to wait on line. The towel game was strong this time around if you're not down there by 9am you're not finding a spot close to the pool. I love that you can order food/drinks from your seat and pay without having to hunt anyone down. The rooms are clean and spacious and the location is perfect. Can't wait to be back!
40,The hotel is beautiful but the rooms are starting to have a little more wear Then they are keeping up with. Stains on the carpet in the halls nicks on the edge of the desktop. The pool is very nice. Lacks dining options during covid.
10,Terrible service during check in oversold and we were given double queen room in lieu of king room which was booked and pre-paid for. Would not recommend if you expect what you paid for. If clean is the expectation don’t stay here.
50,Mirage may not be Aria or other MGM properties but what area has is excellent customer service and friendly staff that make your entire trip worth it!    I really enjoyed the casino as well while it may take some time to get handpays this staff are quick to apologize or recognize the delay.
20,Very disappointing as I have stayed here 4 years ago and has aged dramatically! Stayed at other properties 13 times in 7 years. The room carpets are worn. Furniture looks like mice have chewed on it. (See pics). Drapes fell in middle of the night! ( see pics). Cant make this up.. many other better properties for the same money. Choose wisely!
40,The Mirage is one of my fav places to stay but really had some issues this time with food waitresses. I will go back because I love the location but they could improve some things. Coffee and water needs to be better found when looking. Lines are so long you have to leave and go across the street just to get a coffee in the morning.
10,From not having coffee machines in the rooms and having to wait for an hour in long lines to having blood on the bathroom ceiling in a room thay wasn't fully functional there are much better places on the strip to stay!
50,Although I used mobile check in and key kiosk for fast and easy check I never interacted with staff but was observant of the staffs interaction with other guests throughout casino and hotel they were friendly and very professional and helpful
20,Fine place 20 years ago now 3*  Only a fraction of restaurants were open resulting in 1-2 hour waits. No excuse when you know how many rooms you have sold. I never would have believed it would be operated like this.
50,staff was friendly and took care of all our needs. diablos cantina has delicious food. room was very clean and met all of our needs for our 10 day stay for our honeymoon. the volcano show was absolutely amazing a definite must see.
40,Mirage was a perfect hotel to attend a business conference. Proximity from rooms to conference center was short distance and well located. Proximity to the Usher concert next door at Caesar’s was so close and same for the quick walk to Bellagio and Cosmopolitan.Right next door to Forum shops. All amenities at the Mirage were perfect. The exception is breakfast restaurants. Prepare to wait to get in to Pantry restaurant in the morning and especially if you are attending a conference. Same for the long line at the Starbucks. Save yourself from the wait and walk nex door to Caesar’s Cafe Americano for sit down breakfast or carry out and No Waiting. I wish Pantry would change their reservation practices and wish Mirage would offer more options for breakfast. Short of the breakfast experience Mirage was great. PS not sure why Diablos restaurant was allowed to be closed a couple of days a week? Seems shortsighted for revenue and guest experience passing by a closed restaurant.
50,Awesome Hotel great atmosphere loved the restaurants never had a bad meal. Enjoyed the pool and casino. It’s a good location on the strip walking distance to the Linq and Treasure Island. Will definitely stay there again!
50,Ask for Heather from paradise service bar. She is amazing! Cannot say enough nice things about her. My 40th bday and first cabana rental was so worth it. The pool was super nice and perfect for the 117 degree weather. The suite that we rented was nice but it also had bad air flow though that could be due to the super high temps
40,Great location and staff. Let’s wanted to stay here and was not disappointed. Bed is great and you can’t find many MGM properties with a better location. Still struggling a bit with covid as certain things are not open like they used to be and casino floor and bar get overwhelmed with people and not enough places to eat play or drink. Only 4 stars because the room did have a weird mold/mildew smell and the ac really struggled to keep the room below 70. We had ac on lowest setting for 7 nights and it never got chilled. Bathroom is very small. It’s good for the basics that’s about it. You will not be getting ready for a nice night out in there. Overall though it only has minor flaws that are outweighed by the nice workers and perfect location. Pool was also surprisingly good. Decent sized and never felt crowded. Even if you go mid day plenty of seats to be had unlike most other Vegas properties.
40,We had a blast at the hotel. The stay was a lot of fun. Lots of stuff to do. I wished I had more time to explore. We had great drinks and food. Friendly staff that offered help when needed. The hotel and pool area were clean. So was our room. We would stay here again.
40,Overall a comfy place to stay for a one night layover/visit to Sin City. Booked online through the Mirage/MGM website in a Strip View King Room pricing was very transparent and easy to understand how different fees would add onto the cost of the room. Checked in using the Mobile App the day of arrival got a notification the room was ready around 11am (well before the 3pm check-in time). Arrival at the hotel was quick and painless headed to the Mobile Check-In desk and picked up a commemorative plastic key in addition to the digital one on my phone. Room was comfy on the 21st floor overlooking the pool with an angled view of the strip staring at: Harrahs the Forum Shops and Caesars. Within the room standard Vegas room definitely not a suite. Comfortable king sized bed small desk with outlets and lamps bathroom was more than ample despite reading reviews it would be old and small felt very spacious for what it was needed for. Only downside to the room was that there were no convenient outlets near the bed to charge phone and set alarm on it. Had to unplug table lamp to free up an outlet so I could have my phone alarm near the bed and not across room on entryway table. All in all would stay at the Mirage again great price decent resort with very minor setbacks of poor outlet planning and access to viable charging for devices.
10,Our hotel room was filthy. The beds were made but the floors were dirty with debris (food hair safety pins bits of toilet paper etc...) as was the carpet. The bathroom was especially dirty with hair from previous guests and other stuff on the floor. We even found a short thick curly hair on our bathroom ceiling. We requested housekeeping to come and clean and vacuum and they made the beds but did not clean and vacuum as requested. Requested again the following day and same thing. Especially in these times of a pandemic we would think cleanliness is a big thing and extra efforts would be made less just the basic minimum housekeeping preformed in cleaning a room. We were very disappointed and do not plan on returning nor recommending to anyone we know.
20,The title says it all. I had two rooms booked at the same time but they tried to charge me 30% more for one of them. And if your thinking of using their Bell Hop service..... Be prepared to wait.... 4 hours!
20,We had no air in the room we called down to get the maintenance team they came checked it came back with a filter left again said they was going to put the filter in and they never did the room was hot
30,Save your money and stay elsewhere. Rooms need updating the shower heads are terrible beds are ok carpets are dingy and the upholstery needs a serious deep cleaning. Housekeeping on the 6 & 7 floors folded up dirty towels and put them back on the shelf for use. The walls are paper thin elevators are slow no bellman or attendants at the rideshare entrance. We were there with a large group (over 40 rooms booked for our group) and everyone had similar experiences. We were all there for 9+ days and it never got any better. Several of us ended up getting sick from the damp musty rooms. Lunch options within the resort are very limited. You’ll have to use a delivery company if you’re pressed for time during a business trip.
30,I liked the room. Nice location. Beautiful pool area. Everything was extremely overpriced even for the strip. Vegas should be affordable but this hotel seems to gouge at every opportunity. Drinks food parking….$180 to reserve a couple lounge chairs with umbrellas at the pool…..Everything was ridiculously priced. Will not be back!!!
50,Everything about this place is awesome. Its our favorite pool in Vegas. The rooms are alittle dated compared to the newer hotels but still very nice. Will absolutely be staying here again in the future.
10,Checked in and was told that our room was ready but when we opened the room door it was dirty the people had just left and the room was dirty. Had to wait 2 hours for our room to be cleaned. After our room was cleaned we went in and the desk was broken. Not a good expirence.
50,Overall very pleased with our stay at the Mirage. The whole location was well kept staff was very friendly and just a totally pleasant experience. I booked a service at the Salon during our stay as well and it was wonderful. Hope to come back again!
40,Hotel is nice and relaxing. Casino has a decent selection. Secret Garden is always fun. But if you have a problem notify the staff and they will look into resolving it. If you valet though double check they lock your vehicle. I should've double check when I had a gut feeling that night.
40,The Mirage is my all time favorite. Location cleanliness and nicely appointed rooms are tops. My only complaint is there still remains a limited amount of restaurants open and the reservation wait time is unfortunately long as expected.
50,Great place to stay and would recommend to family and friends in the future..clean place and friendly staff members. Gambling was fun and machines were not tight as everyone told us they were...will be returning in the future
50,This is not my first time staying here and there is a reason for that. Easy mobile check in great customer service the places to eat are all delicious and all and all an amazing place to stay. You won’t regret it
40,It was just like a normal hotel room. No issues except both rooms couldn’t be on the same floor even though we asked when we booked the rooms. No plugs near the beds so had to plug the phone across the room.
30,This was my 1st trip to Vegas and loved the casino and its staff and we slept really good in the beds but it would have been nice to have a fridge and a microwave in the room. Also the mini bar didn’t have a price list. Our ac was t working right and we had to set thermostat to 55 for it to be comfortable.  Also the restaurants close at 10 would have been nice for later dining.
40,Great location and walking distance to many hotels and casino on the strip. Friendly staff. Easy check in/ out. Stayed here a few times and I am a little disappointed on the cleanliness and maintenance of the room this time around. Stained carpet hole in bathroom wall toilet paper holder loose on wall and hair from the previous guest.
40,The room was clean. We were traveling on comp rooms. So for the price they were great. But they don't stack up to some of the newer (or recently remodeled) Mgm properties on the strip. If staying in a very luxurious room is your favorite part of going to Vegas then this might not be the property for you. But if you don't care about the latest and greatest room but you're looking for a really nice property with a great pool and excellent service.. this is truly a vegas classic.
40,This is a very nice hotel. The staff was wonderful and the atmosphere was great. I do wish that ALL rooms had certain amenities such as a mini refrigerator and microwave. So that would be the biggest improvement that I can think of. But I really enjoyed my stay and would recommend to others.
40,The Mirage is a very nice hotel. Rooms are huge and beautiful. Although the air seemed to be controlled by the hotel as we could never get our room cold or to the degree that made us comfortable. Otherwise the room was huge beautiful and close to the elevators which I really love.
30,For the price (300+) would expect a little more. There was an item left from previous guest (ick) and torn drapery. Expected better from mgm property - have always enjoyed my prior stays @ Mirage. Maybe post-pan issues?
10,Customer service was horrible this stay could not get my room serviced bathroom was not all of the way cleaned escalators were broken when I arrived Saturday and still broken with my no repairs on Tuesday when I departed I’ve never dealt with experience before and I do t think I would be back.
20,I booked a room and tried calling around 12:30 am to ask questions before check in and there is only an automated response to call back within business hours. I have never seen a hotel that doesn’t have a 24 hour front desk phone line. Has difficulties with the room key parking that was not recognizing. They closed off the walkway from garage so have to go take an elevator down. Walk across the street and take another elevator up to get to the rooms. I was exhausted by the time I got to my room. The front desk lines are crazy they should have more staff. More than likely I will choose another hotel for my next stay.
50,Our stay at the Mirage was both memorable and enjoyable. We look forward to our soon to be scheduled return. The Mirage is a beautiful casino which lifts our mood whenever we stay there. The rooms are conveniently located making access to all within minutes
10,Leak from bathroom cause damage to clothes and horrible mildew smell. When reported to front desk no compensation or apology given. No talks of trying to make situation better at all. Worst hotel room I have ever stayed in in Vegas
40,Checked in and it was too soothing and too easy. Always great when you are tired from the hot weather long drive. Everything was great except for the elevators breaking during the busy weekend. Had to stay in line to get to the room and back to the casino. Kinda threw off my mojo.
10,The entire floor to ceiling Windows were cracked the refrigerator and the ice maker was broken. The furniture needs to be updated. Make sure they DO NOT PUT YOU IN ROOM D49!! The girl took off 2 nights stay but I would have rather paid for what I was expecting.
10,we had no hot water for three days had to take cold showers gave away our checked in room to another person and then made us move to another room long waits for restaurants not enough restaurants open to accommodate convention most meals you had to wait 45 mins to an hour
50,Great location. Great restaurant selection. Close to everything. Very friendly Valet service. Superb quick room service. Nobody bugs you. Security doesn’t harass guests or cause undue stress. The sport bar could upgrade the sports book to a beer and chicken wings FYI Mirage. Empower the waitress to serve guests and to always acknowledge a guest even if you can’t serve them. A pet peeve of mine. Eye contact hand gestures something. Don’t turn your head from me as a custom.
20,The Mirage is open but does not really seem ready for customers. Lots of machines were out of order for multiple reasons they are very understaffed and the check in process is not very efficient.  In one tower they only had one or two out of six elevators working the wait time to get to your room at times was over 30min. It seemed like they were having major issues with the air conditioning which was tough when the outside temp was 116 deg.
50,The whole casino environment was amazing. The upbeat tempo and friendly staff made my vacation a memory of a lifetime. I found my forever getaway hotel. The casino was just as amazing. Every dealer was excited to be in the moment.
10,The CPK (btw this is a franchise location and should not be confused with the actual California CPK restaurants who always exhibit the best service!!!) discriminates against people with an under 10 age child. The room had t.v issues and the lights went out in the bathroom. The pool floats they rent sink because they are so overused and I have chunks ripped off(and they still tried to rent it??) Baffling.....stay somewhere else. There were more issues but I feel like enough of my life was wasted on this trip to rehash it now and give them any more time.
40,First time at the hotel - easy check in and check out - rooms could probably do with an update but very clean. Major complaint is several of the restaurants were closed while we were there. Pool was nice but had a LOT of kids in it. Overall not complaining. I like to stay at different hotels in LV but I can say I stayed here now.
10,My husband and I booked a king suite well in advance to celebrate our anniversary. The evening we arrived to check in we were told our room was unavailable as it was overbooked. We had to settle for a room with 2 queen beds. It really did put a damper on our celebratory stay.
10,While the hotel was nice we left our personal possessions laying in our room along with clothing lying out and decided to hang up the do not disturb sign up and go shopping. Upon our return we had to wait 15 minutes in the hallway while house keeping cleaned our room we didn’t want cleaned in the first place. This was inconvenient inappropriate and embarrassing what if you were sleeping or in the shower? I have never had this happen and raises the question of why would house keeping wish to be in your room so badly in the first place. Refusing service would make their job easier however guests are more likely to have personal possessions in their room with the do not disturb sign hanging up. Seems kind of fishy that being said I do not plan on staying here again nor do I recommend this place.
50,We were able to use a MyVegas Premium reward for Tuesday night Wednesday night stay for only resort fees ($80/2 nights)and an early check in fee ($40) - $120 plus taxes! Amazing value for a beautiful well located hotel. 10 minutes walk to The Linq Promenade 20 minutes to Paris. 10 to Caesars 20 to Bellagio Fountains. Harrah's and Venetian across the boulevard. Pool is fantastic with waterfall. Volcano show is a must!
50,Im happy I booked this hotel for my first visit to Las Vegas. I checked in late about 1am so no wait. And check out on my phone with a late check out. Rented a car with a easy process right In the lobby. I will return to this hotel.
30,Rooms are outdated but good enough given the location. There are nicer places to stay. Be prepared for the usual resort fee charges.    Table minimums are high. We were there on Thursday through Sunday. On Saturday night all the craps tables were $25. For the casual player those are way to high. There were no other options. Even on Thursday you had to play $15. Harrah's across the street had $10 tables.    If you want to maximize your blackjack play play close attention to the blackjack payout signs. Most of the tables pay 6/5. Need to hunt around for a 3/2 payout and those are only given minimum bets of $25 and higher. Even if you are playing at the $25 minimums some of those are 6/5. On Sunday morning on the main floor there were no 3/2 blackjack tables open. Where you find out the blackjack payouts is on the electronic sign in small print. I will say at least the 6/5 is on the electronic sign which can be changed to 3/2 vs. going to Harrah's across the street were the 6/5 is printed on the table felt so there is no chance it will ever be anything but 6/5 at Harrah's. I feel like they are really squeezing the customers with the 6/5 blackjacks. How many blackjacks do you really get! Why not make the customer happy vs. feeling like they are being cheated with the 6/5 payout.    The pool area is decent. Although I wish they would somehow monitor the chair saving. Very few people lounging. Mostly a sea of white towels with no people sitting in them. Makes it hard to get a spot if you are not there right when it opens.
50,The staff was very friendly and efficient when I had a small issue which was cleared up immediately. The location is perfect- near the middle of the strip and you can walk either direction easily. Hotel was very clean! Check in/out was a breeze
20,Had to change rooms twice because the hotel overbooked during our stay. The rooms have no services: no coffee no refrigerator and no microwave. The TV service in the room went out constantly. The garage elevators were constantly out of service making it extremely difficult during check-in and check-out with luggage transport. The price of the room was way too expensive for the lack of quality and services. The hotel only has two places to buy coffee and had to wait in hour long line to get some. The only positive thing I can say is that the beds were comfortable.
40,There are many great things about the Mirage. You cannot beat the location. It has the best pool in Vegas hands down. The layout of the resort is convenient. The public spaces are lovely. There are 2 improvements that need to be made. The private areas rooms and suites need refreshing. Carpets are older furnishings worn. The restaurants which are very good are too often closed causing too long of waits for remaining locations.
20,The room was outdated and the shower clogged multiple times. The table games were very expensive and we only saw a hand full of tables actually open. The buffet was closed still and most of the restaurants were closed Monday and Tuesday. That being said the bed was comfortable. We probably won't be staying here again.
50,Staff was great and rooms are clean the location was also great as it’s on the strip and my kids enjoyed the volcano the dolphins and tigers. We will definitely stay here again. Plus all the staff is very professional and helpful
40,We ended our two week road trip around Utahs National Parks with a three night stay at the Mirage. Enjoyed a full day at the pool. Paid for the reserved lounge chairs a bit pricy but well worth It when the temperature was 115. Staff Pool side was amazing! Rooms were super comfortable. Overall a great stay
10,Room on 2nd floor facing a plant type building. Motel 6 quality. Broken electrical outlet small bathroom.  Housekeeping and room service staff excellent.  Don't count on getting a wheelchair or scooter from the Mirage. Plan ahead and order from an outside vendor
10,me my husband and my friend went to vegas for the weekend. We love vegas and we go about 4 times a year. we've stayed in almost all the hotels but The Mirage let us down this time. I had already stayed at the Mirage as it was our birthday. everything was great in 2018. but this time it was the worst! our room was 11047 they put us in the room next to the dd ice machine. it was noise all night and all morning! our room had a bad smell of something rotten and musty. we thought it was something we ate inside the room. but it wasn't. it was the smell of rotten water i believe it was from the ice machine leaking into the room. there was a stain on the carpet. in the bathroom shower water ran off the curtain and formed a puddle in the bathroom. I got a little potato chip that sells for $1 dollar. when it was charged at check out it was the amount of $10. there was no table with the prices of things. I stayed last month at the Palazzo and ate the same potato for $5. it had no accessible outlets to charge the cell phone near the bed. when we were leaving and in the elevator the door had problems. people entered and the door closed as people entered. p sensor was not finning and pressed people until someone inside pressed the button to open it again. it caught me and my friend was lucky that my husband opened the door that held us. was closing on everyone who entered
40,"My wife and I have stayed at the Mirage numerous many times over the last twenty years. The strip location is great and access in/out is better than most hotels there. It is reasonably priced compared to the other strip hotels where I don't feel ""gouged"". The facilities are always clean."
30,Just a lot of problems.. non working ac ice machine on floor not working when 115 plus out.. front desk staff a little rude as I had to call down a few times.. would think about a nicer MGM resort option next time
40,It’s an older property it still charming. The staff was amazing. We’ve been spoiled by Disney hotels and their friendly Staff and the Mirage has been the only hotel that compares. Every single housekeeping staff member went out of their way to greet us in the hall and were quick to provide us with anything we needed. We were here on a family trip for a dance convention and this hotel was perfect. Great location and layout. The lack of coffee makers and refrigerators were noticed but we did our homework and we’re able to bring an ice chest and Kurrig since we drove. Other families had the same plan and there was a challenge getting ice. Rumor was that the front desk would send ice if you called. For an adults only trip we would chose a newer and fancier hotel. For a family trip this hotel was fine. The pool was great and chairs were available in the afternoon. Otherwise there were planters that you could set stuff onwhen in the pool.
30,They got you coming and going no coffee makers no refrigerators and microwaves you have to buy pretty much everything in the Hotel example breakfast sandwich 20 $25 cup of coffee example 5 to $10 an average breakfast $25-$30
40,Had 2 Speeraye Reservations . Came With My Kids My Boyfriend And Mom. Wish We Could Have Had Conjoined Rooms But Milly Was Sure To At Least Give Us A Strip View. Cannot Blame Them . It Was A Sold Out Resort. Housekeeping Was Great. Rooms Were Cleanly During Our Stay.
40,"Very nice hotel in the middle of all the strip. Would give 5 stars but took 5 hours to check into our ""VIP"" room. Staff is amazing hotel is beautiful and most bars have unique views. The pool area is very spacious and family friendly but the adult bare lounge is the place yo be in the back."
20,OVERWHELMINGLY busy. Restaurants not always open and very hard to get a quick bite!! TERRIBLE for a long stay. No coffee maker fridge or microwave. Maybe would be fine for a weekend bit not an 8 day stay like ours
20,Very disappointed from the start. Horrible checking in experience. Booked way in advance of two rooms. Was not told about the $40 guarantee fee until check in. Was not accommodated until the next day only after I called the front desk to complain after already complaining at check in. Was not told they were going to put me in connecting rooms until I called but they stated they were however no one informed me. We had a large group and they that started out the trip on a sour note.
10,No coffee before 6am no food options after 11pm room had no clock or wastebasket no refrigerator (your chilled in room vending machine doesn't count) overrun by children the hotel scheduled National Dance Volleyball and Cheerleader competitions simultaneously making it virtually impossible to eat during competition breaks. Not happy at all with my very LAST stay.
10,I payed a lot for my dirty gross run down room! I had to move rooms only to move to another dirty room. My friends that stayed her all had the same experience. Stained old carpet filthy doors walls and surfaces! Pick somewhere else to stay!
40,Have stayed at The Mirage many times. As of this visit there is still a long way to go before they are fully open. Long lines reduced hours getting expensive ($6 for a 12 oz can of Coke from room service with my meal) Buffet Closed no shows limited table games open.
40,Vegas is back! We had a great trip and the hotel was in good shape. (Much cleaner than the MGM Grand from our trip in March) The room itself was clean. The shower could use a little TLC but that happens. (A bit of mold in the upper right hand side of the shower and the shower head wasn't very adjustable) The hotel is an old hotel that has been remodeled. Do not expect a large bathroom. This is a standard small hotel bathroom. The room decor is beautiful. Spacious layout and clean bedding. The three of us were very comfortable in our room. Even with 113 degree temps our room did manage to stay a decent temperature. I love the pool area. It is one of my favorites. 1 warning. Be prepared for lines to get into the pool area at opening. There are chair hogs who mark their spot for the entire day but don't sit there all day. The casino floor was clean. They are fantastic about keeping trash picked up etc.
50,We stayed there for a dance convention and couldn’t have been happier with our experience. Staff was so friendly and accommodating (and patient!). Food was delicious! Loved the app feature to essentially do anything you needed from it! Would highly recommend and would absolutely stay there again!
30,My husband and I stayed here for a little getaway. Our room had 2 fake finger nails on the floor it looked like the floors haven't been vacuum. The TV kept cutting out after being in the heat all day we wanted to come back to watch TV and relax before going back out. The elevators in the parking garage weren't working
20,"Disappointed! Room was ""old"" looking; towels were not always provided without calling housekeeping; refrigerator had no room to cool water bottles we purchased; the pool was overrun with children and there was minimal shade if any; food was difficult to get and was verrrrry expensive."
50,From the moment we checked in to the moment we left the customer service and staff friendliness was the best. Our upgraded room had a perfect view of the strip and the volcano. every staff member we encountered was always smiling and friendly. Rooms and hotel were clean and beautiful. Only bummer was Beatles Love was not open yet but that is no fault of the hotel. Will definitely stay here again and recommend.
40,There were lots of changes at the Mirage on this trip. Pool hours are less CA Pizza Kitchen was only open Wed.-Sun. new restaurants throughout but all had good food and service if you made a reservation or got there at odd times. All in all it was a great trip!
50,Fantastic location service pool! The dining choices are great; We never left the resort! We especially liked The Still and Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak. The Pantry is a great choice for breakfast or a casual snack. Love the spa and salon too!
30,$9 waters and $39+tax Resort fee per day for access to the WiFi pool and Fitness Center. The WiFi was horrible and regular data connection was bad as well. Pool was packed and no shade unless you were willing to pay more than $100 for 2 hours. Fitness Center was tiny and packed in. Staff was friendly.
20,We got flea bites on us the very first night. Complained and we changed rooms. Carpets were not vacuumed we were walking on crumbs also the clocks were missing. Asked 3x and never got them so we gave up asking. Traveled with grandparents and our two kids 9 and 7 who loved the big spacious rooms but not the bites or dirty carpets. We got the two bedroom suite to celebrate our daughter's 7th bday.
50,Spending a milestone birthday at the Mirage was just what I needed!  The atmosphere was awesome along with the staff. There is an excellent variety of restaurants. Lots of great slot machines! Can't wait to do it again!
50,We loved our stay at The Mirage very child friendly and the shows are amazing dolphin show secret garden etc.Their pool is really awesome with a tropical ambience! The price is affordable as well! What else could i ask for a hotel in Vegas?
30,this hotel is run down. we had a strip view which was a good view but the rooms are in poor repair. our bathroom wasn't very clean (there was hair in the bathtub and sticky stuff on the floor. bathroom door whouldn't latch. beds were comfortable. The Pool is nice.
40,The hotel itself is amazing. My only complaints are that the couch in our room smelled like dog real bad our mini fridge didn't work to well and our Spa tub didn't work at all and that was one of the main reasons I booked the room I did.
20,Let me start off by saying I never leave reviews. We all have different opinions and expect different things. This was our 4th trip to Vegas. Got to our room at the mirage and there was one of those 48oz tube cups on the floor. AC didn’t work. It was 112 outside. Never came to repair. Couldn’t sleep well to muggy. We went to desk the first day about the AC. we also called the front desk the next day. They explained it shuts off if nobody is in the room. The hallway was nice and cool but our room was not. This was by far the worst stay in Vegas. I would not recommend staying here. On the bright side. The pool was awesome and the staff was great. From getting towels to drinks very nice and friendly. But we will never stay here again. Treasure Island planet Hollywood and MGM Grand the other places we have stayed in. All highly recommended.
10,Because the room I had reserved was not available; rollaway bed was uncomfortable; bathroom had water all over the floor; second room had problems; third room was fine; breakfast at the Pantry was terrible (potatoes were cold sausage links over cooked and coffee luke warm. Porpoise show was a joke; lion and tiger enclosure smelled like a pig farm. And last but not least the slots were tighter that I’ve seen at any casino.
30,We switched rooms 3 times due to cleanliness issues including what appeared to be vomit on 2 room windows and several human hairs found in the first room. On the towels on the light switch and shower wall and ice bucket and sink area. 2nd room had sticky mess all over the desk area. 3rd room was acceptable but the bathroom vent did not work and the room came with one small trash can in the bathroom. Beds and pillows were comfortable. Half of the restaurants were closed while others were on reservations only. Room service wasn’t available either. Eating was more of a chore than it should be considering the size of the resort.
30,We had small knat type of flies that kept showing up in our room. I killed several and then more would show up throughout the room and bathroom. I took plenty of pictures as it was insane to see this in a hotel like the Mirage!! Never again will we stay there as the beds were even the best and paid parking is also crazy when most hotels surrounding are free..
30,Staff was very helpful and professional.  Bell desk was quick and efficient  Pool staff was berry friendly and the servers very kind  The room was not clean. Torn curtains scum in drain of tub and shower head. Tub has stains it was not clean
50,I had a great stay at Mirage the staff was accomodating & friendly It has all the aminities you need for a good vacation I would surely go back to Mirage Hotel casino anytime I want to go to Las Vegas.
10,This resort used to be great but service and room conditions have drastically gone down. We had water leaking into our bathroom and we’re moved to another room. My wife couldn’t get into the new room so she went to the front desk and the girl there was rude to her luckily the manager was kind and helped. The move took half the day so we decided to stay another night. The motel (which is what level this place is at now) didn’t give any kind of deal for our fourth night. I didn’t want a comp night just a deal better than what was online. The fourth night was more than the first three nights combined. We could here every conversation in the hallway and the people in the room next to us were kind enough to start yelling at 6am. We ate at the Pantry and that was a mistake. Food was ok but it took an hour to get it. I’m definitely going to be voting at the next stockholders meeting.
50,We had an exceptional experience and would stay again! The staff was extremely friendly and the Italian restaurant Costa Osteria in the hotel was delicious. The check in and check out process was very easy. The hotel room was clean as well.
30,It was nearly impossible to get some coffee in the morning. There were no pots in the room which would be fine except they were understaffed and waits at coffee shops were 45 minutes or more every morning. Even the convenience stores didn’t stock any kind of bottled coffee drinks. Being 100 degrees at 9 am walking to another casino for coffee felt ridiculous. With as much as it cost to stay there basic amenities shouldn’t be so hard to find.    Hotel was beautiful loved the pool and aquarium.
20,The rooms need to be updated. Our box spring cover had stains and the room smelled musty. Carpets were old and the did not look vacuumed. There was no late night food options. The morning lines for coffee were 45 minutes to 1 hour which is ridiculous. Location is great but I do not think I will return
40,I stay in Vegas often usually at a little nicer resort but I like the location and price compared to others nearby    Reg King room is good size and comfortable. Nothing special but good enoughTrash can had old chewed nuts in it and bed sheets were soiled or stained    I gave 4 stars instead of 3 because of proximity to Bellagio Fashion Mall Ceasars Venetian and others
10,How else would you describe an extremely average stay the window was full of bird crap that you would feel disgusted.  The overall stay was very average  The buffet was made us believe that it was open but was close with no notification or advisory
20,I was told at check-in (around 1am) that there was not a pet relief area on the property. I took my SD to the opposite side of Valet parking but at checkout was told there was a pet relief area. This should be marked throughout the property instead of being dependent on an uneducated hotel employee.
10,Unfortunately we did not have the best experience at Mirage Las Vegas. As frequent travelers to Vegas we have found that Caesars properties not only are accommodating but have friendly associates and all together care about the experience you have.
30,Randy the bruting roulette dealer was the most loathing character to be at Mirage. He was condescending not personable belittling and rude to my fiance and I. He was so rude the Casino Pit Boss gave us $50 gift certificate to make up for our experience and we were told to mention it here.
30,Not enough staff to service the clients. Everything/every line even at the gift shop to the restaurants over an hour wait and very overpriced.  Room service had an 18% gratuity plus 2 different service fees and 90.00 later for breakfast sandwich and pancakes. So the value definitely not there.
40,Location is great great food and restaurants. I liked the idea of digital keys and creating your own room key without having to see guest services if you take advantage of mobile check-in option. Room size is okay. Bathroom is extremely small and beds are very uncomfortable but over all good hotel.
50,Great pool with water fall area. Walking distance to center strip. MLife Rewards to book room only paid resort fee for room. Play pop slots my vegas etc. Digital room key is the best the MGM app let's you know when room is ready and no waiting in line to check in.
50,I went solo and as a female I never once felt uncomfortable at the mirage between security and the workers. They also had amazing front desk staff that was extremely kind and helpful. Due to COVID lines were long and food service was slow but it’s expected and the workers kept their moral up even with nasty customers !
30,Elevators are in the middle of casino not next to check in. Our room smelled like urine. Staff was very rude. Cleaning staff was very nice. Wont ever go back to this hotel. Hotel is gorgeous but not for us
40,They had half of the restaurants closed so there were long lines long waits (1 hour common) and flustered (overworked) staff which made the dining experience very poor. Other casinos that we visited had no lines at all. Everything else was excellent.
30,This is still one of the most beautiful hotels from the outside. Vegas advertises itself as 100% open now post Co-vid but that is not at all the case.  Hotel restaurants close at 10 pm and some of them are closed during day hours and open only in late afternoon or on the weekend. We spent a week at the mirage  Primary obeservations of this hotel.  No coffee pot in room. Every morning we had to stand in VERY long line to try and buy some coffe. Large hotel so lots of walking down long hallway through the casino over to a starbucks or other such coffee provider. Not a hospitable way to run a hotel.  No way to keep water or softdrinks cold other to buy something out of the expensive mini bar.  Bedding was not in keeping with a quality hotel. Flat sheets on bottom keep coming off the bed. Need Fitted sheets. It's a fight to get into the bed since the maids are instructed to make the beds tightly sheeted. When you pull and pull on sheets on top to be able to get into the bed the bottom flat sheets come undone also! Top duvet very very thin almost like a sheet. Mirage needs to at least put coffee pots in the rooms.  Hotel needs a good carpet cleaning or replacement.  Location is excellent since it is midstrip.  No instructions on how to handle the contacless check in so we did not see many people in that area at all causing long lines at associate assisted check in.
50,The Mirage never disappoints. The casino floor was clean and offered many slots and table games. The restaurant options will appeal to someone looking for a quick bite sit-down or higher end meal. The sports book is big and exciting to be in. The location allows for a short to walk to many other casinos including Harrahs Treasure Island Caesars Venetian etc.
50,The Mirage Resort has always been a favorite I have to admit I was a little apprehensive with booking my stay during a Pandemic or shortly after but all praises to the Mirage for the exceptional Customer Service Hotel Cleanliness and room accommodations. My staff and I were all taken care of and appreciated the extra measures taken with sanitizing all areas of the hotel for a comfortable stay.
20,"stayed here many times in the past but the 24th ""upgraded"" end of the hall smelled like a sewer during our visit. Many of the restaurants close early or do not open at all. Only one ticket/atm machine worked."
10,Staff was rude and our room was filthy. Stains on the carpets. Restaurant staff was rude as well as the hotel staff. Out of all the hotels to stay at in Vegas the mirage should not be 1 of them. Horrible!
20,We stayed a couple of nights. The room had a uneven mattress extension cords exposed cracked tubs and torn headboard. The place needs updated compared to the new casino/hotels around now. We couldn't even eat in our own hotel because most restaurants are still closed and what is open have waitlists hours long. The staff and service people are great. Overpriced restaurants are open we would never pay that much for average food. Kids were running around everywhere too loud and over crowded pool.
30,This hotel seems outdated for the price in comparison to other nearby hotels. Staff was mostly rude and overwhelmed. The fact that you have to pay to have any shade at the pool seems over the top. Almost everything closes by 8pm.
10,The Vegas I grew up with pre COVID and woke is gone. No buffet no poker room no service in the gaming floor(black waitresses intentionally focused on service of people of color and showed resentment towards service of people not of color.)
30,Beautiful casino but very basic rooms for the price. There seemed to be SEVERAL children's sports competitions going on this weekend which is fine since this is not an adult only hotel but would have been nice to know ahead of time and maybe would have stayed somewhere else. Pool was crowded with kids and guests from other hotels. No lounge chair or cabana availability the entire weekend.
50,Mirage has beautiful surroundings and comfortable casino. Customer service was excellent especially the bell staff. Bare Pool lounge was relaxing and fun until it got too crowded. We would definitely stay at this resort again!
40,The trip was for our 10 year anniversary. Got a deal at the pool with chairs. Girl at the spa was very nice and accommodating. Rooms are nice just need to work on the minor details of the room. Also staff was friendly.
30,We used the Mirage for all of our dining options on our stay. Many of the restaurants closed at 10 pm or were closed two days of the week. We were on property for a large dance competition and some nights didn’t finish with awards till 10 pm or later and there were no food options open which made things tricky. I also had an issue with used razor blades and dirty underwear behind the headboard where we slept for many nights. They gave us a small food and beverage credit that barely covered one breakfast and a couple of nights credit on taxes and hotel “fees” not room rates. I also paid a premium for a Stay Well room to have a clean and comfortable stay only to be sorry I bothered. The morning we tried to check out I called the bell desk and was told they didn’t start till 6am and no one could help us get out luggage out. When I dragged all my bags out to the front there were 4 strapping bell men just talking and hanging from their carts. The nicest part about being at the Mirage for 8 days was the maid staff who were sweet and friendly everyday.
50,Went with my wife for two nights. Both had an amazing time  definitely returning. The casino was fun and so many slots to choose from. The pantry 24 hr room service was the best. Delicious food and fast service.
40,As Always we enjoyed our twice annual visit to the Mirage. Location is superb. Unfortunately for us our timing was bad as the hotel was hosting two contests at once which made the hotel feel like a Disney event. Great staff and super clean rooms.
40,Review The Mirage has always been beautiful but it truly needs on desperate upgrade from the rooms to the casino it just needs a new fresh new look desperate need after 35 years to be redone! Hopefully MGM a put some money into the Mirage
50,Beautiful lobby great staff wonderful stay! The newly remodeled bathroom was so nice. Ive never taken a bath at a hotel before but that tub was too great to pass up. The restaurants were top notch. Looking forward to visiting again.
10,This hotel would be fine if you wanted to gamble but not for a 17 year old girls participating in a National volleyball tournament because you have to walk through a smoke filled casino  We had to be at this tournament.
20,The room smelled really musty and looked like it really needs to be renovated. We arranged for late checkout and the security guard came and knocked at our door early before we had even gotten out of bed (like nobody ever told housekeeping that we had arranged for late checkout?) Not too impressed with the place 😞👎You can find a better place off the Strip for less money and much nicer accommodations too! South Point is really nice. Also be aware that all of the Restaurants close around there at midnight. There's only one cafe open in the Mirage after midnight and a hot dog will cost you $11. You will have a much better selection of restaurants open later and a nicer hotel if you stay off the Strip. Even Fremont Street/Downtown is nice. So just go party on the Strip but sleep/stay elsewhere & Uber if you need to. Vegas has definitely changed since the whole Covid-19 Shutdown. Used to be that you could find all kinds of places open 24 hours/day or super late. But now everybody wants to close at midnight 😪
40,"The Mirage is a go-to property for me - has been for almost twenty years. All the usual greatness is (almost) fully in-play as we move away from the worst of the Pandemic. Still missing it's fantastic breakfast buffet plus several restaurants are still not open throughout the day as they were previously. Table minimums have always been a notch higher here - now seems normal since EVERYWHERE the minimums are up including Downtown (crappy 6:5 also bleeding everywhere). Biggest problem was the hotel booking the insane numbers of dance girlies and their daught...wait I mean dance girlies and their mommies. This crowd usually swarms over the MGM properties to the south (Excalibur Luxor). Somehow our pina-colada-scented paradise was turned into a sea of mommies living vicariously through their made-up false-eye-lashed nine-year-old girls and fathers sentenced to not enjoy LV as they wore their ""Dance Dad"" t-shirts. Vegas for adults was turned into Disneyworld or a mall on a Saturday with an American Girl store in it. I can't get too mad at the Mirage for this as they were more-than-happy to fill up their rooms during the off-week period (Mon-Thurs) with bodies. This is probably not an issue when the real conventions start up again and fill those rooms with adults instead of families of six."
50,I stayed at the Mirage for a tournament. I felt it was an extremely safe environment for my teen daughter. The hotel was clean. The restaurants were amazing! I recommend the sea bass at Otoro! If you want a great family and adult experience in the the heart of the strip I recommend the Mirage.
20,"We chose the Mirage out of convenience to the event that we attended. I won't be staying there again in the future. The Mirage feels like it doesn't know what it is on the inside. The cleaning staff were rude on multiple occasions and woke us up at midnight despite the privacy sign being on the door. Despite their rudeness the rooms never felt ""clean"". The tub was backed up there was a different lightbulb out everyday and plenty of junk visible dirt and debris in the hallways. Basically a dark dingy smoke riddled hotel with a great pool.    The pool is great the food at the pool is awesome...but that's it. That's what the mirage has going for it. Nothing else to see here.    Full disclaimer I think this is my 3rd review ever...most of the time I go out of my way to compliment people that deserve it and RARELY ever go on to write a negative review...but Mirage definitely earned it."
10,This hotel is not prepared for reopening. It took me 2 hours to get through the valet line 2 hours to check-in and 1.5 hours to receive my bags… I wasn’t settled until 1am. There were no spots available by the pool all restaurants had slow service and the employees were frantic order ahead apps were down our bell hop demanded a tip and would not leave until we gave him something our maid walked in without knocking or shower floor was dirty and the drain didn’t work properly ice machine was always out and the room smelled like feet. I wish I didn’t give them a single penny and would have left if it wasn’t for the fact that I had to stay there for work.
30,Parking was a hassle. The keycard never worked even after speaking with the front desk. I was put on the second floor which had a view off all the trash thrown out from the upper floor. Shower head had a leak too.
10,I would not go back there terrible service and unsanitary room bed sheets never replaced with a clean one. I know because I marked the side of the sheets with eyeliner. We get questioned whenever we needed new set of towels. I’m sorry we are a family of 3 that showers twice a day. The room smells musty carpet has dark stains everywhere shower doesn’t work properly and the tub overflow.
50,I love mirage my late husband always wanted to stay here its our home away from home. I was there in his memory celebration. I will return in a few months. The ataff his great!! Steak house is soooo yummy
10,I wrote in another survey how dirty the rooms were. Housekeeping comes when asked but they don't even have the for of product to clean a tub or sink. Not one day did housekeeping have a vacuum on our floor and missed clearly accidentally spilled product on the glass table. Just dirty
40,We love the Mirage! This stay was on par with all others - excellent! Room was clean well-serviced with a great view. Slots were good to us and the location is premium. We will definitely be back! The only reason this wasn’t a 5-star experience was because the buffet still isn’t open. We always love Cravings for brunch. We reserved seats at the pool and the atmosphere and service were excellent. We will return - but please open Cravings!
30,This property is dated and the housekeeping experience in getting towels that were not in the room when we checked in was very unsatisfactory…three phone calls and on the third being sent to the front desk only to be put on hold.
30,"What's with these down type pillows that are 1 foot tall then when you put your head on it it deflates to one INCH?!!! Requires TWO pillows to sleep and they are huge and STILL don't do the job. The worst thing is the Mirage REFUSES to place even one normal pillow in the closet for their guests to choose. They KNOW people hate these pillows but do NOTHING but take the ""take it or leave it"" approach. I'm switching properties for this exact reason and will no longer stay at Mirage ever again.    Checking out by TV? Good luck DOESN'T WORK. Checking out via the email they sent you? Good luck DOESN'T WORK. Checking out by calling downstairs the morning of checkout? Good luck they won't answer forcing you to go down to the check in/out area which is full of people.    Oh yeah one more thing. Thinking of bringing your own water etc to put in the fridge to keep cold? No can do! Its locked forcing you to buy their overpriced drinks to stay alive in this desert location.    I can't continue to give my money to an outfit (Mirage/MGM) who values its guest so little. BYE FOREVER MIRAGE"
50,Great Hotel it's clean and smells great. The hotel also have great restaurants and the food is good.. I also enjoyed the casino floor there.. Overall the casino is very nice and I will be going back.. No compliance on my end.
50,Excellent service and cleanliness.Is in such a good spot I’d recommend to anyone.The next time I would just ask for a higher room on the strip side that way I could a great view from a great location.
50,We love the Mirage - we had a beautiful room great atmosphere good value and service. It is in a central location with easy access to many places. There aren’t a lot of restaurants or eating availability but there is in the Forum which is next door. Enjoy!!!
10,Check-in issues unauthorized charges not wanting to give towels restaurants close early or not open at all. Customer service is basically non existent at this hotel. Cleanliness was lacking. We visited many hotels while in Vegas and will definitely not be staying here again.
30,My family and I were there for a dance competition. We arrived to the hotel and. Prices our room had several issues. We called and nothing was done. They said it was noted and that’s it. I really don’t want to be charged for something I didn’t do. They should not give the room of the conditions are not immaculate. Especially because we pay a lot for the room.
10,We had terrible experience at Mirage for one week for my daughter’s KAR dance Competition from 6/25-7/2/21. The room was terrible and noisy at nights. We can’t sleep well. The bell desk was terrible experiences and we can’t get our luggages short time. The bell desk employees got off work early than their work schedule. Therefore bell desk was no one answered the phone and there was no people to deliver the luggages to our room. We was so sad that we can’t get our luggages after we check in. We had terrible experiences to stay at Mirage for one week. It was so disappointed that we paid almost $1400 with bad experiences at Mirage.
10,Rude front desk and overall customer service. Horrible room. I asked to upgrade my room to 2 bedrooms suite but they said it was full. I checked on their website and it was still available. Horrible experience ever. I stayed there many times before. This was the worst of the worst!!
50,The mirage is ready to deliver excellent welcoming friendly service. Even with employee shortages the place looked great. Staff very personable. A few lines expected given incentives not to work the Mirage managed to have top shelf people on hand. The front desk Debbie was amazingly cherry and friendly. Gave us a great room location for our 43 anniversary.
40,Decided to stay here during a last minute trip to Vegas. Wasn’t excited about the mirage but gave it a try since I’ve never stayed here plus I had Comp rooms through MGM Rewards. After my stay I can honestly say that I really like the vibe at The Mirage. It’s clean the staff is awesome and it’s located right in the middle of all the action on the Las Vegas strip.  The only thing I could complain about would be the Resort King bathroom is small. Other than that the place is clean renovated and you have everything you need.    An extra plus is the store near the guest elevators. It was easy to go down to purchase drinks snacks and even toiletries. It’s super convenient.
50,Relaxing easy check in/check out process. Parking was a bit difficult to get to (self park). Hotel was clean friendly staff. Rooms were cozy having the mini bar in the room was a nice addition but I’m sure a very expensive one.
50,So pleasantly surprised at this hotel! Great for families! Spacious and incredible rooms. Awesome and efficient valet service! Impeccable housekeeping service and great choices for food. The app based check in is truly a blessing! I never went to the front desk.
50,Over 30 years old but still classy. Though showing her age the Mirage is by far a gem of a resort. I look forward to spending my B'day week there for as long as I'm able. My wife and I love the vibe and energy of the entire complex.
50,This is the second time we have stayed at the Mirage. This time our room over looked the Volcano. It was great watching it from our room. The casino is a nice size NOT overwhelming ! The staff was outstanding and very helpful. We ate at several of the eatery's and because the portions were large we shared our meals.
50,Great experience for me and my family. The staff at the mirage work so very hard. Love the customer service we felt at the mirage hotel. The hotel  Was clean and family friendly. We will be back to enjoy this place.
50,1st time staying at the Mirage and I was very impressed. Hotel was clean staff was very friendly and attentive and had a wide variety of Casino games. The have a wonderful selection of restaurants to choose from and I will definitely stay here again.
50,Great place to stay and enjoy Vegas! The pool is awesome with the waterfall and ability to order right from your chair from your phone. Clean property in a great location next to the Fashion Show mall.
40,Our trip was fun the crowd was lively and everyone seemed happy. Our room was very clean and comfy the staff members were friendly and helpful the pool was very nice & the slot machines were fun but I do miss some of the old machines. Overall we had a great time!
50,Very reasonable rates given the busy season superior conciere and front desk services; all questions answered needs provided with smiles and courtesy and professionalism. High quality amenities (restaurants; and the shows when fully operational-high variety from comedy to Cirque to magic acts)-AND MGM all work together for purposes of their loyalty program.
20,From the start it was bad. 3 rooms changes due to filthy rooms a/c not working shower drain and toilet not working dirty butt print on the sheets and dirty carpet. Just a frustrating stay and big fail.
40,There was a huge volleyball tournament along with a dance competition so it was extremely busy all over Vegas. We wish we had known. The hotel was great the room had some cleaning that could have taken place there was old food and some dead bugs that should have been vacuumed. Also mold on the bathroom door. Small problems but even still we haven’t had those issues at Excalibur Luxor or even Casino Royale.
40,Mirage has great staff and location on the strip is perfect for waking to places on the strip. Beds were comfy And rates were reasonable midweek. Hotel is showing some wear and tear. Broken tiles in the bathroom were icky.
50,We choose the Mirage for our stay because of the pool and cabanas and proximity to the Strip. We didn’t need a car while we were there. The food and service was wonderful and the staff friendly and happy to help! Our favorite pool in Las Vegas
50,Had a great time at cabana! Great service and very clean. All around great time celebrating family time and my brothers bday. Had dinner at the diner in the hotel and also ate at on of the steak houses the food was great!
50,I had a great time on the property. The hotel room and check in was great as well. We had a few rooms booked but not all booked together however the front desk was able to keep us all in the same floor which made the trip even better. I will be back to The Mirage for sure.
20,Stayed here for a volleyball tournament at the new convention center. Across the street from the monorail. Took 45 minutes door to door to get there using monorail. Ended up cabbing it after the first day. Room was fine but bathrooms are on need of an upgrade. Very small and the shower curtains are too long. Bathroom is easily flooded. One hook for towels in the entire room/bathroom but you’re strongly encouraged to reuse towels from day to day. No way for them to completely dry. I could easily live with all of that but for me the strong odor of the entire property was overwhelming. Think cigarette smoke being covered up by a glad plug-in and a vanilla vape. You could smell this from down the street about halfway past Caesar’s. Rooms smelled the same way. It made spending time on the property unpleasant especially eating there.
20,The mirage isn’t prepared for guests. I’ve been staying at MGM since the bills lost the Super Bowl. This was the most frustrating visit even during covid with all of the patricians. If you’re going to open and host large events you have an obligation to meet the expectations of food service and working computers where it relates to customer services.
50,Great location somewhat good slots. At least good cocktail service unlike at other casinos. Better than expected restaurants friendly service. Would definitely stay again! We had a friendly and prompt server at Otoro.
30,We “LOVE” the Mirage. The staff is friendly and helpful. We were disappointed with the fact some of the restaurants and coffee shops are only open during select days. Lines for coffee were much too long when only one venue was open.
50,21st and 70th and retirement trip had a great time location was very good also suites were beautiful could use some suites on valcano side pool was awesome as was service could use a couple more coffee shops and gift shops
50,Everything was perfect from the moment we booked it was our first time in Las Vegas and we chose the perfect hotel we blessed!  Check in was quick and very friendly the room was amazing view and very clean our housekeeping Maria and Milagro did an amazing job of cleaning and keeping our room organized.  True the pool is a midsummer Las Vegas mirage!  We had my special birthday dinner at Cantina Diablos and the food was delicious after we got back to our room in the elevator signaled congratulations to me I almost cried unfortunately I don't remember his name.  So all I want to say is thanks to all the amazing people who work at the hotel and make our Mirage experience an amazing experience thanks everyone!!!
10,Worst Vegas experience ever at the mirage. Lack of service as they were extremely understaffed. No food in entire hotel after 10pm. Restraints and bars closed. There is no help with luggage and room assistance. When trying to call front desk at least an hour on hold
30,The rooms and staff at the hotel was average no complaints but not really anything outstanding. My biggest issue was all of the restaurants close at 12am each night even room service!!! The casino was packed at midnight and there was no food to be found. Also there is not enough waitresses we waited for what seemed like forever between drinks (45 min plus).
50,This was definitely the best hotel on the strip. The pool was beautiful. Staff friendly. Restaurants and food were great. Room was clean. And we LOVED the Secret Garden with the Dolphins and Lion and Tigers. We will be back!
20,"The room was an ""upgrade"". Really curious to see the non-upgraded rooms. It was sold as this elaborate soaking tub with separate shower. It was a regular bathtub and a stand up 1 person shower with glass door. The door wouldn't stay shut so the floor became drenched. The glass was supposed to be clear but hadn't been actually cleaned to the point that you could not discern visually what was on the other side. The floors had crumbs all over it as well as an empty bottle. I stayed 1 night at the luxor and it was a standard room it was way nicer the my room at the mirage a much older establishment but it was clean staff was great at the mirage barely saw any at the luxor. Mirage is newer and a bit nicer looking overall but the housekeeping and room quality was not worth anything. MGM should have the same standards across all of its properties. I will definitely think twice prior to booking at MGM for awhile. As my first trip to Vegas the room was my biggest disappointment."
10,"i am a platinum member--so i have played at MGM properties all over the country a lot over the years--- look at my play!!! on this visit - i had a friend of 10 yrs with me-- i do not know what happened other then he went crazy!! drugs?? he broke the tv and a lamp in the room-- i actually called security to help me control him -- after 3 hrs of talking etc--- i was abruptly told i had to leave and NEVER return!!! I did nothing wrong---other than invite my ""friend"" to my room as i have probably 12 times over the yrs --- every other time went fine--but this time??? bad--- so why was I banned from mgm???? -- everything seemed to change direction when i admitted that i and my friend had been intimate over the yrs--- THAT was not approved of by the head security and the metro police man--- they told me that-- so--obviously MGM is NOT a very gay friendly place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
20,I used to love coming to the Mirage. First casino I ever gambled in. My how the mighty have fallen. Rooms are subpar at best no food available late night for a city that is always open management has still not fixed over charges. Doubt I’ll stay here again.
40,Hotel is nice. Pool is great. Rooms are good but beds uncomfortable. Rooms should come with a fridge that can be used by the guests to hold food and drinks. Very inconvenient to not have that standard.
30,As titled great location.  Cons: Our room door & bathroom door seemed to need an extra push/pressure to actually lock (that was scary).  Went for ice two nights in a row and there was none available. Called down to front desk and after being transferred finally got some sent up on second try. It was an hr or more later before it showed up.
20,Lackluster service. No one answers calls of any sort. The bed was AWFUL. Too bad if you have a problem is basically the response. we’ve stayed here for YEARS but we won’t return. Too many good properties to choose from.
20,The bathroom wall had a big hole in the tile. The bathroom vent fan didn't work. The shower leaked water on the bathroom floor. The bathroom mirror had blemishes. The view was not that great (a roof and a few trees). I had to check in online and in person because the parking didn't work when I checked in online only. The fridge didn't allow for cold storage and was extremely restrictive. The food at the Pantry was only okay and the table minimums were high during the week when the casino was relatively empty. The lines at the coffee shops were always long without the ability to order online and pick-up.
50,What a great time we had! I've stayed at the Mirage years ago but this trip we stayed at the MGM Grand. Not again! Our flight got cancelled so we scrambled for a room for the weekend. Mirage came through. Staff excellent distance walking to restaurants and pool excellent! Will stay again as soon as possible.
50,If u want a great pool experience and friendly staff the Mirage is the place. Dave at the Dolphin Bar at the pool makes great drinks. The mirage is centrally located on the Strip making it a very easy walk to other casinos.
50,2 bathroom sweet and great pool The pool here is huge with waterfalls and the whole 9 yards. Our suite was very clean and pretty big and had two bathrooms one with the tub one with the shower. Overall very nice hotel would stay here again.
50,If you can afford it...pay a little extra and stay at the Mirage. It is classy and beautiful. Extremely helpful and polite staff. Wonderful rooms. Pool area is magnificent. Casino clean and attractive. Stores great. A wonderful oasis.
50,Great room friendly employees awesome private pool (Oasis) where cocktails food and poolside service were wonderful. Unfortunately this visit cost us a lot because food & beverage prices were high and slot machines were too tight
50,We have stayed at the Mirage on 11 visits since 2012 each for a duration of 10-14 days. The Mirage provides the epitome of comfort amenities guest responsiveness and overall satisfaction to the degree that we always look forward to our next visit.
20,Please read the opening statement and that says everything. 1) checking issue no help from management 2) pool was dirty foggy items floating. 3) Mlife desk was very rude to me on Saturday like if I was an idiot.
40,We had an exceptional stay… great service great room and stay!!!! Through the four days we stayed my family had a great time… our room view and lay out was amazing… we had a check in issue with our room apparently the previous guest did not want to vacate the room. It was such a long drive in and I thought it was gonna take a while to resolve the issue but it was handle immediately with a different room and the rest is history!!!
30,It was a great location on the strip and the smell as soon as you walk in was amazing the room were okay nothing really to write about the walk to the room from self parking or even the front desk is a long walk I had to pay for parking even though when I booked it was free parking the pool was amazing great drinks and the snack shop inside was ok the chicken sandwich was bland
10,I was placed in the mirage suite on the 14th floor 14088. its was extremely noisy suite. you can hear the elevators moving up and down all day and night long as well as all the people getting off and on the elevator. It also tends to be spot for people to wait to get the elevator and or wait for their friends. We also had reservations at Otoro Friday night and the food was just ok. the grill food was cold when we got it and quality of the grill food and sushi was just ok. also the service was slow and our server had to many large tables to handle and forgot about us and the table across from us quite a bit.
30,My first trip ever to Vegas for a tournament and family. Awful breakfast experience at restaurant by the elevators / room was very very underwhelming / worse shower in a hotel ever / prices a bit high / pool was fantastic!
10,At first we were able to check in after we checked out at the Palazzo. We left our bags and went about our day. We didn't get back until around 1030 pm. Went to our room and found it was a king size bed instead of the double queen. The biggest issue was the flooded bathroom. Went back downstairs and advised the front desk. The only thing they could do was move us to a different room. There was not any compensation for the inconvenience (i.e. better room comped items). My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary during our trip to California with the kids. Needless to say we left the hotel immediately and returned back to the Palazzo. So much for our anniverary.
20,The room was dated. The chair by the table had stains on the arms and seat. Also the carpet was rolling up in the middle of the room which was creating a tripping hazard. I get bit by a spider in the middle of the night four times on my leg. Was not impressed at all.
40,Wife and I just got back from 3 day weekend. Mirage still is a great midrange Strip option. Pool is one of the best and casino is fun. All the bartenders and dealers were great. Rooms are the only reason I would not give it 5 stars. They are getting worn and the beds are not real comfortable. But overall still a great stay.
50,Great location. All  of the restaurants are great. All of the staff was very friendly. Rooms were very clean. The pool was very nice and relaxing. So glad to see things were back to normal again. When we go back we will definitely stay here again.
50,This was our first time staying at the Mirage. We've stayed at the Luxor and Mandalay Bay before. We absolutely LOVED the Mirage!!! We had the volcano view room and WOW! What a show!! So awesome to see it without fighting the crowd!    Pros:  Location location location  The pool looked gorgeous (we never checked it out!)  The location of our room and view  We ate at Snacks and the food was really good!  Drinks at Center Bar were yummy!!  The smell of the hotel = a tropical paradise!! Loved walking in and smelling that smell daily!!!  Rooms were clean and tidy  The Volcano show!!    Cons:  The rooms are slightly dated a refresh would be nice!  The bathroom was really small and also dated  The blow dryer was kind of crappy but next time I'll just bring my own.  Diablo Cantina wasn't open yet. :(    All in all it was the perfect trip!! We will most definitely stay here again in the future!
40,I was in Vegas in April and knew I needed to stay a couple days here when I came back in June. I got a premium Volcano room and it was awesome. Clean comfy and the view was spectatular. Their pool area is very nice too. Im sure I will be back!
50,Kevin at front desk vip check in helped my last minute decision to stay an extra night in Vegas a pleasant experience. Was uncertain where to stay and being a card platinum member at Ceasar and Gold Mlife Kevin helped that decision by providing great customer service. Great hotel with good energy and all the staff was helpful and grateful to see customer back!
10,Red mold in the showers grout shower drain clogged bathroom mirror lights burnt out hair dryer had blue sparks and sit off the circuit and the overhead bathroom lights. Furniture was dusty and carpets weren’t cleaned.
20,First of all we waited almost 2 hours to check into our room. Like all casinos they make you walk this curvy path thru all of the slot machines before you get to the elevators. The room was ok - quite worn. I forgot as non-smokers the air in the hotel always smells like smoke - no matter how much filtration they have in place. I will say the pool was enjoyable with palm trees and waterfall.
30,Need to open the restaurants as advertised. Bathrooms are small. They ran out of towels at the pool at 2pm on a Sunday. Staff is friendly and helpful thought and the hotel is clean. Shopping is minimal but that doesn’t affect me.
50,We will definitely return to this hotel. Food is excellent. Rooms are exceptional. Our entire family went and the pool was great. The location is perfect for short walk to many sights. The only bad thing I can mention is that I didn’t win a lot of money :)
10,"The Mirage is obviously trying to make back lost $ in every way possible. If you like standing in line for 20 minutes for everything from drinks to towels then definitely go here  Theree is no longer coffee in the room nor is there any kind of coffee service in the lobby. Starbucks line is consistently 20+ people long and that's the only way to get a cup. The laundry service lost our clothes and had a very ""too bad nothing I can do"" attitude and the bell desk lost some luggage and responded with the same shoulder shrug attitude. The room had no towels on arrival and it took 3 calls to get any. If you're looking for service and ease or any kind of hospitality you're better off finding a smaller hotel. If you want to jump in line with the rest of the sweaty tourists for the Disneyland version of Vegas then come here. They will happily take your money and send you on your way"
30,Mediocrity at its overpriced best. My double-double room on the 23rd floor is actually good sized especially in comparison with the king rooms I’ve seen. The staff at the front desk and in every restaurant and common area has been lovely but there are a lot of operational issues that need addressing. For example the pool has had no towels all day. The attendant told me that in the morning when they opened at 8 people were asking (and receiving) 10-20 at a time so they could save seats for friends. By 10:00 there were no towels and no chairs. There were tons and tons of coveted empty chairs being “held” with coveted towels. By 12:30 there were still no towels and the new message was “we aren’t sure there will be any more today?” If you’re charging me a $39.99 resort fee daily should there not be towels available? Or is it all a scam so that I’ll reserve the $100+ chairs? We’re here for a dance competition and there has been no ice on our floor for 2 days. Not a huge deal if I can grab it from another floor but with the security coded keys you can’t do that. After a 15 minute hold with the front desk I was offered a resort credit (nice gesture) but doesn’t help my injured dancer who needs to ice her knee after performing. Then was told that they’d credit me the cost of room service delivering ice. I appreciated that gesture as well. Then I was on hold for over 30 minutes waiting for room service and by that time she needed to leave to perform again. Each restaurant I’ve eaten at has been good though. Overall completely average.
10,My husband was using the restroom in our room when water started to fall on him from the ceiling fan and then from the light over the shower. We called the front desk and they said they were sending someone up no one ever came. Nasty sewer water falling on you no thanks. Never staying here again.
40,Wished more of the restaurants were open on Wednesdays and Thursdays but everything else was great. Pool was very nice and clean. Check-in by mobile was so easy and quick. Loved that you can use the key card or my phone to get into my room.
10,The place is outdated compared to other hotels. The suite we had smelt like a sewer leak happened in the room. Over all it’s just very dated in the room. Had a friend who stayed at the Wynn for the same price and there room was 100x nicer.
30,I've stayed at the Mirage many times. I will definitely stay there again. It's an older hotel but clean and comfortable. It's in a great location. I just wish they had a coffee maker and a few free bottles of water in the room.
20,I am a Mlife platinum card. During registration at the priority line I waited about 20 minutes without anyone asking if I need any help. After complaining to the agent in the regular registration line we still waited for about 10 minutes for someone to come out to help us with registration. There was no apology or any explanation for the delay. The agent did not ask if I had any preference and gave me a room that is farthest from the elevator. When we walk into the room there was a strong musty smell in the room. I called the front desk to request for a different room and was given a room on the 25th floor and was much nicer. With this type of treatment I just can't see myself going back to Mirage again.
10,The tower rooms are designed so that the ac air vent blows directly on the thermostat. Once the thermostat hits the desired temp it shuts off. This is what we learned from the second maintenance person we had come check out why the room was not cooling. His suggestion was that we put a towel over the thermostat. We tried that but it didn’t help much. I asked multiple people on our elevator and they had all also complained about the ac.    We got nothing for our discomfort.    If you like sweating while you sleep and sweating while you shower and dress well then this is the room for you. Otherwise avoid it at all cost.
50,Great experience lots of availability of gaming food drinks and hospitality. Haven’t stayed at the Mirage before but will definitely come again. The room was very spacious and the pool was fantastic.
10,The room i stayed in was a hospitality suite and it smelled. The building is old and the casino is very greedy. They have a bunch of 3 zero roulette games open in the morning and not a single double zero game.
30,The quality of the room with subpar subpar and the resolution could’ve been handled a little bit better the room will be replaced and was handicap it was not adequate for those that are not handicap and the outcome to resolve it was for me to pay additional for upgrade for a room that was dated from the 90s
50,This place is so friendly and love the smell when you open the door. Plus the rooms were clean and the staff anywhere I went was so friendly. So glad California Pizza was open a few days when there. See You in October.
40,Our stay was exceptional except for our room being HOT! Granted it was over 100* outside and we were on the north side of the building. I would recommend staying on the volcano side in hopes that it would be cooler. The staff was so friendly and service was great!
30,The overall quality of the property is really slipping. Forgot to clean the room one day. Curtains in the room torn and one curtain rod was broke off. Rust in bathtub. Trim ring around sprinkler head missing. They removed all of the 25 cent progressive video poker. Permanently closed the poker room. Half of the restaurants are not open during the week. None of them take reservations. I've been staying here since they opened and it's sad to see how far the quality has fallen since MGM took over.
50,Hotel was in perfect location and easy access to everything  over all staff cleanliness and everything in hotel was awesome . Very relaxing  environment was the best  pool and dolphin sanctuary was a plus .
30,Parking hell for larger vehicles. The establishment sends all over the resort for a simple need to park my vehicle at the resort I'm staying at. My sure you talk to front desk to assist with security and parking in the oversize vehicles.
50,This is the 3rd MGM property I have stayed at and by far my best experience. The room was clean comfortable and everything worked just as it should. The staff was awesome they acted like they were actually happy to be there and have me there. Even the elevators were clean! I will be booking Mirage again!
20,The room rug was dirty and smell awful the windows were so dirty the view was hard to see plus bright lights from above hitting room windows we also ask for 2 more blankets and they said no we can only get 1 Even though we had two queen beds
40,It was my first time to Vegas and I was very pleased and enticed by all of the lights and the luxury of everything that is Vegas. I reviewed all of the Covid protocols and the resort said they were open and hours listed for the various restaurants indicted they were open as well. However this was not the case. Several of the restaurants were listed as being open daily. That was a lie. California Pizza place was closed during our stay Monday until Friday. Diablo was closed Tuesday - Thursday. Very disappointed that they were listed as being open daily when that was not the case.    On one day of our trip we did a pool day. Laying out was nice and relaxing. A lot of the music played was classic rock. No issues there. The issue was the fact that the pool was ICE. COLD. It was not even pleasant to go swimming. Due to this fact we avoided the pool for a couple of days.    We went back on our last full day of the pool was much better and was able to be enjoyed. The pool was set up to release warm water every 5 minutes or so. It was much more enjoyable to layout swim and relax later during our stay.    Overall my first time in Vegas was nice. Like I mentioned it would have been nice if everything was open like they said...but it is what it is. Hopefully in the next few weeks things will be.
50,Great people food wonderful pool area and amazing service through and through!! Best weekend spent in Las Vegas thus far. It was an amazing birthday get away for all of us. We will definitely be returning!!!!
20,Don't drink the water or touch anything in the room. It will cost you $18 if you drink one bottle of water. Bring a cooler because you're not allowed to use the refrigerator. Bathrooms in the basic rooms are very small. Was not impressed. Will not stay here again.
50,Mirage was excellent. Clean rooms friendly staff. Only problem was that the majority of the shows weren’t operating yet. I really wanted to watch LOVE show which is at the mirage . That was the only disappointing part
40,Rooms and Casino where clean. Good customer Service. Good value for the days we stayed. Food at restaurant was good so was the service. Enjoyed the tiger and dolphin exhibit. Pool area was clean and relaxing
40,Ive been coming to The Mirage since the 1990s and I’m pretty sure I’ll stay here again. While not as large and showy as Bellagio Venetian and the others it boasts an excellent location and has not declined in its service. I was a little disappointed that a number of amenities are still unavailable (the “Love” Cirque show full spa buffet) but that is also the case for most other hotels as things are still not yet fully open. There were still a number of restaurants and bars available in the hotel and because of its location you are a short distance from shops Cesar’s or Treasure Island if you want other food options.    Online check in/ out at the hotel makes a very convenient stay. The staff is always friendly and flexible. The room seemed a little lax in detail (I kept finding hairs on the furniture and the curtains wouldn’t fully open) and was a little put off by some guess who brought dogs (is it necessary to bring your dog to Vegas?). These details didn’t hinder my experience however as I am very comfortable with the place and its overall service.
10,Small room’s and tiny bathrooms. No amenities. Can’t use refrigerators even to put your own stuff in to keep cold or you get charged. Room was a pain to get to. Food was a hassle. Nothing was easy there. Not even a coffee maker in the room. Too much money!
10,Room smelled like an ashtray and bong water the locks on doors didn’t work  the tub wouldn’t stay plugged  even after we had maintenance repair .  We were charged for beverages multiple times simply because my 5 year old lifted a beverage off the sensor .
40,Pool area is gorgeous and fun but not open late enough.  Many restaurants were not open which created huge crowds at the few that were open. Self check-in app was easy to use but did not tell me to create my own room card in the lobby. Parking was not as explained in the check in app. I had to pay for in/out parking throughout each day.
40,My only negative experiences were the freezing pool that was supposed to be heated and the clean but outdated rooms. I had two rooms. A king and 2 queen. Both clean but old looking. Over a year of low occupancy money should have been invested to revamp or touch up the rooms.
30,Make sure you bring a lot of money with you. Las Vegas in general is a money vacuum. They will charge you for every penny that you have in your pocket. I purposely didn’t gamble knowing that they would take my money any way possible.
50,I’d recommend The Mirage to anyone. I pretty much did everything through the MLife app so I didn’t have to come in contact with anyone. That made the experience even greater. No complaints about anything. My wife and I will definitely be back.
10,1st room dirty trash on floor behind door strong cigarette smoke    2nd room clean dog smell no hot water bathtub didn’t drain    3rd room clean smell ok water drained very very slow tv didn’t work    Staff seemed put out 0 apologizes made couples vacation after my wedding I have stayed in almost every hotel off of the strip the Mirage was by far the worst experience we have ever had. Buddies toilet needed a new ring it leaked water on flush. Other guest had backups with their plumbing. Very expensive for a 2star hotel imo.
30,Before unpacking make sure that your shower drains (mine struggled) make sure that there are towels make sure that they give you keys with access to the parking structure (unless you choose to valet). It's a decent hotel but they seem to cheap out just enough to force you to be vigilant about your amenities. The pool is great!
50,Enjoyed a nice stay at the Mirage - very centrally located on the strip still very much enjoy the volcano event nightly! My wife and I and another couple got away for a few days and loved the MLife perks at the casino and at the other casinos on the strip. Rooms were nice beds were a little worn but nice and firm - didn’t stop me from getting a good night of sleep after playing slots and blackjack into the wee hours. I still don’t like the smoke in casinos - but that seems to be the norm in Vegas.
50,This hotel has everything you need. It is clean and staff is awesome. Casino was not smokey and was able to walk back and forth with no smoke issue. There are numerous restaurants on site. Plenty of elevators so you don't have a long wait.
40,Pool was to cold restaurants closed had to go different casino for service room service not available hopefully next time we’re in Vegas things will be different I don’t know if I ll go back to Mirage
50,The hotel staff was attentive the location of the hotel is perfect and walkable to everything. The rooms were immaculate and the views are breath taking we were lucky enough to have Mountain View and strip view. We will definitely return to the mirage
30,Rooms were worn with stains and in need of improvement.    No electrical sockets near the beds for charging mobile phone.    Bathroom door hook broken and shards of wood exposed.    Only one towel discovered when getting out of the shower.    I did like the mobile check in however it would be nice if the mobile key card could be added to Apple wallet.    Parking was great for pearl mlife members and the baggage storage on the last day was a breeze.    This was our second stay in the the same week different rooms but both rooms had several signs of wear with stains on the carpets and chairs.
20,The room was not up to par in my opinion. Stayed in a stay well room and the rooms white noise device did not work and the air filtration system was dirty. No ice machine on my floor the first night. The restaurants were not open late past 10pm and some of them were not even open at all.
30,Very limited food available at the Mirage and what's available after 3:pm is horrendous. Not to mention no food at all after 10pm...  The Mirage can and has done way better.  Extremely disappointed!  The floor and maid staff were exceptional!
40,Service was great though some bars and restaurants had short operating hours. Looks  Like some maintenance needs to be done on the grounds. Our room was a little dingy and had a clogged sink and shower but maintenance quickly resolved the area. Pool was packed each day so arrived early
30,One of my favorite places to stay - in the past. Won’t stay again. Had a Comp room we were on 3rd floor with view of a cement wall.  Very little open for meals- and prices outrageous. We went elsewhere and found great meals at reasonable prices.  Digital key stopped working 1st night—- tired but all the way back down to Registration for a real key..  Just not what it used to be — now mediocre.
40,Room is a bit dated but comfy enough for our needs. Fridge is full of overpriced items and they charge you $50 if you put a bottle of water inside. The early check in and late check out was convenient although the maid knocked on our door to ask when we were leaving. No one was at the rental car kiosk so we used Treasure Island for that. The casino was smoky and restaurants had limited hours. We won a few hundred at the games so that felt generous compared to other places.
30,I stayed in a one bedroom suite. I tried checking in early and was told suite wasn't ready and cleaned. Come back between 3-4(OK I can get room not fully ready that early.) I didn't get in my room until at least 6.Table was dirty. no garbage bags. All around staff were pretty nice tho. Pool is awesome. Bed was comfy.
10,This was my second time at the Mirage the first was it was nice…this time not so much. Everything seems to be headed down hill. The rooms are showing their age and ours smelled like smoke when you turned on the bathroom fan. The pool was overly crowded. You had to get in line about an hour before they opened so you had a chance of getting a decent seat. All of the covered seats were reserved a week ago and there was only 1 waitress managing the whole area the first 2 hours! The water was FRIGID! Very few adults were actually in the pool because it was so cold. It was 115 and the water was just too cold to bear! The restaurants are closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays so that was frustrating. And then the majority of the tables were closed. They had 1 Craps table the entire time we were here! We ended up at Caesar’s and had a much better gambling experience there. Same with restaurants. I guess Mirage is getting good at sending business to other places with how poorly things are being run. Lastly both the check-in and check-out process involved a lengthy wait. There were multiple clerks standing around but no one seemed concerned about how long the line was! It’s sad the Mirage used to be a happening place but not anymore. We will go back to Bellagio it’s just on a totally different level than the Mirage. Overall I say don’t waste your time go somewhere else!
50,I spent two nights at the Mirage in June 2021. The customer service was outstanding! The room was great the bed was very comfortable and highly recommend getting a view of the volcano! The only negative was the bathroom was very small but functional. They also have a Dolphin/Tiger show! Some of the restaurants are still not open during the week. Overall had a fantastic stay at the Mirage and highly recommend!
30,First the positive. It is clear that the staff is much more friendly than in the past. Someone up top finally got the memo.  However The Mirage is simply in decline. The action in the casino is limited especially early in the week. Very few open tables and most gamblers are newbies. For those inclined to play a hopping craps table you are out of luck. The poker room has been turned into a smoke-free slot room. They have no plans to open a new one. The room was ok not terrible in any way. But a cigarette smell was coming from the vent in the bathroom and smelled bad. If you compare a Bellagio room however it is a no contest.  If you want ANY shade at the pool there are about 10 chairs total. All reserved spots (which are impossible to get) have canopies but none others. Also if you want any chance for good seats get in line at least an hour early and wait. Pool opens at 9am. In addition you may want a coffee while you wait as I did it’s another 45 min wait. One coffee bar in that entire area always slammed.  Finally and worst of all they shut down three or four of their restaurants on Tuesday and Wednesday eve. Unbelievable lol. A casino full of your guests and you are making them go to other casinos to enjoy a nice dinner? Simply ridiculous.    Mirage used to get 5 star reviews. No longer deserved. Learn from Bellagio or turn into Treasure Island...  We will not return.
50,We had the best food at every restaurant! From pool side chicken tenders to breakfast sandwiches at Snacks to classic steak dinner at Heritage Steakhouse. The pool was amazing. Loved the Mojito’s Dave made us at the Dolphin Bar. Cant’t wait to return.
20,I guess there is no such thing as Covid?? I read that Vegas had put into effect all these cautions as a result of Covid: having plastic dividers closing every other machine etc. The only thing I witnessed was dealers wearing masks and a few hand sanitizer machines in the casino. All Machine are on and taking your money to recoup the last year losses. I am very surprised after a road trip from Boise to Salt Lake City to Vegas this is the only hotel without having Covid safe cleaning methods noted. No deal on the door l no mention of a deeper cleaning as a result of the virus still lingering. The only thing different is a complete lack of service! Try calling down to the front desk because your key does not work better yet walking down for a replacement and no M Life elite line open at 10 pm only to find a line 20 people deep trying to check in.
40,The hotel looks very very good outside and has gorgeous lobby and all that - it's just so cool to be inside and outside. But as soon as you enter elevator you enter 00's or maybe even 90's. Low ceilings dark style interior dusty corners.  We had two queen volcano view room. It's spacious with old furniture which doesn't really spoil your vacation. I dont like the suicide style windows so you gotta be very careful with what you have in your hands especially keep an eye on your kids. Always! Or just keep the windows shut.  We were on the 20th floor but I wish we would stay much higher - the light projectors facing the hotel give great light pollution and spoil the volcano experience from you room.  Thу very best part of this hotel is the pool - probably the best pool in the whole Vegas area! Its big and have lots of palms. All photos there are great because all you see is great - palms stones hotels. There are no other hotels disrupting the view on the background.
50,It was a great time to see Vegas getting back to Normal. Mirage was very clean and busy. Check in was a breeze and quick. Overall stay was excellent and rooms were great . Restaurants were busy and of course having Starbucks in the casino is always appreciated.
20,Room was outdated. Room was not clean upon arrival. Fridge was not working. Trash was left behind cardboard boxes of beer. Living room furniture was old stained with rips in the coach pillows. Not worth the price they trying to sell you on.
50,Great stay clean room. Pool was great. Front desk staff very helpful. Will stay again. Know that not all food choices are open during covid. Snacks restaurant has great sandwiches. Know that they’ll be a wait for any restaurant
20,Room smelled like marijuana. When I called the front desk they were not able to change my room. Although they gave me credit for 1 day of resort fee they also said that they will send someone to my room but no one came. We had to find a hotel maid for a spray which was not effective anyway. We had to go across the street to but an aerosol spray and had you air out the room by opening the window.
30,The variety of slots were lacking. All the popular slots you find at other MGM casinos were not here. We took our cash elsewhere. Now the 100% smoking floor is disgusting. You no longer get the fresh tropical smell I associated with The Mirage. Also Resort King rooms my go to are showing their age. Canceled my room for my November trip and booked a renovated room at Luxor for half the price. Maybe I'll go with The Park who has really stepped up.
50,Had a fantastic time. Wish it could have been longer. Great location and next to all the good spots. Can’t wait to be able to go again and take the baby. Awesome food and music inside casino! Also great slots
50,Love The Mirage. We always have a positive experience when we stay here. Rooms are nice & clean. Staff is wonderful and the pool is absolutely beautiful. This time we had a comped room through My Vegas which we thought would be maybe a older shabby room but no. It was the same room we always book. Definitely recommend.
50,Stayed for a business trip and highly recommend this property for families friends and colleagues alike. The staff made every experience easy and enjoyable. Everyone was so friendly from check in to check out.
50,We stayed at The Mirage a fave of mine due to casino and location on May 2 -4th for a 2nd mini honeymoon. Ive always loved that its next door to Cesar's  across from my fav Fat Tuesday's (with the vodka red bulls) and across from the Venetian and walgreens. Everything I need. We used the contact less check in and thru the app were alerted our room was ready and a virtual key. We had no problems with virtual the first day but the second day we had to go down and get a plastic key.  Rooms are the same and comfy and ok lit. Had a view of the volcano and you could hear that thing rumble! Didn't bother us at all was pretty cool actually.  Have always loved the Pantry and even if not staying there we tend to go to breakfast there its that Good!!!!  As always if you want a decent stay with good location and some loose slots stay here!
40,We stayed 5 nights. It is clean family friendly and the main pool is paradise! The only complaint I have is the hidden deposit upon check in. I had to put a one night stay deposit down upon reserving online. I paid resort fees and taxes at check in along with the remaining balance then was asked to pay a 200.00 incidental deposit that was not disclosed any where on my reservation before arriving. I was told by desk employee that all the resorts do this. It should be listed on reservation. Otherwise we enjoyed the hotel and offerings. The restraints within hotel are a bit expensive so would recommend eating else where. We spent 60.0 on three yogurts from yogurt shop. Spent 5.00 on a small cup of soda ouch!!! Would not do that again. Oh also do not touch the items the hotel tempts you with in your room. They will cost you a pretty penny! - The dolphin habitat is very cool too!
40,The Mirage stands as one of the older properties on the Strip; however its manicured grounds and waterfalls as well as its noticeably well maintained hotel and casino make this a definite consideration for your stay in Vegas.    Rarely in today's world will you find the common areas and individual rooms of a hotel free of debris on the floor; the Mirage is the exception. Everywhere was meticulously clean. The rooms are nice and adequate in size with updated and somewhat small bathrooms. The only issue that we had during our stay was with the rather lengthy and arduous check-in process. Also as a result of a mistake made by the desk clerk on our check-in we were unable to charge to our room multiple times despite having a credit card on file and food & beverage credit per our booking with MGM. Each time we either had to go back to the front desk or plead our case with restaurant/front desk staff via phone. It became very frustrating over our four-night stay.
40,I stayed at the Mirage from May 16-20 for four nights. It's in a great location and I had a Volcano View room on the 20th floor in room #20037 which has a great view of the Las Vegas Strip. I liked my room very much which was very comfortable and lots of space. I also enjoyed many of the amenities the hotel offers including quick service eateries bars/lounges as well as The Secret Garden and casino. The hotel staff was very helpful when I needed them and particularly at the M Rewards desk on the first day as I needed to apply some rewards to my account.    All was good until the final night.    I returned to the hotel and did some gambling in the casino after returning from the Cosmopolitan for dinner. When I returned to my room around 12:30 am on May 20th I discovered my carry on travel bag was missing. I know I had made sure the room was locked before going out earlier. I went downstairs and found a member of the security staff Luis who came up to my room to question me.    I told Luis the bag was left on the bed and tried to recall what was missing from it. I gave him a total of about $200 in items missing not including the value of the bag. I would recall more items missing as I thought about it the next morning. It will cost me about $400 to replace all of these items.    Another member of security Ramon came up to take down an official statement from me. They told me they'd report this to the hotel and I'd should hear from them by tomorrow. This was also the day I was flying home. They also gave me a $25 gift card to use in the hotel for eateries etc. The security staff was fine but couldn't do much for me.    Not sure if this was an inside job or an outsider. I'm glad most of my valuables were in the room safe or on me.    The security in these hotels needs to be improved as anyone can walk on to an elevator and break into a room if they know what they are doing. You have to have a room key to go to a floor but you can just get off on a floor that someone had already chosen. Other resorts like the Hilton Elara you have to scan your room key with a member of security before getting on. Much more secure!    After arriving home days went by and I hadn't heard from the Mirage yet. I emailed guest services and they responded immediately. They told me to call the Mirage's Risk Management. I have called them several times over the past couple of weeks and have yet to hear back from them.    I wish I'd get a response from them and see what they can do for me as I took the precautions with the safe and making sure my room was locked when leaving. This was not my fault and a violation on me. I just didn't expect it even though this occurs a lot in Las Vegas.    Other than this I enjoyed my four nights at the Mirage very much. I would like to return there but I would need an assertion that I'd be safe when staying there in the future as well as when I lock my room.
50,A great stay! Room was clean and close to the elevators which we like. Power went out in the bathroom our last night there but we didn’t even care. We had an early flight to catch the next morning so I just told them about it at checkout. I assume they fixed it. Reserved seating at their pool was awesome and that alone may bring me back here thr next time we visit. Dealers and floor managers in the casino are terrific — knowledgeable about the games of course but also friendly and funny! We will definitely be back.
20,Where do I begin? First off the suite shown in the picture is NOTHING like what you are getting in real life. Our family stayed in an “accessible 2 bedroom suite” advertised with a strip view. Unfortunately we got a view of the freeway and apparently non of the accessible suites have strip views. False advertising. Our room was so beat up inside it was ridiculous. The couch had a massive sink hole the bed faced a giant ugly tv that stayed at the foot of your bed (unable to go down) and so much more. The pool was great and the service was great but the room really killed our family trip. I would recommend staying elsewhere.
10,"The rooms are badly beaten down. Every piece of furniture is worn and dirty the drapes are unraveling and the rooms reek of cigarette smoke. There was a rust stain in the bathtub and none of the shower heads are adjustable. The lines to check in are the longest I've ever seen and the staff seems to hide from the guests. I waited 20+ minutes in a priority line listening to a manager explain to the couple behind me how much ""these girls"" loved him because he bought them manicures. Then when the line didn't move fast enough he got a check-in manager from the back to open a new window and took his buddies past me and straight to check-in. When I loudly complained he wouldn't even look at me. I had to wait another 10-15 minutes before someone was free to help me. Some of the restaurants are closed and those that are open have lots of empty tables - because they don't have enough wait staff. The line for the pool at 9 am was 100+ people. There was only one person working at the coffee shop. No one seemed to care - they all just seemed to be keeping their heads down so no one noticed them. Worst hotel experience ever."
30,The mirage is a beautiful hotel and in a good location.    Staying for 5 nights we knew we could take advantage of taking it steady in the hot heat.    Vegas atm is crazy busy and Uber’s are all working on prime time rates.    Overall the hotel got a 3 star from me due to the following bellow.    •Stupidly overpriced food and drinks compared to other hotels on the strip.  •No shade around the pool unless you can nab some beds near the dolphin bar.  •rooms are very small and bathrooms tiny  •most the restaurants are still closed and limited drink attendants on the floor.  •tight slots  •AC in rooms can be hot or miss. We had a miss and got moved.  •$28 for a 32oz Daiquiri    Things that we liked    •The free upgrade to the living well floor (tip your desk clerk $20) they will look after you with complimentary upgrade.  •The casino floor has unreal air purifiers and you don’t smell smoke at all.  •friendly staff  •good house keeping  •clean  •location  •pool is nice and cool  •gardens are amazing    Overall a fun stay.
20,"What a difference this hotel was from the last time we stayed here pre-pandemic. Our ""free upgrade"" (that was forced on us due to our later arrival and them over-selling our room type) landed us right next to an ice machine and an elevator in a room that was in desperate need of updating. The service was terrible to the point I almost want to use the word discrimination at one of the bars where I was overlooked for an extended amount of time while later arrivals were helped first. The ventilation also seemed to be lacking on this trip and there were more than a normal amount of slot machines requiring or being serviced.    It gets two stars still for a couple of reasons: we have great luck with dealers and their personalities playing here the front desk staff is very friendly and the security team were a hoot to deal with when we (and they) couldn't get our safe open upon arrival."
30,the mattresses are like sleeping on concrete enter connecting room doors that other people try to get into your room. the toilet sounds like a shotgun when you flush it very very very loud for a toilet and the staff acts all put out if you need anything
40,The rooms need an update but the suites have some the best views. I just wish the stupid Beatle's sticker on the building wasn't there. Mirage needs to take it down so that the suites could have an unobstructed view of the strip.    RON
50,Staff were great easy to check in and check out love there casinos. Rooms are very clean. Was given an extra hour to check out as a complimentary since my flight was leaving at a later time plus I was able to leave my luggage with the bell desk after we checked out was very convenient for us
30,Good central location friendly staff. Sadly the rooms of The Mirage have seen their share of wear & tear and are in desperate need of a face lift/up-grade. Constant odor of marijuana within the hotel floors also got quite old. This is not the Mirage I knew just a few years ago.
50,Our stay was very enjoyable. The staff were very helpful and kindly answered all of our questions. We had a very nice time at the casino and had a couple of great meals at Otoro and Costa. Will definitely come back.
50,The entire experience was great from checking in to checking out and everything in between. Rooms were nice and clean. The only thing was lots of noise in the we hours ... singing talking loud but than it’s vegas  right ! Happy happy times . Thank you so much for all that was done at this busy time  everyone seemed happy to be back in
20,Wait and wait for everything from checking in to getting a coffee. The entire non smoking floor smelled like a snoop dog concert every night. The mattress was worn to slopping like a hammock. Overpriced necessities if you happened to forget anything.
10,We were not told about incidentals charges of $100 per day. We had to fight to get parking charges covered as we were told there would not be any when we booked. Rooms do not have coffee pots. We had to either order a box for $15 or wait in a long line and pay $15 per cup. Our room did not have an alarm clock or towels. When we got towels they were stained. We asked for four and only got three. We ordered room service and let them know we had a dairy allergy. They still sent a build your own omelette smothered in cheese.
50,Highly recommend the Mirage. Wonderful staff great rooms with views of the Strip and excellent casino. I especially loved the Pantry Restaurant. Food is amazing and staff very personable. My casino host always provide wonderful service and support. Thank you.
50,Got a penthouse for a week for my husband’s birthday. Had a great experience from check in to check out and everything in between! Valet was amazing as well! Only issue I had was with Bare pool. 5 star
50,As Mlife members we have stayed at Mirage numerous times over the years. We checked in on Sunday the 29th for 4 nights; even though it was the middle of Memorial weekend we were able to check into a standard King room on the 21st floor right away at mid-afternoon. Liked that the elevators are segregated by floor groupings with key access for security so never a long wait.    Our room was clean upon arrival and we opted for daily housekeeping. Housekeeping did a great job getting the room serviced while we were out and leaving clean towels. Shoutout to this hard working staff! Because of prior stays we knew no fridge in room so we were prepared with sodas & water bought prior to our arrival.    Made reservations for breakfast at the Pantry several weeks prior to arrival and were seated on time; good portions and great choices.    I also had reservation for 2 loungers & umbrella at the Private Oasis Adult OnlyPool. Really enjoyed our day here. The servers and pool staff were very friendly and helpful. Used my $50.00 RC here on food/drinks. I consider this money well spent to not have to line up an hour ahead of time plus have some shade to make the day more enjoyable. I would have spend the price of the loungers and food/drinks gambling or shopping so no complaints here.    The resort location is fantastic. Mid-strip and easy walk to more food and fun. I agree with other reviewers that the rooms are ready for a refresh. It will be nice once staffing is back to pre-Covid levels and more restaurants buffets and food options can be available. It was a challenge but I knew to expect this before arriving.    Tips - Private Oasis Pool - you can check with them ahead of time and if they have availability they can move you from your pre-assigned spot to another one. Also - the Avis representative at the Mirage quit showing up to work about a week before our arrival; we had some difficulty returning our rental car as our drop off location was the Mirage but we finally got this straighten out with Avis - not the hotels fault and hopefully a new rep is already in place.    All in all - another great stay at Mirage.
50,The mirage is right in the middle of the strip. It’s a good place to stay in with lots of food options I never have any issues when I go there it’s always a great place to be. I don’t see myself staying any where else
50,When it comes to Las Vegas The Mirage is still one of the most enjoyable hotel/casinos to visit and stay at. Great rooms great games and fantastic restaurants. I've been staying here since 1991 and will keep returning again and again.
50,Property was clean. Employees very friendly. Great time. Housekeeping was very good. We called for towels they brought them with no delay. This was late in the day. We went out and our room was done when we came back without asking and this was later in the day. Very impressed.
50,Enjoyed the pool room location of the casino on the strip and had a nice casino floor layout with friendly staff. Check in was nice and easy and the Mlife desk was very nice and able to assist with getting set up
50,A great hotel and casino. Great restaurants. You’ll love it here. Really a nice place. Great helpful staff. Great location on the strip. Enjoy a sandwich and I mean a sandwich that will fill you up and so good at Stacks in hotel.
50,it was the best stay me and my family had here in Vegas the service was great the room was clean and comfortable the pool was very nice but closed a little to early and the dolphin show was very cool and the kids loved it
50,Made our annual visit to Vegas to meet friends. No problems during stay which is unusual for several large high-occupancy hotels. Parking was easy and free because of military member’s club. Check-in was fast with pre-registration. It is a bit of a walk to the elevators but not a problem. Room was exactly what I requested and was very clean. Security safe in room was a nice feature. Elevator access to rooms is security controlled with room key.  Bunches of slot machines and table games! Did miss a few of my old favorite games such as Lobstermania…  Food was good but VERY expensive. Be prepared. Noticed several folks eating at chain restaurant across the street and going to nearby convenience store for food.  Overall an excellent experience!
30,We have always enjoyed staying at the Mirage several times a year but our most recent experience was not as good as what we have previously had. Next time we visit Vegas we intend to look for a different property.
50,A wonderful stay at The Mirage - comfortable and clean and almost back to a full opening. Due to worker shortages a few restaurants were closed and seating at gaming tables was a premium. However it did not stop us from having a great time.
20,The room we stayed in was filthy outdated and absolutely disgusting. Was not worth the money we paid especially for an upgraded volcano view room. My friends and I did not feel comfortable staying there and would not do it again.
40,The only reason will not get 5 stars will be because of instead of a regular fridge they had a full weight bar fridge besides already having items on top of the counter. That’s being greedy. Put a regular fridge instead of that and it will be 5 stars.
50,Everything was amazing in the hotel from the front desk team bell desk team housekeeping maintenance cashiers for the casino all the way to the restaurant staff in the hotel. The pool staff was amazing too. Y’all book with The Mirage Hotel & Casino because they won’t let you down!!!!!
40,Mirage is beautiful and tons of fun. Perfect location on the strip. Too many kids in the pool kill the vibe. Late night dining options are limited. Rooms are nice but but only average. Nothing outstanding. Fun place for gambling and getting drinks.
40,Room was clean shower and commode backing up. Resort was nice but pot smell from several rooms on floor stunk badly. A couple rude bartenders. Homeless people inside and outside. Overpriced drinks at the pool. Probably last time to mirage/vegas
50,It was an amazing stay!! Milly was amazing and put me in a room with a view of volcano for my birthday!! I will never forget this experience. Definitely one of the best trips to Vegas I have ever taken!!!
50,The rooms were very nice the casino is super nice and clean. We were able to check in early so we didn’t have to check our bags in anywhere. You have the option to check in completely on line and a station to make your own room keys which I personally loved the convenience of. I was super impressed with our stay here!
20,Room was dirty lacked basic set of towels bath mat was tattered and lotion on bathroom counter was already used. Breakfast of eggs 3 bacon grease laden toast greasy fried pieces of unseasoned potatoes and small coffee with 2% milk (had no creamer!) was $29.00 for being picked up myself. Took 15 minutes to get out of garage because exit bar kept breaking.
30,They handled the issues could have been a big problem. It was late. I was very tired. I appreciate the quick action and service. It could have been a big deal if no rooms were available. I will be back.
50,Spent a couple of nights just for a personal trip. The Mirage seems to be a good place for families and those looking for a friendly/easy pace to stay. Pool area and general amenities were great. Seems to be a hotel that is not overly crowded—which I appreciated greatly.
50,The Mirage is a great hotel in Vegas! Tropical feel great rooms; easy to get around; clean; fantastic location; a couple of restaurants were only open a few days a week but overall good food selection.
30,No pool after 5pm? No room service? So we m8ust go to Walgreens to get a snack?  Not right in anyone's world. The general cleanliness is suspect. At least there could be a bottle of FREE water in the room.
40,1st time staying at Mirage I’d probably stay here again but I’m going to have to do a different research next time as it seems that only 2 of their restaurants were open during our stay both of which were their more casual places. That might have been a bit more acceptable had there been a pop up letting guests know that their nicer places weren’t open. Room service ended early all 3 nights of our stay. So for pretty much every meal we had to hit the strip to look for a restaurant that was open. I mentioned it somewhere else but I’ll do it again. A daily resort fee of $44.95 was tacked on our total bill which ordinarily is never a problem but this trip I really did have a problem because I can’t see what my resort fee was going to. It certainly couldn’t be for the really weak WiFi . I don’t know  maybe I’m not as in favor of Mirage as I thought I was.
50,The staff is great so friendly and kind. The only “complaint” I have would be the pillows being too soft which personally made sleeping all night a little uncomfortable but that was nothing major at all. Other than that it was a pleasant stay.
20,The first room I had was an accessible room and it smelled like a nursing home. The second room had rust in the tub no refrigerator no coffee pot dust buildup on the carpet along the walls and ceiling by the window is damaged.
40,The hotel location on the strip led to easy travel to and from to other hotels and attractions. The burgers at snacks were very good. The pool was very popular so it was hard to find a good to space to enjoy the water but it calmed down in the early morning.
50,The Mirage is a Great place to stay in Las Vegas. Centrally located across from the Venetian and Wynn. It's close to the Fashion show mall. Great restaurant in the Mirage We had a really good breakfast at the Pantry and coffee is really good at the Roaster.
10,The rooms are very small compared to other competitive hotels for the money. The pool had limited seating in the adult pool was a joke as it was very very small. The food that still bar was not worth the money either. Decent quality but the portions were a joke. I ordered the chicken wings and had to go somewhere else for dinner. Not going back
30,Hotel did not accommodate a promo that I was offered. Caused me several more hundred dollars on top of other fees I did not anticipate. Room had a slight odor that was not pleasant but not intolerable.
40,I rented a scooter from a 3rd party vendor and went to the bell desk to pick it up and then I found out that I needed to be at the hotel for the pickup and drop-off of my scooter. Extremely annoying. You used to be able to have the scooter dropped off at the bell desk but no more!
10,Was.provided a medical refrigerator that emitted heat instead of cold so ruined my diabetic meds. Safe was non functional. Was told that upgraded for free to pool view but the assigned room was parking lot.
50,Our first time staying at The Mirage and we will now be back forever. This place is special and we could not have been happier with everything. Great venue with plenty of food options dolphin and tiger experience and great vibe!
40,Nice hotel & great view from our room.  Kids loves playing in the pool .  Great location and will stay again  Highly recommendecfor family with children.  All staffs are friendly and very helpful.  Kudos! to all employees
50,We have been staying at The Mirage for over 16 years. The pool area exceptional service and fun & interesting dining options keep us coming back. I will say that the rooms are in desperate need of updating. Our 1 bedroom penthouse suite was sad & tired. Missing a television just a hole on the wall barstools....We use our M Life benefits and are huge fans of this property. Please update those rooms!
40,The Mirage is an old favorite for me. I hadn't stayed there in 15 years and now I typically defer to Aria.    The best aspect on this trip was the people. So kind and courteous - check-in housekeeping dealers cage staff cocktail waitresses folks at the Still and California Pizza Kitchen - all wonderful.    Also of positive note - the rooms and the hotel in general are clean and comfortable. Restaurant selection is adequate. The location is great because if you don't find what you want the Caesars Forum Shops (mall) is maybe a 75 yard walk.    Only negatives were the operations aspect of the cage (Cashier) and the operations of the cocktail service.    The Cashier area often had a line and there seemed no urgency to move people through who simply wanted to cash their chips. I was in line for a casino credit application which took 30 minutes due to a printer issue. Again the team was so courteous and I was not in a great rush but many were inconvenienced by this.    The cocktail service was extremely slow particularly in the Sports Book. Often 45 minutes between visits.    I consider these to be minor negatives and they certainly didn't change my positive opinion of the hotel and their team.    I did not get a chance to visit the pool or the gym - but I remember them both being of nice quality and very enjoyable.    I would definitely recommend a stay here whenever you find a good price for the rooms!
10,I had many problems in my stay first the check in process from the moment I arrived at the counter it took over 30 minutes. The person who was helping didn’t know anything I asked basic questions about parking and she had to go to the back to ask someone else. The worst part is that they gave me someone’s else’s room and when I went up to the room I woke them up and went into their room thankfully they were understanding and things didn’t go out of hand. After I went back to the counter and ask to speak to a manager the person in charge wanted to gave me the phone number to call next morning I had to insist. I did speak to Matthew a manager and he made some arrangements that made my stay a little better but I had already ruined my trip in the first night.
20,Our view was the roof- not very nice. The room could use updating. There really wasn’t any outlets or anything close to the bed to plug your phones into. The room was clean and the check-in process was simple. Very standard room- felt like we were staying at a holiday inn not a nice Vegas resort. Doubt we’ll stay here again.
40,This hotel was large with two sinks and two closets perfect for a couple. Also a large deep bath to relax after a day of drinking and gambling. The pool is large with beautiful waterfalls and trees. Centrally located on the strip!
50,We absolutely loved everything about The Mirage! Exceptional service clean everywhere!!!! Sports bar staff is wonderful! Pool was the best! Lots of room and clean and well kept. The Mirage grounds are immaculate!
30,The Mirage has a beautiful pool. The volcano is very cool. Nice casino and beautiful gardens. Rooms could use some updating. Restaurants are overpriced. Staff was ok but you could tell there was a staff shortage.
50,My visit was for my daughter's wedding and I had an Awesome strip view it was Awesomely clean love the huge aquarium in the lobby. sufficient safety precautions were in place. I've recommended the Mirage to my family and friends
40,Mirage took care of us very well on our recent stay. After some difficulty trying to download the app to check in Landon at the front desk took care of us and got the problem resolved quickly. The food was good the pool was fun and the bed was very comfortable!
50,This was my second stay at the Mirage and we absolutely love it here. It's great location on the strip short walk to the Bellagio or the Linq area. The check in process was easy and quick I used the mobile app to save some time and it worked well. The room was clean and spacious. The casino environment is lively and the casino space is well maintained and clean. Great choices of restaurants located inside the resort as well. The pool was very busy but we were able to find seats. Bar service in the casino is great too. Bartenders are friendly and quick with the drinks! Would recommend to any one looking for a great Vegas experience.
50,Place it located right on the strip loved the views and the pool area was wonderful. Love the food also the casino was awesome I hit 5k my first night. Amazing experience. This was my fist time in Vegas
40,My sister and I decided to treat ourselves to the 2-bedroom tower suite instead of getting comped. The suite was gorgeous. But be aware that the suites are on lettered floors so if you do mobil check in and get floor 26-31 it will actually be A-E. Mobil check in does not explain this so when I couldn’t find my elevator I had to go back to front desk wait in line for 30 minutes to learn about this weird system. Also even though we had a suite we did not get a coffee maker or microwave. I’m sure this is a COVID issue but then there should be some sort of discount on the room. Instead we had to get a $15 box of coffee from room service. We went on 6/1 the first day that Vegas went to 100% service. However it was clear that they were understaffed and unless you had reservations well in advance there was no getting into restaurants. Hopefully this will change as things go back to normal. This was the case throughout the Strip. We spent one morning looking for breakfast and the lines were crazy. We finally opted for the food court at the Venetian and got there just before everyone else did. The Pantry at the Mirage does offer room service and we chose to do that twice as the food was great.
10,If you love walking a long ways to stand in long lines and paying double for good food then this is for you. The Dolphin ticket guy won't let us in without a photo ID even after he looked up our reservation and verified who we were. I couldn't find breakfast without crossing the street. There were no shows. Imagine a cruise ship then imagine the opposite experience. This was the opposite experience across the board. I'm hard pressed to think of why I'd return.
50,It was a cool place to go to. To bad that the cravings was not open if not it would of been way better. Also see some lady get arrested and not sure what was the drama but thanks hope to stay again. But yeah.
20,This was our first family vacation since Covid. We were very excited in getting away but disappointed in the room. I booked a room on the Stay Well floor because I am highly sensitive to the smell of smoke. The room advertised an air purification system but it did nothing. The smell gave me a horrible headache and wheezing. I also found a pair of dirty socks covered in dog hair in a drawer from a previous guest. The bathroom sink also had a strong mold smell. We only stayed 2 nights and made the best of it. The volcano show also had technical difficulties so did not run and our celebration dinner at Heritage Steak took us 2.5 hr because the kitchen was so backed up. This would have been doable if we didn’t have kids with us who were starving. We got an apology and a comped dessert from the manager which I felt was not sufficient. We stayed at another hotel in Henderson too and a common theme we saw are that the hotels/bars/restaurants are understaffed but are still taking full bookings. I will not stay at the Mirage again as there are plenty of other options on the strip.
50,I loved the location of the hotel and how conveniently located the rooms were to the casino and strip. The pool wasnt too crowded even though it was the beginning of summer break. Overall my experience was fabulous and will definitely be staying again.
50,Clean place. Friendly staff. Restaurants are all great. Secret garden is awesome. Pool area is nice and completed with cocktail service. Casino floor is laid out great. Makes it easer then most to find members of your party after being separated
30,Booked the Penthouse Suite for my girlfriend’s birthday thinking it would be exactly what we both wanted. Boy was I wrong. The room we stayed in definitely was not the room that is shown on the MGM website. I booked this room primarily for the strip view I thought I would be receiving. I got a great view of the mountains and a tiny bit of the northern strip. I called immediately about this but couldn’t have my room changed because they were supposedly all booked up. They did offer to switch me on the last night we were there if I’d pay an extra $150 for a lower floor room. No thanks! There were also issues with the amenities of the room itself too many to list. All in all I just felt like I got duped. It won’t be happening to me again.
50,It was a clean hotel with really friendly staffs. I will definitely recommend to all my family and friends to stay here especially if they have little kids. The casino was the right size. It wasn't too big or small.
50,We had the absolute best experience here! We come to Vegas every year for our anniversary and usually stay at the Luxor. This year we thought we would change it up. I do believe that we will be staying here every year now! From check in to the casino to the restaurants to the pool to the Secret Garden and little shops the staff was of the most excellent quality and the friendliest I have ever encountered! Can't wait to go back!!!!!!
50,Beds were super comfy! Digital check in and check out was so awesome. Loved the digital keys. Pantry had amazing food! We would definitely stay again. The pool had an amazing scenery and was super relaxing. Love the pool bar choices
30,If the title doesn't say it then know this. Vegas is no longer customer-focused. Everything is way overpriced and they nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING. The refrigerator in the room is only for their overpriced items and you'll get charged $50 for using it for your own items?!? but at least their drinks are watered down and overpriced. And if you're planning on gambling you better be rich! $25 min on most table games and perks don't seem to exist. If you're looking for a fun time head over to Fremont street where people know how to party in Old Vegas.
50,12 of us celebrating our Daughters 21st B'day! We had a Suite and 3 other rooms they made sure we were on the same floor and close to each other. it was a great time with Family and the Mirage Staff is amazing. The Pool is awesome and a reason we come back every year.
40,Nice place expensive room service though. Also no microwave or fridge. Room rates are good Pool was nice. Pretty clean and updated large casino nice staff they charge for valet now which is no good.
50,Outstanding reception at Check In Desk. Fast friendly and efficient service at pool side cabana. Was in Las Vegas for a Military Reunion and had a great time at this Property. All staff members were extremely friendly and helpful.
40,The Mirage is a good/clean resort with friendly staff. Overall experience was great. The mirage is also in a good location on the strip for walking. The one thing I would say about the mirage is that there isn’t anything special that puts it above the rest.
20,Penthouse was not ready when we arrived at 4pm. Had to wait an extra hour only to have a maintenance man there for an additional 30min. Room was not with the view I had requested. I didn't get a penthouse so I could look at rooftops a freeway and railroad tracks or to be baked in the 5pm setting sun. The room was subpar...not enough drawer space in the main bedroom and light switches were arranged awkwardly. The A/C was terrible and probably the worst issue of all. We literally had towels in the bed to wipe our sweat while trying to sleep. There is also not enough hooks to hang bath towels. Is it asking too much to get s few hooks installed on the back of the restroom doors for towels? Fridge didn't make adequate ice cubes...melted into a solid brick of ice but froze our drinks we purchased. Breakfast at The Pantry was not appetizing and definitely not worth the price because of poor tastes. Several of the waitresses and a few of the dealers on the casino floors were not friendly and/or rude to they point that i was forced to express my displeasure with their treatment of guests. It was not a good experience and I highly doubt I will return. Especially when MGM offers many other nice properties.
50,I always go to Vegas for my Birthday this year I came alone but had a very comfortable stay. I won a jackpot and got a massage from the spa. It was a little slice of heaven. I felt comfortable being by myself with the constant presence of the security staff. Housekeeping was very helpful and nice leaving me extra towels so that they didn't have to clean and enter every day of my seven day stay.
10,They overcharged us so much money! Check in & check out took hours! We got locked out of our room by the hotel and it took almost two hours for them to resolve it. We had to ruddest staff like we bothered them when we had an issue.
40,One thing that definitely made this stay very much worth it was its location on the strip. Was practically in the middle of everything so no need to worry about one thing being too further away from the other. Our room was pretty great however there was a few things left behind from people who previously booked that room that left us a bit worried that the room was not attended to be cleaned properly. All in all it was a very awesome stay.
50,Great hotel in the center of the strip. Beautiful rooms and gorgeous pool. The rooms were a great size and the beds are very comfortable. Great restaurants onsite. I was a little disappointed that none of the ice machines worked especially with temperatures in triple digits.
50,I stayed in this hotel with one of my best friends. The pricing was fantastic. The gambling was fantastic. I really liked going to breakfast at the still downstairs. We had a great view of the pool outside. The staff was amazing. Thank you.
50,The Mirage is in a great location. This was our 2nd stay there. The elevators are right off the casino floor. The elevators are designated to different floors so reaching your floor is quick and easy. Rooms are clean and spacious. Beds are comfortable with 4 nice pillows. Service is okay on the casino floor. Bartender at the bar is kind of rude. Check-in was super easy with mobile app. with option of key card or mobile key on your phone.  Thank you!
50,Great stay and location! We enjoyed the food and fun. The mirage is centrally located and a great environment for all occasions. The front desk was exceptional especially when I told her it was our anniversary
20,No coffee maker in any room. You must go through casino and get an expensive coffee. No microwave in room. Pillows are too high and stiff meaning no matter how you sleep your neck is cricked up in an odd way. difficult to sleep and terrible neck pain when you wake up The AC says 65 but there's no way the room is that chilly. Even overnight it was too warm in the room even putting fan on high.
50,I really enjoyed my stay this weekend at the mirage but my favorite thing about staying here is their Mobil check in / check out ! It’s very convenient and easy to use they also provide a mobile keycard
10,So many incidents to count. My disabled aunt with Parkinson’s had the worst experience. Her nephew Kyle was harassed by security and he is 25 yrs old A nice witness came forward with a video of how he was treated by staff. Horrible!
50,Every time I am in Las Vegas I make the Mirage my first choice. From the pools to the restaurants it has everything I need. And the staff is awesome! A cigar in the Rhumbar at 4 is a standard every day.
30,Good places to eat. Good location. Very friendly staff. Encountered too many problems that should not have occurred. Those were very poor internet connection trash in hallway for almost 3 days room not made up one day and in-room safe not working.
20,I paid $588.00 for 4 nights plus $44 a night resort fee. Not worth the money.    I would not have mind paying more at a much better hotel just to be comfortable.    There was one ice machine for an entire floor and 99% of the time it was in the process of making ice because the customers had taken all of it.
40,Wonderful hotel for the price and location on the strip. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. I only had two issues with our stay: The walls are paper thin. We were woken up on a nightly basis due to loud neighbors in the hallway. I had a problem with the pool as well: it opens at 9AM. We got down there at 9:30 and all seats were taken by either people or towels. I asked the staff what the policy was on removing just towels on a chair. It was quite obvious that people were saving seats as they went out and enjoyed breakfast. The pool manager assured me that they went around every hour and removed towels from chairs if that was the only thing marking a chair. I never saw them do this once. They tried to convince me to either buy $220 a day couples package for the elite pool or $700 on a cabana. Don’t fall for it. My advice is get in line for the pool between 8-8:30 AM so you can play the game to get a seat. The pool was wonderful besides the lack of seats though.
10,There was vomit on the outside of my window from one of the upper floors and obviously they had not been cleaned all year from stains. The curtains are old and dusty USB ports didn’t have power shower curtain was stained.
50,Good restaurants selection of food and atmosphere. . First time staying here. Would recommend . Quick snacks to late night dining available. Hotel in the middle of the strip . Easy to Uber to other properties
50,Upon check out the associate that assisted me refunded the resort fee because I paid for parking (didn't know I could get my ticket validated). All I did was mention that I had paid the day before - not even expecting a refund - this is what customer satisfaction is all about. I work for a company that utilizes JD Powers for surveys. I know the value of good customer service - it truly makes people want to do business with you.  Also it was my first time staying at the Mirage - what a great first impression! I will spread the word!  Thank you!
50,"My family stayed at the Mirage for 8 nights / 9 days over the Memorial Day weekend 2021 with two 72 year old dads. As a preliminary note I have also stayed at the Bellagio Flamingo Vdara Imperial Palace (which is now the Linq) Aria and Park. Of all these hotels the Mirage has honestly been one of my favorite experiences because it was much more affordable but still centrally located on the Strip and presented an analogous benefit to Bellagio. While Bellagio is admittedly higher class this does not always translate to a more relaxing stay. In addition paying more money for a ""classier"" room makes as much sense as renting a luxury car if you plan to primarily walk or rideshare around town. Note: Other hotels appear more expensive i.e. Wynn but I have not stayed there. In my opinion the 4-8 hours that you sleep per night in Las Vegas NV is not worth a premium unless it is a momentous occasion.    As for our Mirage stay your experience could change depending on the check in experience. However our encounter was terrifically positive. The front desk employee had a room available for us upon check in without waiting for or paying more to guarantee early check in. We arrived at 11:30AM Pacific Central (Vegas) time. When we reached our room it was clean smoke free and spacious.    The room walls are thin. Bring earplugs since other guests shout/slam doors. Cheaper hotels attract festive crowds.    The most amazing part of our stay was the interaction with housekeeping. They made a consistent effort to greet us warmly even if English was their second language. As we live in Metro-Detroit we were not accustomed to such ""Southern Hospitality"" from complete strangers. This daily affirmation and warm greeting had an undeniable benefit on our stay because we felt more at home. It also presented opportunities to ask for more towels/soaps and we felt more comfortable doing so.    The pool was tropical as pools should be. The line was already long at 8:30AM for an opening at 9AM. Pool staff did not enforce its seating policy. For example many groups sent one person down to cover 5 pool seats with towels and books so their party could eat a mid morning breakfast. Ergo guests present at the pool did not have seats due to one guest saving 5 seats. When confronted the supervisor offered reserved seating as a solution (an adult only pool called the Oasis Cabanas etc.). This explained why the seating policy is not enforced i.e. increased revenue for the hotel."
50,Hotel was clean and so easy to check in and out. Friendly and helpful staff at hotel and casino. Rooms very spacious and super clean. Easy access to Las Vegas Blvd. Highly recommend this hotel and casino.
10,I was looking forward in staying at mirage since i took my granddaughters which have always like the fire show which they have watched from treasure island in the past but sadly our stay wasn’t pleasant
50,The Mirage is a great MGM Hotel to stay with. From housekeeping to front desk. restaurants host  Slots machines everyone is great beautiful please friendly.clean..  I highly recommend. The Heritage Restaurant it's located inside the Mirage.
10,Booked a two queen room. Asked for rollaway. Was told there was a 40 nt charge. We declined. So we got to room and it was a King. Dishonest check in. Room was average. Not many restaurants available. They did comp rollaway but the Dishonest process was bad.
50,We had a great and relaxing time at this end of the strip near the Fashion Show Mall. Great service food and fun. We especially enjoyed the fantastic food at the Snack. Affordable and better than anticipated. Loved the slots. Love MGM.
40,Everything is trying to be all digital/electronic but I'm old school and like to be waited upon. Service was fine. Food options were ok Not all of them open or had restricted hours. Center of strip location a plus. Multiple elevators for certain floors which was great. Lobby and guest elevators where a long way from each other through the casino.
20,So my wife and I were really looking forward to this trip mostly because of how nice the pool is there and that there was a separate deep soaking tub and shower. We are not big gamblers we just enjoy having some adult time at a nice resort which I thought the Mirage was. I know it is the original mega resort so I know that it is the oldest one on the strip.  Here are the positives: we were put up on the 25th floor which had a great view of the pools as well as the strip itself. By being on the highest non-suite floor it meant that we had access to the elevators which serviced the 24th and 25th floors ONLY. So we didn’t have to wait in line just to get into the elevators (btw Leslie in guest services is extremely helpful in booking rooms. I would ask for her if you are going to go there). Our room was the 6th from the end which meant it was very quiet. The room was nice and clean as well.    Here are the negatives. In the room the “separate tub and shower” was as I expected it would be. For one the shower was very small- a 4x3 stall. The shower head looked (and worked) like there was a sale at Walmart. It was not adjustable it was about 6 1/2 feet up and you could barely move it. When the water came out of the shower head it felt like a sandblaster. Not enjoyable. The shower valve was loose to where I was concerned it would come apart. And there was no way that I could find to make it more “together”. And the shower door never closed completely which meant having a significant pool of water on the floor when stepping out.  The tub was not big at all. I know that having separate tub/showers were new when the Mirage opened in 1989 but I would not call it a “deep soaking tub” unless of course you are a midget (wait can I say midget? I meant little person/dwarf/small child). My wife who is 5’7” couldn’t even fit. If you want a nice deep soaking tub and spacious shower you’ll need to get a suite at the Mirage. Or try Bellagio. Just don’t expect it in any of Mirages Tower rooms.  Also the toilet was very short and the tissue holder is about 2 feet behind where you sit. If you have shoulder issues be aware of this.    As beautiful as the pool is it is so OVERRUN by parents that have brought their children (this includes teenagers) with them. Let me see I can take my kids to Disney Universal the Grand Canyon a water park or the beach. Where should we go...I know let’s go to Vegas and ruin all the vacations of all the adults that were smart enough to know that Las Vegas is NOT for children. Then  I can pay $150 for a meal and listen to a bunch of screaming children that missed their naps because the parents wanted to drag them out to the strip to bake in the 100-degree heat! WTH?!?! So it was very disappointing to have to deal with that when trying to enjoy an adult vacation.  Overall The Mirage will not have me as a guest any time soon maybe ever. Sad because it is such a beautiful place. Or it was.
10,Horrible no employees was told everyone wants to sit on unemployment and the ones that do are doing the job of 4 people.An employee barged into my room claiming that they were doing repairs on a vacant room ...I was moved rooms as a result of a broken tub and left items that were not logged with security reappeared after my fquestioning .I did not feel safe there .no restaurants open mon-weds in the evening . Food at only breakfast place took two hours and was told they added tables but not staff ..it was horrible just horrible
10,Don’t waste your time or money here. Too many things wrong to list. The worst was the room used washcloth left hanging from previous guest. Hair in the bathroom floor and the bathtub. Hair also on the bed. Too long to be my hair. Not sure how much they clean. The bathroom sink gurgles often and the toilet gurgles less frequently. The floor of the room is noticeably slanted. I thought I was just feeling a little dizzy but my husband placed a soda can on the floor and it rolled without hesitation across the floor ugh! There is much more to say but it’s just too much.
50,Nice place to stay. Staff amazing resort is very clean. Food is good and the pool is amazing. Drinks at the pool with water fall by you on 5 days of 105+ degree days! The only thing I disliked was the wait in line to wait for pool to open up.
40,Our trip to Vegas was very enjoyable at The Mirage. From the moment we checked in to the moment we checked out service was outstanding. We do feel that the room especially the bathroom needs updating. It just felt and looked old compared to the rest of the resort.  While there we soaked up the sun and swam in their fabulous pool ate a fantastic brunch poolside enjoyed the casino floor as well as some beverages at their bars. Thanks Mirage!!!
50,i like mirage stay by location everything near my family love it everything in mirage guest staying mirage parking need to be free then you get more guest in there need smoke free out side public place who need smoke need smoking aria .
10,they overbook rooms so don't plan on getting the room type you reserve. Everything closes at 6pm including the pool! Bring your own water unless you like paying $15 per 32 oz bottle! Drinks? Forget it!! Two margarita's at the pool is $70 !!!  Thank you!
20,I visit Vegas every year and try out new hotels I will put this one down as second worse hotel. I had a tower suite first you try to look out the window to see the view and it has the Beatles logo on outside so can’t see pool or the amazing view you thought you would. The room had three bulbs burnt out two TVs didn’t work in the bathroom the ceiling was leaking water. Front desk when calling about the problems was rude and never helped at all. So when I was walking in the casino seen a very dressed guy with a tag and asked if I could talk to a manager because front desk kept saying the manager won’t do anything either. This man did get me a new room floor was dirty when walking in like it did t get vacuumed. Still bad view but by this time I had already wasted 3 hrs dealing with the problems. Did get my resort fees taking off. Another note of you want a chair at the pool be down there at 9am put a towel over the chair and go do what ever you want and come back that is what everyone is doing and nobody monitors it.
40,You get what you pay for. This resort is in a prime location and the theming and volcano show is simply amazing. Not a ton a quick food options (snacks is good) but otherwise I enjoyed my stay. Will be staying here again in the future.
20,Stayed for convention- Dated interiors bathrooms rusty and dirty and bad air filtration. It’s a shame because the staff is awesome and location is great. Wouldn’t recommend this hotel even for the price.
50,The Mirage was one of the best hotels we ever stayed at it we had fun it was friendly clean and everybody that was involved with the Mirage was fantastic I recommend The Mirage hotel casino to everyone and I will pass the word on the great experience that we had with the Mirage Hotel Mirage Hotel we thank you and my family thanks you
40,Room wasn’t ready at check in but said they would put a rush on it and call me when it was ready. Went to front desk 3 hours later to inquire why they haven’t called me yet. They apologized and said the room was ready and someone should of called me. They gave me a 100 dollar dining credit for the inconvenience. I felt that was very good customer service and appreciated the credit
50,Location great rooms nice and clean staff very friendly. Only complaint would be that never was offered a drink while using slot machines over two days—not once! And was not informed no room cleaning unless requested. Thought when we saw the door sign to hang if you did NOT want room cleaned that meant someone would clean room and restock bath.
20,TV in our room was barely watchable. Room hadn’t been vacuumed well. Charged $15 to park for a one day stay is robbery. Most of the restaurants including the buffet were closed. Their website didn’t mention this.
10,No one is very helpful long waits valet eating checkin no competent staff no one is gambling on the floor it’s the new Luxor but cost more hotel has lost its shine always wanted to stay wished I booked elsewhere
50,The hotel was great had a good time staff was friendly and really helpful. This was my 6 time going to Vegas and The mirage is one of the nicest hotel I stayed at. I had the mirage king volcano view and it was great watching the show from the room.
30,Our room was a bit dirty someone’s old soap was left in our shower and the sink/toilet kept making a gargling noise throughout the night. We got terrible sleep. The casino part of the hotel was great and clean.
50,We loved our stay at the Mirage! We got a great deal on a 1 bedroom Tower Suite. The room was spacious and comfortable. We loved the Pools and had a great day hanging out by the pool eating and drinking! The service at the pool was spectacular. But we had good service all over the Hotel and Resort (front desk casino MLife Desk and the Pantry). I can’t wait to go back!
40,I have staid at the Mirage many times. The room price for the location is a great value and the rooms are nice/clean. Mirage is a good basic hotel. The pool area is large and all the staff is friendly and efficient. Sadly a few things have change here. 1. Mirage no longer has a poker room and only one Piagow table. 2. Not a good offering of eateries and the ones they do have are opened limited hours. I basically use the hotel as a staying point and opted to play/eat at other places on the strip.
40,Trip was great. 1st room was not clean things were broken. Got sent to a 2nd room and everything was all good. The smell in the casino is the best. Other than being understaffed it was amazing for Memorial Day weekend.
50,The staff was very friendly great location. And the pool was amazing. Only thing was the on line check in process was a bit confusing to the technology challenged but we got thru it. Wish there was more people to help hit we get it n
10,Check in was terrible. Took forever and they didn't have our room. No room service available. Very few restaurants open. Minimum staff. Very outdated hotel with no modern amenities. Why even bother opening for guests without advertised amenities.
20,The room would not get cooler than 73 degrees and there was no coffee maker or microwave in the room. The pool table was nice. I called the front desk regarding the broken phone and they advised they would send someone to fix it and no one ever came or contacted me again.
50,I stayed at the Mirage 5/27-5/31 and had a great time! My room was clean with no complaints. Cocktail service while playing tables was quick and consistent. I didn't drink other nights while playing slots but the cocktail waitresses were coming around consistently as well. Spent my last day at the pool and it was amazing! Our server was really nice and came around often considering how busy it was. I actually saw her running a couple times trying to keep up. Loved her effort! I recommend and will be staying here again!
50,Location of the mirage was exceptional. Very close to center of the strip. The check in and check out process was very smooth and the workers were great. Our room was on the 25th floor and had a view of the volcano and strip. Overall very pleased with our stay!
30,I checked in pretty late & was extremely tired so I didn’t bother to complain but in the future I will look for another hotel choice for what I paid that shouldn’t have been something I had to experience
30,Checked in during the last week of May 2021. We immediately noticed the shower was very dirty and seemed like it hadn’t been thoroughly cleaned in a while. Other than that a great staff and location. I will think twice about booking a room here again.
40,Our family of five enjoying staying at the Mirage. It’s a beautiful hotel with a wonderful pool and in a great location to enjoy the Las Vegas strip. Our only complaints were no Coffee pots in the room and no usable fridge… Only a mini bar. Like every hotel on the strip it is very smoky. However it is a great hotel and we would stay there again.
40,We had a fun stay at the mirage. Room was clean with a great view of the strip. Room does not have a fridge microwave or a coffee maker. Not a shocker since its vegas but it would be nice to have. Great pillows!!
50,Our first time staying at The Mirage. We enjoyed the grounds and the cleanliness of the hotel. It was a nice little getaway for the weekend. We ordered room service from Pantry. Delicious! Definitely would stay here again.
50,We absolutely loved staying here it’s clean staff is friendly pool area is always welcoming. All restaurants in casino resort are open. This casino is in Las Vegas walking strip. It’s relaxing to stay here. Parking is easy to station in
50,Very clean high end hotel in the middle of the strip . Our room was immaculate the staff was very friendly and went out of there way to make sure everything was top notch . Gorgeous pool Definitely will go back
40,Service at the pool was awful and even though we paid for pool chairs we were ignored for over an hour. Locked out of room becuz they didn't merge our reservations. Second time this has happened back to back.
50,We stayed at the Mirage for my daughter's dance competition which was held at the Mirage convention center. 99% of the staff was amazing the rooms were large and the location was perfect. There was a wide selection of food and beverages to choose from within the hotel. The salon gave great pedicures. My only complaint would be that the hotel room bathrooms could use some updating and there were a few staff members that were unnecessarily rude. Overall it was a wonderful stay and we will definitely return.
40,Just stayed here 3 nights in a King Junior Suite on 24th floor. The best part of this was not having to stop on 23 floors going down or up! Special elevator for the suites. The room was beautiful with a few issues though. The TV sound bar was gone. The make up chair was gone. The refrigerator is actually a freezer. The ice was all frozen together and our sodas burst in the freezer. The couch had a cigarette burn with a tissue shoved into it. There were some parties one night on our floor but in the room it was quite. I’d love to stay here again once they update their suites.
40,The Mirage is centrally located and provides easy access to Shopping Dinning and Entertainment. It's a short walk to the Linq which is lined with Restaurants  Zip Lining  Music and of course just People watching!
30,This was a okay visit. I miss the buffet. The tables had nice prices. The dealers don't acknowledge you when you sit down or when you give them a tips. They acted more like robots than dealers. It took some of the fun out of playing.
50,We stayed back in Nov. 2020. Enjoyed our stay and overall experience. Great price too! Clean rooms great location to everything kind staff clean gym great pool plenty of food and beverages places
30,Room was dirty when we arrived looked like they never dusted any thing and looked like someone was doing coke in bathroom and towels were dirty. They did take off resort fee I felt they should have given more off
50,The Mirage is our favorite place to stay in Vegas. The staff is friendly and kind food is great and it's a very clean place. Very close to others that you can walk and enjoy the outside. Easy access in the Mirage as well.
50,Fun in the sun! Great pool side service. The cabana was a first for us so much fun and a nice place to relax out of the sun. I will definitely come back for another stay in the future. The adult pool was nice as well!
40,Super busy but overall clean and friendly. Disappointed in lack of shows they all begin in June. Make restaurant reservations days ahead of time not day-of. Pool was nice but crowded. $27 taxi to/from airport. It's 1.2 miles from Mirage to MM store... We walked down $15 taxi back.
20,This was our first trip to Vegas and what a wonderful city. Unfortunately I didn't have the same feeling about the Mirage. After Checking in and stuff being broken in our room we had to change rooms 2 times before we were in a room that was functioning at least. The cocktail servers on the casino floor were very rude and at first I thought this was just how people were in Las Vegas and then we went across the street and had a wonderful experience. Its not hard keep stuff maintained and hire enough staff to cover your floor and ask them not to be rude to guests.
50,Beautiful! Clean! Friendly staff excellent location!! I frequent Las Vegas and this property is an A! I know there is lots of new stuff but you can’t beat Mirage location and customer service. I was super pleased with my stay.
40,The Mirage is in a good location for all the places we like to visit. The rooms are kinda of small but we don’t stay in the room very much anyway. They have a few good restaurants. The best part about this hotel is the pool. It has a rock waterfall and the main pool is 3 1/2 ft. Overall great place to stay in Las Vegas.
50,Our first stay at the Mirage after many many years at other MGM properties was an overall pleasant one!  The first impression was that it was clean tropical well kept and didn’t have an odor to it! The casino and common areas were very clean and busy given it was Memorial Day weekend.  The restaurant options were very nice and none seemed out of line in terms of price. Food options were varied and generally good!  The pool was absolutely fantastic! The vibe was generally laid back but fun enough with a balm of kids and adults. It is very large and open with many options as to where to lay out. Drink service was excellent and the wait staff was punctual and pleasant.  Our room was fairly standard and clean with the proper amenities.  My only complaint was that the bathroom was an odd set up entirely too small and cramped. The foyer area of the room could be cut in half and add it to a larger bathroom area and it would be just fine!    Overall it was a good value for the money. The location on the strip and access to the strip is excellent!
10,Upon arrival the front desk was amazing. However we get to our room the linen was not clean and the showerhead was malfunctioning. The room I rented for my daughter also had a malfunctioning showerhead. And my brother suite there were dirty towels in the closet and food crumbs all over the counters. The rooms were completely outdated with wallpaper tearing off of the wall and chips out of the countertops. We went to the still around 10 PM and we refused drinks because they said their kitchen was backed up. I don’t know how that has anything to do with the bartender but apparently it did. Room service ended really early even though they advertise is 24 hours. The fitness center is a one star facility. While gambling at the slot machines you may get one drink every 4 to 5 hours. It’s a shame that once a nice hotel has now become some thing similar to Motel 6.
20,I stayed at the Mirage 5/28 & 5/29- Each night I was greeted by late night fighting in the hotel hallway and was unable to reach the front desk each night.  In addition to that drink services while on the gaming floor was slow- often times it would take up to 45 minutes for a simple drink.
20,Staff entered my room once without knocking. I understand rooms need to be cleaned but i felt very uncomfortable with the room as though I had to leave right away because I was holding people up from doing their job.
50,We have had to cancel three trips because of covid. So happy to be back at the Mirage. It's the hotel that keeps me going back to Vegas not Vegas itself. Love the pool and rarely leave the hotel. Great restaurants too!
40,Spent 5 nights at Mirage. Location is great and the pool area is awesome. Love the dolphin bar at the pool. Good table minimums and options for food. Just wish they had a couple lower cost restaurants and Pai Gow Poker
30,Our room was right next to the elevator machine room. Although the staff was all very nice our room was in a terrible location. I would suggest to make this room into a storage room because the noises are loud and I didn’t get any sleep or rest. I would ask for a different room if you end up having a room near the elevators.
50,Mirage is a beautiful property with an amazing pool and lots to do and see. It’s my home base when ever I stay on the strip due to the central location amazing theme and great service. I also love how the windows pop open a little in the basic rooms.
40,Birthday weekend in Vegas stayed at the mirage we are coming back in soonMgm app is great didn’t have to wait at any lines checked in through app and walked straight to the room . Room key is on MGM APP.
30,Overall stay was good. Food service was lacking - not enough help for the number of people there. We averaged an hour wait for each meal - way longer than expected and it interfered with our other plans. This was snack type meals not sit down restaurants. We waited an hour and a half for one lunch when the restaurant ran into ordering issues with all to-go orders. Overall the Mirage is nice with a good pool. Saw the dolphin show which was good. Just felt like there was more people staying at the hotel than they could support. More rooms than they could serve.
30,We booked two volcano view rooms both are not on the same floor as well as too much dryness that created bleeding nose issues. We don’t want to recommend this place to anyone. This is not what I expected from mirage hotel.
50,This hotel was excellent. From the front desk to the housekeeping to the employees on the casino floor. The food was also awesome. The pools are nice as well. I would definitely recommend this location.
50,Nice low key atmosphere. Clean.. safe.. pool was awesome they serve margaritas Pina Coladas and Miami Vices on tap with or without alcohol. The front desk. Bell hops pool staff security dealers cafe workers room service and cleaning staff all did an amazing job making us feel welcomed and comfortable. The location is truly right in the middle of the action but off the strip enough to not get walk through riff-raff. Tip: when the restaurants are all over run on the strip order room service.. it’s affordable and way faster.
40,The Mirage is a centrally located hotel on the strip that supports a wide range of clientele. Mixed among the young old and in between were families with young children scattered throughout the property. The service and food were above average and the beds were quite comfortable. The poker room is now gone taken up by a non-smoking section. If location and diverse crowds are your cup of tea then the Mirage is the real deal…..
50,Absolutely fantastic will definitely be back. Room was great food was good service was exceptional etc…. Like all things Vegas if you plan in staying at The Mirage prepare for a good time. Oh and the pool was fantastic!
50,The Mirage was cleaner and much more respectable than the more expensive Casinos. Best bang for the buck without the loss of class. Their tables are great. Friendly staff all through the place. Dealers don’t make you feel bad while sitting at the table. Good vibes. Tip your dealers by the way.
30,Just ridiculous the prices & minimal comps compared to other resorts. Paid quite a bit to stay & play but they wouldn't give us anything really. Room service acted like we were an inconvenience & house keeping wouldn't respond. Had to call the front desk to get a response.
20,Property looks good but need to step up the customer service. From waiting for drink service (never showed up) to poor dress staff needs to recognize when customers are present. Many restaurants/lounges were closed but hopefully this is just due to reopening following covid.
20,I have wanted to stay here for years and finally decided to give it a try. Man was I disappointed. First let me say the room was nice. However the walls are paper thin. There was a fight (verbal fight) in the hallway at about 3am near our door and we could hear everything. We could hear the rooms on both sides of us as well. We tried calling the front desk multiple times about the incident as it lasted about 15 but there was no answer. The pool is nice but was severely over crowded. There were no chairs anywhere to be found. Many people just laid on the ground wherever they could find room. The smell of weed was everywhere and the casino floor was much smaller with little variety of games. Drink service was for the most part nonexistent we would have to go to the bar and pay $15 for a drink while gambling because there were no waitresses to be found. We will not be returning to this casino resort
50,Great service. The check in and check out process was fast and easy. Our rooms was very clean and the staff were all friendly. The pool was gorgeous and overall the entire property. Very clean property
50,Our original plans were cancelled for the weekend so it was a last minute decision to take my elderly father uncle and aunt to vegas and the hotel accommodated my request to have rooms next to each other all last minute. We all had a great time in the 30 hours we stayed there. I didn’t lose any of the elders at any time and they were thankful I brought them to vegas with me and my children.
40,Clean rooms clean property. The beds were comfortable. I wish housekeeping didn’t knock on the door at 9am I always sleep in on vacation.  The pool area was very nice but the food and drinks way overpriced. I went across the street to a Walgreens and bought some drinks and brought them into the pool area bad they were fine with that. Even Bri g a holiday weekend we still found a pool lounger and they have recently been allowed to increase capacity so we didn’t need to worry about not being allowed into the pool.
50,The Mirage did well in comping me my room rate and some room charges during my stay. I have been coming here for many years and this was they best comped trip I have ever had. Yeah I play the $25 Blackjack tables but usually I don't get many comps. This trip they surprised me.
20,My room wasn’t completely cleaned. Found stains outside the mini fridge and a bag in the restroom. Hotel guest were too loud and didn’t get a good night sleep (but expected that part in Vegas for MD weekend. Surprised to say that I had a better experience at the Circus Circus Hotel the night prior (first timer).
30,First of all I would like to say every worker I encountered at The Mirage was very friendly and very helpful and the swimming pool was amazing! With that being said I was disappointed in the outdated room and the uncleanliness of it. My sister has never been to Las Vegas so I wanted to stay somewhere nice. I was shocked when we got into the room. The carpet was stained and dirty the bathroom had long black hair in it and had dust bunnies all over underneath the counter and the floor by the beds looked like it hadn't even been vacuumed.    I'm not a picky person and have never written a bad review but feel I needed to write this one about the room. Unless The Mirage would have a complete renovation and update of their rooms I would not stay here again.
50,This was the first trip that my husband and I took together and we absolutely enjoyed every day of our vacation from the dolphin show to the fine dining. We are already making plans to return in December for his birthday we both was excited to be in the middle of everything!!!
10,The maids entered our room an hour before check out while we were having breakfast downstairs despite the privacy sign being on the door handle. They threw away all of my makeup and shower supplies. The rooms were filthy stains everywhere moldy bath tubs… make sure you wear shoes in the showers.
50,Very friendly staff made the check in process very easy and quick. Had a great view of the volcano which was fun! It has a great location walking distance to the Belagio water fountains which is a must see show if it’s your first time in Vegas
50,From the start of our stay until the moment we left the staff was superb. Most properties in LV are fanatic. The Mirage stands out for the customer service IMO.  LV is getting to be a much more expensive visit than it used to be so when I Mark average for the value in this review it’s regarding the room and the food. I am certain it will the the same everywhere in LV.
50,The rooms are very nice spacious and clean. The hotel and casino are clean and welcoming. My daughter and I had a great time for her first trip to Las Vegas. This is a good location right on the strip.
40,We spent four days at the resort and would highly recommend for clean rooms and great food. Casino machines were pretty friendly. Although not completely open due to the virus the amenities that were open were well staffed and worth the price.
20,Room was really dilapidated. Chips in bath tub and carpet fringed. There was an elevator that had a stain on an elevator that appeared to be vomit that wasn’t cleaned the entire time we were there. The elevators also had buttons that were not working.
20,We've been going to this hotel for years and we're excited to stay here after not having gone for a year due to pandemic. The usual room we stayed at is now more dated than I remember a year ago. I used my Mlife card and was happy to be able to get a cheaper room but they put you in an ugly room with view of a roof. It was frustrating to eat out because most restaurants are booked. The slots are way too tight. They didn't even give you a little enjoyment playing. I just felt their slots were just collecting. We hardly saw servers serve drinks at the casino floor. I hope they renovate and improve their service and amenities soon now that Vegas is reopening. We moved to Venetian and wow.. what a big difference. That's the only time we really enjoyed our time.
10,The room next to ours caught on fire and we were woken up before 9AM each day by the hammering and noise of the crew fixing it. Our room was dirty like half an inch of dust on the vents and sills dirty wads of hair in the tub dirty broken bed and mold on the fridge dirty. Most of the staff was not friendly so we didn’t hang around the property very much. Good location is about all I can say that’s positive. This was our second stay at the Mirage and our last.
20,Line to check in was long and slow moving. We booked a double queen room but were given a king room but was told it had a pool view but it had a roof top view. My credit card was charged several hundred dollar deposit so my credit card was put on a fraud hold. I needed to waste valuable vacation time to reactivate my card. If I would have known in advance I could have notified my credit card. The rooms are very out dated but clean. We were given free play but it does not work in most of the machines and it takes a long time to figure out which one. We won $5 on $75 free play. We did not get many wins at all so we went to several of the surrounding casinos where we lost several hundred dollars but were able to play for several days. We were given comp dollars with our reservation but did not end up using all of them. We will be staying elsewhere in August and October. Suggestions?
40,I have stayed here twice. The rooms are okay the location on the Strip is excellent. I did have a problem with a room chair that was extremely worn and stained as if someone had urinated while sitting in it. It needs to be replaced. In-hotel restaurants are EXTREMELY expensive.
30,Decent stay very crowded at times. Room was nice just dated. Always waiting for drinks on gaming floor. Wonderful people working here. Dolphin show was great. The pantry was a great place to eat but the line took hours. Need to open buffet again
50,This is a review about my experience with Yoli. Such a genuinely sweet woman. Came here for my bachelor party and she made the night. Mirage was also very clean and had a great atmosphere. Thank you Yoli for making the experience fantastic.
50,I went to visit the Mirage with friends for a bachelor party. Yolly was the main woman we bet with when playing blackjack she was the sweetest dealer ever and made the experience so much better. The hotel was great and comfortable. Thank you Yolly!
50,I stay at the Mirage about four times a year. Love the location and size of the hotel. It’s just the right size of a hotel. A lot of the hotels in Las Vegas are to big. You can walk outside and be at several hotels in 10 minutes. The rooms are clean and the hotel is still a classic.
30,My stay here was okay. I did not receive any room services as far as cleanliness. The only time someone came into my room for fresh towel or to clean was when i had the privacy hanger on the door and was getting dressed etc. They disabled my keys 2 hours prior to my checkout time and the line at the front desk was so long it put me behind on getting to the airport. Location was great and the casino was amazing but as far as staying there again i will not.
50,Hotel was very nice. Pool was amazing. Room was surprisingly large the bathroom wasn't but not an issue for us. The vegan tacos at the pool were incredible!! No prices on minibar was annoying. Would recommend this hotel!
40,"Bathroom was small by recent standards and had only one sink. The ""24 hour"" cafeteria did not open until 10AM..probably could not get enough staff. But did not notice a diminution of service at the front desk at bars or in room service."
40,After 14 months of going nowhere or doing nothing we decided to book a trip to Las Vegas once we were fully vaccinated to celebrate our 39th wedding anniversary. The suite we stayed in at the Mirage was out of this world! Loved everything about it. We read an earlier review on Tripadvisor that there were no coffee makers in the rooms and the line at Starbucks was LONG! I packed my Nespresso machine and had delicious coffee in our suite every morning. Would HIGHLY recommend bring a coffee maker.
50,Very clean hotel I absolutely loved the contact-less check in and check out. I think it is super convenient and especially during times like these. Overall great they have hand sanitizer stations along with mask throughout the casino. Felt safe and at ease.
50,First time my HusbandDaughters and I went to Las Vegas. I wanted to make sure all off us have the best location and the clean environment especially for my youngest since she has allergies and sometimes a Smokie casino area can be harsh on her.we where very happy.all off us
10,The strip view room I paid for was absolutely a joke. My room overlooked the pool and every other couples room I was with overlooked the strip & they paid for regular room. The front desk takes long & was not accommodating! They even began to question me & did not want to adjust the price at all!!!!!!
50,Absolutely stunning! The place was clean and the staff was very professional. The view is right on the strip and in reach literally from everything. There's so much to do since everything is opening back up. Will be back!
20,Our check out wasn’t till 11am and house keeping was already trying to get in at 8am and at 10am. Our room  Smelled like wet carpet and mold our ac would change temps by it’s self.. i don’t know if I would stay here again and I love going to mgm casinos
40,The Mirage Resort is located on the Strip near many of the Casino's that are a must to see. If gambling is what you want it's everywhere you go. People watching is always a great time and you'll see many different types on the Strip. A must see is also Fremont Streel a short bus ride down the street. The night life on Fremont is second to none whatever you're looking for you'll fine it here. The best time to visit Fremont is late afternoon into the evening hours Gambling street vendors music food this is the Place. We spent 3 day's in Vegas and rented a car at the  Airport to do some sight seeing. Hoover Dam Lake Mead. drove Route 66 Grand Canyon before stopping in Flagstaff. The next day we headed towards Phoenix by the way of Sedona. The drive from Flagstaff to Sedona is breath taking winding down through the mountains and canyons until you arrive in Sedona. Flee markets and shops will be of interest too all plus the back drops of the mountains will be fantastic. After a few hours we left for our final destination Phoenix. The following day after returning the car ti the airport we caught our flight back to MSP.
40,Staff was very friendly and helpful 90% of the time. The location is great on the strip. Room was very nice. Tables were usually full and or too expensive for us. The ticket redemption machines did not have any change.
50,This is a fun and busy(!) hotel in the perfect location.  The rooms were beautiful immaculate and extremely comfortable.  The staff is incredible. Every single person from Housekeeping through restaurants retail pool front desk concierge and other services was working so hard to serve the immense crowds. Each one was welcoming friendly and helpful.  The Las Vegas Strip is hectic but The Mirage is an oasis.
50,Staff was awesome. Rooms were good. But could have been cleaned better. the floors were not cleaned or the windows. The bathroom towels had res stains on them. thank goodness I bring my own. Other than that everything else was great
50,Everything was perfect! Check-in through the mobile app was very smooth. Rooms were nice clean and very quiet. Awesome pool and pool side bar and restaurant. Housekeeping made sure our room was clean the entire stay. The hotel didn’t have a cigarette odor like other hotels and casinos have.
40,Good experience overall. The hotel’s no-contact check-in and digital key to the elevator and room is impressive.    The website and app are both very user friendly - which made the booking and check-in process quick and easy.
40,Room and service was very good overall steakhouse was great bell desk was great housekeeping was great check in could of been faster for people that would rather check in person then mobile check in. Information at front desk about bell desk could of been more but would recommend to others. It was a very nice week.
50,Trip was for pleasure with friends. Enjoyed the wonderful cabana at the pool. Food was excellent. Made reservations for breakfast and dinner and was able to get seated quickly. Masks were not required and it made it much more pleasant. The weather varied by 20 degrees but we were able to make the best of it. Had a wonderful time and would most definitely return again.
10,Stuck us in a room 3 miles away it felt  ugly rooms the shower even was broke  couple next to us was fighting all night long . I seriously wanted to leave the second we got to the room but my best friends had a horrible bday so we all tried to stick it out.
50,It was a wonderful resort perfect for walking distance for at least half of the strip! Very clean not nearly as crowded but just as nice... Has a StarbucksVegas shop a decently priced boutique a ice cream shopspa & more. I will defiantly book again...
50,We treated ourselves to a penthouse suite definitely worth the extra few bucks. The room was huge and comfy with a living room dinning room bar huge bathroom with shower and jetted tub. We had a view of the strip and the pool. The entire hotel was very clean and we received excellent service. The pool is really nice and so were the cocktail waitresses and bar staff. Pretty good mid location on the strip. Thanks again Mirage.
10,None of the plugs work in the room the shower was dirty and looked very old ! Nothing like the pictures online. It’s so outdated.  And the location is horrible no phone service no way to get an Uber unless you want to wait 1+ hours.
30,Fruit flies coming from our bathroom drain and most surfaces not actually sanitized such as the SNACKS tables. Staff did not follow up twice and obviously just waited for us to leave before addressing issues. Even without covid it's odd to have tables that say sanitized but actually are dirty with other people's food. To not have the housekeeping dept or Manager follow up regarding the flies in the bathroom was gross. I'll be back when someone decides we deserve an explanation for ignoring these issues.
40,We booked our rooms three of them months in advance and asked that we all be on the same floor and close if possible. We had 211 floor far apart and we had another one on another floor that made it difficult to get to because you have to use the key card for the room to get off on that floor in the elevator. But other than that nice casino nice hotel staff are great.
30,It was nice pool was nice too. It smells like coconuts I did like that. You need to get to the pool early or you can’t find a seat. We did like the food at the cafe in there. We played the slots but no tables.
50,Mirage isn’t the newest but is one of the nicest. Classic tropical theme. The air smells amazing. Room was super clean and comfortable. Great location. Amenities are abundant. Staff friendly and efficient. Casino is right sized.    I’ve stayed at 7 casinos on the strip and Mirage is my favorite!
10,When we arrived to check-in we were informed that our room was oversold and that they were downgrading us to a different room. To make up for this we were promised that a night's stay would be deducted from our bill (which I had already pre-payed when I reserved the room). I just checked my account and saw that the night's stay was never refunded. In addition our $300 bank hold was deducted from our account and then some. When I called to inquire about the one night's stay refund and the bank hold I was told that all they could do was remove the $39 resort fee (way less than the value of the original room I payed for) and remove a charge for a USB kit we didn't use. The man I spoke to one the phone was very dismissive of me and acted like he didn't want to look into the issue. I will never stay at the Mirage or any other MGM hotel again. Its very disappointing to have such a bad experience when you haven't been on vacation in 3 years.
30,Came here on a trip with my girlfriend. We waited in line at the check in and realized mobile check in was faster. Nice to have the option but for those that aren't great at technology it might be complicated. They might want to add more front desk attendants. The room was nice. The bed was really comfy. Unfortunately no fridge that we could store stuff in- I am sure this was purposeful. Bathroom felt a little small compared to other hotels in Vegas. Spent some time at the pool. It was packed but we managed to find chairs (must've been the right time). I do wish the pool was open later. The service at the pool was wonderful and they were attentive to our needs. Once we hit the casino the service was much different. Neither of us were offered a single drink after spending multiple hours on the floor actively gambling. Complementary parking was definitely a plus. Overall it was an average experience but could've been improved by better staffing levels and small tweeks.
30,The Mirage has a good value stay but could be better. The ceiling tiles in the hallway (at least on the 25th floor) need to all be replaced. The A/C in the room could have been better and room constantly smells like smoke even though its a non smoking room. The casino and restaurant options are great the location is perfect overall is a good value stay.
20,Decided to stay here for the weekend because of the location and rate. The location is great because it’s in walking distance of everything. The pool area is nice but wasn’t open when I was there. The room needs work the air conditioning never got the room cooler than 72 degrees and the shower head was too strong and wasn’t adjustable. Overall stay was decent nothing great or horrible.
50,This trip had the usual outstanding experience at the Mirage. Every time I visit Las Vegas we stay at the Mirage as we have never been disappointed. Every staff member is exceptional and helpful. We will be back.
50,Love this property. Gorgeous interior and well kept. Guest rooms could use a bit of love/updating but otherwise very nice size and comfy. Staff was great. Very personable and courteous. Loved the restaurant selections and bars and lounges were nice to enjoy. Casino is laid out well. Highly recommend this property for a vacation destination.
50,I thought the location of the hotel was perfect for a Las Vegas vacation. All of the staff I interacted with were friendly. The room was very comfortable. The restaurants and bars offered at the hotel were great. I loved the pool area. The layout of the hotel is very inviting and upscale. It is not the biggest place on the strip but it is a great place to come back to after a long day and night on the strip. I would love to stay at the Mirage again during my next Las Vegas vacation.    My check-in was pleasant enough but the line was very very long. I had just traveled all day to get to Vegas and the last thing I wanted was to stand in a line like this one. The check-in line was over thirty minutes of standing and waiting. I could not check-in on my phone or at a kiosk because I had a MyVegas reward for a two night stay to combine with my purchased two night stay. I also still do not believe my request was met because after two days I still had a cleaning crew unlock my door while I was napping regardless that I had a do not disturb sign hanging on my handle. This indicated to me that the two-night concurrent reservations were still not left clearly after I waited all that time to make sure that would not happen. My check-in experience was annoying but it was not a deal breaker. I still loved the hotel and my stay at the Mirage.
50,Cleans room good location nice people restaurants were very good parking was fast easy to get to without problems check in was great checking out was no problem and I won on the slots Saturday night best hotel
50,Mirage will always be my first choice when visiting Vegas. Amazing quality beautiful venue friendly/helpful staff members great restaurants (we love Pantry and Diablo's Cantina inside the building) and overall great experience everytime I go.
30,Small rooms. Refrigerator not included and a daily fee is 35 dollars daily. Also you might get charged for mini bar items even if you did not consume. Ask for printed bill at check out. The bathrooms are super tiny the bathtub is dirty and towels smell weird. Need outlets good luck.
10,Room Wasn’t clean takes forever to get something that was requested from customer service Restaurant is very small And smelly. Took six hours to get extra bed towels very old abused. Customer service at the front and On the phone has very bad attitude
40,The location is great because I can get in and out using Spring Mtn road. I’m not stuck on the strip. That’s huge for me. The bathroom is really small though. The staff was very accommodating and friendly and that’s another reason I like to stay at Mirage.
30,Good for basic stay at reasonable price point. Dated and not as nice as I remembered in years past. Room was noisy could hear everything in hallway. Windows very dirty so ruined view. Excellent customer service from front desk to housekeeping.
50,Very clean and friendly staff check in was great and beds were perfect. Would stay again! Only con was no buffet but not the mirage fault it’s still Covid-19. Casino was very clean and had lot of space to get around.
50,Had a wonderful time and the pool service was excellent. Chicken ranch wrap was amazing poolside. All the restaurants were also pretty good. My room was well above par standards. I will recommend the mirage to friends and family in the future!
40,Mirage was our first real Covid vacation. The casino and hotel were clean staff was very accommodating and kind. We felt safe in the hotel and we appreciated the safety measures the hotel had in place. My husband and I will definitely return to the Mirage. The pool and the location are stellar!
40,It was what we expected very nice room and convenient location. We were able to enjoy the strip and many amenities at tge resort as well. I really enjoyed the pool and my wife loved the dolphins and tigers.
30,Car broken into in parking garage. I know it happens but never saw a single security in the garage during our 3 day stay. Impossible to apply express comps. They put you through so many hurdles to use them and will not give you a list of where/what/how to apply them. Roulette tables have that stupid additional space above the 0/00 making the odds even worse.
50,We are repeat customers to the Mirage and this is why- the staff is friendly the location is great and the restaurants are very good. Thanks to covid we did not have buffets or 24 hour room service this time however we did have less crowds. The monorails were shut down but a taxi ride from one end of strip to another was $10( traffic was super light) I think the trade off was worth it. Please come to Vegas and Please stay here!
40,Had a minor issue with our first room and every staff member was accomodating. Love the location. Pillows were awkward and uncomfortable. Both of us had stiff necks every morning. Beds are good. Would be open to staying again.
30,First time at the Mirage. Probably won't go back. Carpet in room was dirty. Bottle cap left under night stand all 4 nights. Didn't care for the gaming selection. I like to play video poker and they didn't have the best selection. All in all it was just ok.
50,Excellent service beautiful atmosphere and great views!!! Would definitely do this trip again for the price! The Oyster bar and grill was Devine! There were so many people and things to do; complete joy from everyone.
30,We had 2 rooms. One had a dirty toilet and broken safe. The other had no hair dryer and the frig wouldn't open. We made it work between the 2 but when asked at checkout they did nothing and didn't even note our disappointment.
40,Mirage is in a great location staff is helpful and friendly. Rooms and casino was clean. A few hick ups at check in. Hopefully it was a one time thing and an oversight by the staff. Overall it was ok... I would try Mirage one more time in the future.
50,We always stay at the Mirage. The pool is AMAZING! Great location friendly staff and clean ! The Mirage has everything you need! We will only stay at this hotel because there is no better one to stay at for price and location and the Beauty of the Hotel.
40,Beautiful resort in the middle of everything! Perfect location and loved the experience and the food was good. We had a wonderful time during our stay and i can’t wait to return . Walking distance to alot
40,Stayed at the Mirage to celebrate our 37th anniversary. All of Vegas was just starting to get back on their feet! Had a wonderful trip hotel room was clean a little dated but acceptable. Staff very attentive pool area clean and beautiful. A little short staffed with casino beverage servers but again Vegas is just getting restarted. We have always stayed at Caesar's properties but have really enjoyed our stay at a MGM property.
50,The Mirage is like home to us when we come to Las Vegas. We usually come two times a year and love staying at the Mirage. One thing we did miss this trip (and last September) was that the Pantry is not open 24/7 like it used to be...we hope it soon returns to normal as it seems that things are really “all open” now and more people are coming to Las Vegas and The Mirage! Also hoping the the Beatles Love Show will be open soon also!
30,Our room was dirty. There was hair everywhere and spots in the sheets. Room was ready late and the ice machine was broken on our floor all week. Front desk seemed annoyed with anything we asked for help with.
20,The shower in our first TWO rooms would not drain. We were finally moved to a third room before we had a fully functioning shower. We had to move twice and had dinner plans so it was quite the hassle to move so much luggage twice during a 3 night stay. Will not recommend to anyone unless this hotel improves on BASIC accommodations such as a fully draining shower.
50,I love staying here I can't wait to book my next trip and for all the restaurants to be open. I also love how central it is to everything mobile check in and out is a must! Very easy to use and great way to skip all the line.
40,The check in process was extremely slow and when we were finally able to have assistance the clerk was slow couldn't find our room we reserved 2 king rooms with strip/volcanoe view. Nothing available only 2 queens. Even though we reserved king room. Waited in line for 45 minutes. The rooms were good once we got to them just not what we reserved. What's the point of reservations if you don't get what you reserve?
50,Great hotel! Check in took forever but the staff was so nice and the room was amazing however our tv did not work. That was okay beaches we weren’t in our room only at night. Will definitely be coming back again.
20,Dirty room if you look behind the backboard of the bed it looks like that area has NEVER been cleaned. We were in our room with the privacy sign on the outside and the cleaning lady knocked then just proceeded to open the door without permission. I was taking a bath and the tub kept losing water. The ice bin stopped working so there was no ice for the whole 18th floor for most of our stay. Bring your own water and dont expect to get a fridge in the room unless you pay $40 extra PER NIGHT. Our room was also attached to another room with people we didnt know and had absolutely no view of the strip. Yeah it wasnt great. Come here if you want a crappy room.
40,A quick little get away to visit family and friends from different parts of the US (Alaska California and Tennessee). We did mobile check in and it was a breeze. One of the highlights was the Rhumbar. I recommend this spot to anyone who want to relax.
50,If you’re looking for a great value for your money I’d definitely recommend the Mirage. The mobile app check-in was so easy! We checked in on the app right when our plane landed got to the hotel checked our bags at the bell desk which was also super easy then got a notification on my phone once our room was ready. The room was ready by 2 PM and we went straight up without having to stop at the desk because the app also can be used as your room key. The room key app worked great during the weekdays we stayed but you could tell the system got a little overwhelmed once the weekend hit...luckily printing actual key cards was fast and easy too. The room was beautiful we stayed in a resort king and the bathroom with the separate tub was perfect. We didn’t have a microwave or fridge in the room but that’s typical Vegas. The pool was amazing. We ordered room service from the pantry and it was delicious. You can join mobile wait lists for the in-house restaurants so I definitely recommend that since waits can get long with so many people out traveling again. The online wait list allows us to stay in our room and get ready then the hostess text me once our table was ready and we went down and we’re sat immediately. Mobile checkout was also a breeze. Everyone we encountered was extremely nice! Definitely recommend for a more laid back stay right on the strip.
40,Room was nice and big. Some outlets were a little scarey and needs fixed plugs would just fall out. Beds comfy and AC worked great. My main complaint was if you wanted a chair at the pool you had to show up and get in line by 7 or 8 am for first come first serve chairs and pool doesn't open til 9am. Only options were a cabana for $600+ or rent 6 chairs in VIP section for $330 not sure if it was always like this or if it's just because of Vegas recently opening up everything. I found it disappointing that we couldn't get a spot at the pool but otherwise a great trip and would stay at Mirage again hoping the pool situation is better
40,Stay at Mirage was great!! Friendly staff and even though this is an older property it is kept up well. Awesome pool but the slots are tight there lol. One issue we had was the ac in the room was less than sufficient and the ice machine on our floor was broken. The hotel comped 2 days of resort fees to make up for it. Would definitely stay there again.
30,Billed as relaxing. Not really any different. Yes there was a air purifier and an aroma machine as well as a chlorine filer in the shower but other than that it is THE SAME AS EVERY OTHER THIN WALLED NOT WELL KEPT ROOM. The bathroom fan didn’t work a sink drip was disturbing and the party in the hall every night and next room until 3 am we’re anything but relaxing. It is a gimmick. The separate entrance isn’t really exclusive.
50,They are extremely customer oriented. They were great!! When I had a small issue that was my own fault for not understanding something. The staff fixed it without me even asking!! The were very friendly and attentive.
40,Enjoyed hanging out at the pool rooms were comfortable but due to the construction of the hotel room doors allowed hallway noise all night. If you are military book your room under the service members name so you can get the rewards.
30,This is one of my old favorites but unfortunately I don’t think I will be back. The resort is getting very run down and everything from the ice machines to the lights in the rooms are starting to break. Staff was also not as friendly. Had a greasy check in experience but after that I felt like I was just a bother to them when I asked for resolution to issues. Love MGM properties but if this continues I will have to look elsewhere unfortunately
40,Second time here love the location rooms are clean casino is nice. Few more food options for gluten free would be good though. Staff is friendly. No issues with room noise or people partying. M rewards is nice could find 10 tables in mornings. Dealers were friendly and helpful
30,Our room had clothes on the floor and trash left in it from previous guest. Made us feel the room had NOT been properly cleaned. Contacted the front desk on two occasions and both times we were told we were not registered in the room so they could not assist us. Took three trips to the front desk to get it straightened out.
30,We had major problems with the mobile check in and couldn’t access our room. The wait to check in was at least an hour long with only one person assisting all of the people that couldn’t get their digital keys to work. The water temp in the shower kept changing regardless of the settings. Not outlets in the bedroom next to the bed and few avail in the room at all. No microwave. You need your key to access the elevators and cannot go to a floor other than your own. Made things difficult when we came with a large party.
30,I was there to celebrate my 53rd birthday I like the fact of the location was on the strip my room got change to the same exact room that was suppose to be an upgrade no free play for first time guest
10,None of the staff was helpful . The ones we can actually stop and question had horrible attitudes. Stay down the street for an extra 10$ a day at bellagio or cesars. The location is good but the way the staff treats you is not worth it.
40,We have stayed at other hotels and still do time from time. But our stay at the Mirage has always been our favorite. It has a great open layout and the staff is always around and checking on you to see if there is anything more they can do for you.
50,Great resort with lots of things to do and see without having to drive anywhere. Room was very nice and the bed was nice and comfy. Great restaurants too! Thoroughly enjoyed the scenery including the giant fish tank setting at the hotel check in area.
30,My trip to Mirage was disappointing to me on a few levels. I have history with Mirage that is pretty good and I want to love this place. However there are several reasons that I probably will not go back there and I will not recommend it to anyone else.    Let's start with the gaming. I play Blackjack and I don't play anything else. Mirage now pays 6:5 on a blackjack hand as opposed to the standard 3:2. That is a blatant money-grab from a casino that already has the odds of the game in their favor. With a payout of 6:5 it isn't even exciting to get a blackjack anymore. Sure it's a winning hand but the payout isn't special any more. Additionally there were more closed tables than there were open ones and there were more players than there were open tables to play on. Sometimes I like to be able to move from a table where the cards may not be too good to try another table. This was often not possible unless I wanted to wait a while for a seat. This is not acceptable at a resort such as Mirage.    Next about half of the restaurants were closed when it was time to eat breakfast lunch or dinner. The places that were open had wait times exceeding 30 minutes most of the times I inquired. In fact I was unable to eat a single meal in the resort without waiting at least 30 minutes or more for a seat.    Not to pile on but another issue I have with Mirage is that the rooms have become dated compared to their competition. The bathrooms are very small compared to other resorts in Las Vegas that are in the same price range as Mirage. The decor in the rooms is also dated. I can say that the mattress in my room was EXCELLENT and lines were fresh and clean (seemed new even).    The staff were friendly and helpful. Check in was quick and easy. Parking was FREE!
50,From the moment we arrived at the Mirage we were greeted by a friendly and professional staff. Our accommodations were comfortable and clean. Everyone from the front desk to the taxi area attendant were everything we could hope for.
20,Room has a 90's vibe. Cigarette burn hole in coach abstract art was tilted One tv did not work. Restaurants are closed or understaffed resulting in long waits and poor food. The mesh screens outside your window are beyond annoying!
50,Mobile check in didn't quite work as well as expected. But we had a great time and everything was great. Not Smokey and things were busy. We will definitely return because the pool location and on site gaming were just right for us
50,Not only will you have a great experience at The Mirage at their pool but you can also see their tigers and dolphin show at their secret garden. Not to mention the fact that the location is right on the strip and you’ll get to see the volcano show each night!
40,Stayed three nights starting 5/16/21 with 2 rooms. Rooms were nice modern comfortable and both were upgraded to views of the volcano/strip. We were really there for some warmth and fun in the sun. The pool area is beautiful and has an oasis vibe with lots of palm trees.    Be prepared to be in line for the pool at 9am or earlier if you want to pick your chairs. Or make cabana or premium seating reservations way in advance. Pool hours were 9am - 6pm so we missed some chill time on day one as we visited the Hoover Dam (which was amazing). On day two we spent the day at the pool and was a bit disappointed that the water was very cold. Most people were shocked at the temp. However we could feel some warm water coming in through some vents and by day four it was perfect.    Overall would stay there again as it is a beautiful property and pretty easy to get in and out of with a great location. Also parking was FREE so that is a win!
50,I stayed at The Mirage for the first last weekend and absolutely loved my stay. A few of the highlights for me included: gorgeous lobby didn't smell smokey beautiful pool easy access to restaurants and quick walking distance to other fun areas on the strip and a fabulous view from our room.    The highlight of my stay was renting 2 lounge chairs at the Private Oasis. The music was great the atmosphere chill and our server was super attentive. We never waiting long for food or drinks. I will definitely be staying again.
50,The rooms are big and clean. Restrooms are clean. Housekeeping are very nice and would ask you if you needed anything. They now have the option to mobile check in w/c allows you to skip the waiting when checking in. Plenty of free parking. There’s always elevators available.
40,My husband and I was in Las Vegas to celebrate our 45th wedding anniversary. We wanted to go to the places where we used to stayed in our younger years. We were happy to stay at the Mirage to bring back many happy memory.
40,We were placed here as part of a separate promotion but enjoyed our stay immensely. Th premises are lovely and rooms are spacious. We were a little surprised that we never saw a housekeeper and we placed a trash can outside our door hoping it would be collected--it was. Be prepared for prices above your regular haunts--craft beer though tasty is $10. There are numerous restaurants throughout the Hotel to be sure. Another curious thing was that there were no wash cloths in our room. Notwithstanding any criticism here we had a great time and enjoyed our stay. The local bus stops just outside the Resort so transportation is a breeze along the strip and elsewhere. You will never go hungry at the hotel but you might want to venture across the strip just outside the hotel where there are several breakfast stops and other eateries offering a wide variety of food.
10,They DO NOT have blackout curtains as advertised. They will charge you ridiculous charges that you do not incur. Just lacking hospitality. Spent a lot of money to stay for a week and celebrate my husband’s 50th birthday. He was definitely not impressed his first time in Vegas and I believe it was due to staying at the mirage.
40,Everything about the Hotel and Staff was first class. However in these post covid times. The food selection was awful the lines to get food were ridiculous and waiting in line for 40 minutes every morning for a cup of 12 dollar coffee is unacceptable. I played in the Casino about an average of 4 hours a day and many times never seen a wait staff person.
50,The Mirage was clean and reasonably priced. It was also in a great location. Even though I lost my butt gambling there I’d stay there again because of the cleanliness and location. Although most of the dealers could have been more friendly. A few were but most were like robots.
50,From bell service to check in and cleaning service. Everyone was very pleasant and helpful. Very respectful of sleep time and quiet and respectful when doing their job. Bell desk was very well informed and helpful during in providing information to guest.
10,Stay away from the mini bar! Don’t touch anything! You will be charged! We ate nothing and drank nothing yet our refreshment charges were more than the hotel bill for one night. I heard 3 other people commenting about being caught up in the same money scam. Ice machine on 22nd floor was broken. Hotel key card only lets you go to the lobby or to the floor of your room. We were one floor above my sister yet we couldn’t get to their room unless they met us in the lobby.
50,My husband and I have stayed at Mirage for yrs its like going home.  The Mlife program has always treated us fantastic. Our suite was very nice beds and pillows are so very comfortable and food options are very good and reasonably priced!
50,Great location to go every which way on the strip  overall clean organized hotel and Restaurants great staff with plenty of security clean comfortable rooms with very comfortable beds !! Also ice chess friendly hotel !!!
50,If you can’t have fun here then don’t bother leaving the house ever again. Was there for 72 hours and maybe slept 4 hours total. Casino was a blast all kinds of food options. Pretty much all you could ask for in a Vegas trip.
10,Terrible customer service I changed rooms three times the first time due to a water leak and the fire alarm the second because there was a party in the next room and then fight I tried to call the lobby and nobody answered and the hotel security did not know the woman in the lobby told me that the manager was going to communicate with me and he never did
10,Terrible place to stay I will never come back to the mirage or any Mlife casinos again. The staff were extremely aggressive toward my gay friend calling him horrible things and when I tried to stand up for him they kicked us out. You guys should be ashamed of yourselves!
50,Contactless Check-In was awesome! Rooms where clean. Location was great! Pre-check in email and did everything else on the App!  Room key on my phone didn't work but easily went to Lobby and printed my own key.
30,If you reserve the two bedroom suites pray you get the more updated ones with the newer decor. Also our suite didn’t have enough towels no robes and no extra toilet paper. We had to constantly call for these items but the staff did bring them quickly. Also the refrigerator didn’t work really well and the card reader on our door broke so we were locked out for a moment however the staff was helpful throughout all of these obstacles.
50,"If you're looking to have a great time but not in a loud party environment then The Mirage is your hotel! We went to some of the surronding hotels such as Cosmopolitan and it was loud! We went back to Mirage and things were mellow to our liking. AND pretty cool to be in the same hotel as ""Nick Papagiorgio""!"
10,I used to like this hotel. This visit the in-room safe didn't work. They never fixed it. The faucet in the bathtub/shower would not turn off. This was not just a drip but a steady stream of water. They never fixed it- Vegas is in an emergency droughr but whatever.... One of the towels had a hole in it. At Pantry for breakfast we waited 25 minutes to order and another 25 minutes for the food.    Really not a good experience.
40,Make sure to see the Volcano show out front. Not the best food on the strip but pretty good. Pay attention to all fees. It is worth it to rent a cabana or seating by the pool. Overall a great stay and right in the heart of the strip
50,the room was absolutely beautiful we were able to see the volcano show from our room the only things I had an issue with during our stay was a dirty towel was left on the floor of our bathroom upon check in & also hoping they open up valet parking like they do in the signature mgm would of been amazing to get our stuff taken up to our room the first night because bringing everything up ourselves was a nightmare! lol
40,However with the new “Covid” times there were some needs for improvement. No valet was awful for us as we had to carry our kids up to the room and then go back drive off property to oversized parking and walk 15 min to get back and also could not for two days get on the phone with the hotel at all. But I love staying at mirage the food was great drink service was easy the pool was a blast and we enjoyed our stay besides our two complaints that could easily be fixed by the hotel and save everyone a lot of time and frustration
50,I really enjoyed my stay at the Mirage casino the staff was very helpful. I loved all the amenities the hotel has to offer and the location is at the heart of the strip and very accessible to other casinos.
20,There was hair in my bathtub brown reside (poop) around my toilet three lightbulbs out in my room and when they fixed one they left a mess all over my counter top. Some of the staff was rude and there was a fraudulent charge of $88.00 made to my room at the pool bar. And numerous people screaming in the hallway along with extremely strong smell of marijuana on many occasions. Thank God for earplugs!
50,Great Hotel Staff  restaurants and Amenties! Would definitely recommend staying here. The pool is amazing. The one bedroom tower suite is awesome! Big bed big bathroom and huge living room. Very comfortable stay away from home!
50,Our stay at The Mirage was exceptional! For being our first time in Las Vegas we didn't know what to expect; however The Mirage made everything easy. We loved their amazing staff which were very helpful all day everyday and the beautiful hotel & casino where beautiful and fulfilled every one of our expectations!
10,After waiting 3 hours to check in the room was HOT and Stinky!!! If you called downstairs they don’t answer because they don’t have enough people to run the business. I canceled everything and went to another hotel with better treatment.
40,Hotel was nice and staff were friendly and professional. No coffee available until 6:30 AM when Starbucks opens so if you have an early flight make sure you get some the night before and maybe you can heat it on the volcano on the way out otherwise your screwed.
50,Staff were great and friendly all around. Was a great time. The high Deposit was a little surprise. Which ain’t a big deal but would like you guys to let the customer know of a 200 dollar deposit when booking the rooms.
50,It was a great experience celebrating my boyfriends son 21st birthday. And considering the masks and no masks it was a great trip and still felt comfortable with everything. I believe everyone should stay here once!!
30,Overall this hotel is nice. My hubby and I specifically go for the pool which I recommend hands down. We always get reserved seating or a cabana and have the best of times. Personally I think they should have sports betting in the cabanas.  The rooms were ok. Definitely showing their age and the showers are horrible for tall people (non stay well rooms). We also had some issues with lack of plugs for our cpap machines and the in room hairdryer did not work.  We also had to call maintenance for a shower that wouldn’t drain.
50,We stayed 2 nights at the mirage May 2021 and had the best time! The hotel was spotless all the time. No sticky banisters no fingerprints on the glass & they have taken every precaution to keep the hotel COVID clean! Perfect location for all attractions. We will stay here again!
20,Watch out for this place since you can pay for a booking with two separate beds and end up with one bed and a rollaway which makes you feel like you're in summers camp and 10 years old again. Terrible experience!
30,Their main pool area is very nice and spacious. The food and drinks were good as well. The staff throughout the hotel and casino was attentive and accommodating. It made the Vegas experience that much better!
20,The rooms smelled very musty the time we walked in. After the first day the sink would take forever to drain and then it just stop draining all together. The musty smell then turned into weed smell from the room next door. Really bad room.
40,The hotel is a beautiful place to stay and the staff are top notch.  Would give a perfect rating is the slot machine selection was anything above terrible. Will stay there again but never bet the slots again...better to play downtown.
40,Staff were friendly rooms.were clean and it was not overly crowded. On location restaurants were above average in price and below average in quality which was disappointing. The pool was clean and fun. Be aware that even with a discounted rate or $69/nt with taxes and resort fee the cost was still about $140/nt.
30,Just not at the level or service and quality they used to provide. I would think people should be happier they have a job. They don't answer phones so everything was done online from booking to checking in and out. Tried to reach guest services w times and was on the phone on hold both times over a hour and never got through. Was never helped by a human. Not good if you need help with something. Used to be more enjoyable there.
20,Extremely disappointed in this property..the smell of Marijuana was overwhelming...as soon as we left our room the smell hits you in the face all along the hallways.. the rooms are also extremely noisy the walls are paper thin..
50,I've said for 4 days for my birthday. As soon as I checked in St the front desk I could tell ot was going to be a great place. Rooms where very clean and updated. I felt very safe staying here. Will stay again.
50,We will definitely be staying at the Mirage again in the future. Our room was very clean and updated. The hotel is in a great location on the strip. Perfect for casino hopping and within walking distance to tons of stores and restaurants. The volcano erupting was cool to watch as well.
50,The rooms were very clean and very comfortable. Had everything we needed for a great stay. Maid service was on point. Very easy to get transportation to other hotels. Great recommendations for meals. Fun pool.
50,I hadn’t been in the last few years and after covid a trip was 100% necessary! It was an amazing stay! Beautiful casino great staff same as I remembered can’t wait to go back! Will absolutely be back soon!
30,As previously stated the hotel is less than expected. The room was below standard for a luxury hotel. The cocktail waitresses are less than professional possibly due to the lack of waitresses on at any given time. My biggest disappointment would be the Water pressure in the shower just terrible!!!
50,First time staying and it was an awesome experience! You can do some many things even before leaving the hotel and the food at the restaurants with high quality service can’t compare for the price at all !!
50,I’m definitely going back at the mirage. Their front desk were amazing and very helpful. Checking in is easy and fast. Our room is very clean and comfortable. Customer service was excellent. My only disappointment was I didn’t get to see the Volcano but it was because of the bad weather. Hopefully this year we gonna go again.
30,Our overall stay was not a good experience at all I would not recommend staying at this location. We definitely had more fun outside this casino. Not a lot for the kids to do. The slots weren't paying which was a bummer.
40,Sports lounge attendants could be more helpful. Did not take verbal bets. Made you fill out sheets. Breakfast at Pantry took 50 min to get breakfast with reservations. Limited tables. Only one Pai Gow table with 3 seats in whole casino. If it was due to Covid why not alternate tables. Will still stay here because of location and cleanliness of resort.
50,Wonderful experience. We have stayed at so many resorts on and off the strip but this was our first time at the Mirage.  Excellent location friendly accommodating staff and great food and bars within the hotel.  Easy check in process via app and checked out via app as well.  We had a blast at the adult  Pool and Cabanas and will rent that again when we return. Loved it all!
30,Cool casino close enough to strip we encounted some issues with our room bathroom and check out process. The beds were very comfortable and strip view room was not loud i got to get good rest. Had an okay stay here i thought it would be immaculate after the pandemic and it re opening our room was definitely not cleaned but made the best out of our stay.
50,Wonderful staff and reasonable rates. The location on the strip was excellent. Rhumbar lounge was an awesome experience. Staff was attentive and very friendly. I will definitely be back in the near future.
50,it was my first vacation our family had a great time hotel is very clean people were very professional Overall stay was excellent people were very friendly look forward to coming again in the fall Thank you
50,Great experience in the casino and the restaurants food was great. Fun and welcoming environment. Our entire family enjoyed themselves. Kids loved the pool and the convenience store was great. Cant wait to go back
50,Quick stay fast easy checking in n out prob stay at again another time very nice rooms n service was decent though nice staff and cleaniness of rooms n bathrooms were great  wish there were more pai gow tables but it was still good gambling
50,I loved the Mirage it wasn’t too crowded. Can hop in table games whenever. Dealers were a great help and friendly. The pool was a very nice experience. Loved watching the dolphin show as well. Staff every where was awesome.
40,Staff was nice friendly and helpful room was nice. I liked how it didn’t have a joining room the pool was a bit on the cold side and the room AC didn’t seem to get cold enough at it’s lowest temperature. Which is a problem when it wasn’t that hot yet only in the 80s.
40,Had a great time at the Mirage great location pool was very nice and plenty of room to find a spot in the morning. Easy to get around the hotel and had good restaurants for breakfast or just coffee..
50,The friendly and helpful staff overall cleanliness and location helped to make our stay very relaxing and enjoyable. On multiple days we enjoyed the pool and sitting poolside. The available restaurants had delicious food and great service.
50,The Mirage was exceptional  The towers suite overall setup was amazing but it really was the bathroom & view for me!!! It looks exactly like the pictures that they have posted online!!! My husband loved it
50,Great location and service. We would go to the Walgreens across the street for sunscreen and beers to take to mirage pool. Food was okay but could get seated quickly in a pinch. Table games were reasonably priced.
50,We had a wonderful stay. Relaxing and fun. The pool was great not overcrowded. Loved the eating options. We will be staying here again real soon. Staff was friendly and courteous. Checking in and out was simple.
20,Really disappointing property. Tiny room that was what I would expect at a comfort inn and about as well kept. Hallway exceptionally loud all night long and had bags of trash in it most of the day. Service was non existent after check in. Very few restaurants and bars on the property open.
50,Great hotel very clean and beautiful rooms. House keeping came and cleaned the room numerous times and gave clean towels. Check in was very smooth and fast. Would defend recommend. The pool was beautiful and everyone was so sweet and helpful.
30,Everything was pretty great including the staff and environment but our room flooded and backed up and causes a mess so we had to move in the middle of the night. The room was a bit dirty to start with but we were trying not to complain before the floor was soaked. We were moved quickly but were offered no compensation for the inconvenience and considering the amount we payed to stay in one of their Stay Well rooms it would have been nice.
30,This is the first time at the Mirage in about seven years and I have to say the hotel Is not the same. You still get a clean room. And the location is prime. But I have to say I understand Covid it is still an issue but the restaurant situation is pricey and very limited. For instance me and my dad had breakfast at the pantry and he came to $56 for two eggs each. I can’t understand why they make this a money grab. We then proceeded to Danny’s across the street the next day and only paid $20. The other restaurant that was open was snacks had about three or four selections once again very pricey and the quality of the food was poor no waitress at this location Felt like I was in a cafeteria proceeded to the pool for Two large margaritas total cost $43. I understand we all on vacation and price may not be a matter but this hotel without the Buffet California pizza made it difficult for meals. The rooms are still clean and the pool was extremely crowded you had to get there at 8:30 just to get a seat overall that you could add another stor If you were just looking for a location I doubt I would return to this hotel there are others on the strip that a more reasonable. Oh yeah in addition slots are limited it seems they pulled a lot of them out very small selection of slot machines
40,The location was great. Rooms were okay - need to update bathrooms (layout was a bit awkward with door opening into 2nd sink and shower door didn’t close so water got all over the floor while showering). Super easy to get a cab to the airport ($27 ride each way).
40,The hotel itself was very nice very accommodating the people were nice the staff was nice but you have to have virtual check-in therefore there was no staff to explain to me where my room was and that we had to have reservations to even go swimming I had to find this out by not being able to go swimming on my vacation because we didn’t make reservations far enough in advance but they still charge me the resort fee even though I didn’t use any of the amenities
50,Thanks for an excellent stay. The resort was wonderful and loved the atmosphere. We will definitely be back. Our favorite thing was the pool area and volcano show. The volcano snow is a must see when in Vegas.
10,Two bedroom penthouse and hospitality suite dirty and disgusting. Blood on sheets dirty towels left showers that don’t turn on clogged sinks just to name a few or the many issues we had and do not expect any COVID safety protocols.
20,An old wash rag was left hanging and the tub drain didn't work. Evrytime I showered the tub would fill up and take a while to drain after. I had only two wash rags and four towels left in the bathroom when I arrived.
20,The entire city was dirty sticky and not appealing to visit. Mirage rooms were not up to standard of clean and get this. “RESORT” fee of $44.00 a day then they tax the fee an additional $4.00. Not going back.
40,I gave them a four only because of the lack of open restaurants during my weekday stay. Otherwise it’s a great place to stay. The rooms are nice as well as the service and the casino is huge. Overall very nice.
50,Highly recommend staying here at The Mirage. Lots of things to do inside places to eat and the gambling experience was awesome. The drinks are very reasonable and we enjoyed an afternoon at the pool with great friends.
40,For being now open for 20+ years the Mirage still has the look and feel of a quality resort. The interior of the casino resort did not look or feel dated.Pool area was nice. Only negative is the buffet restaurant is still closed.To make it safe just limit the number of people and a time limit.
40,Check in was remarkably easy and rapid. Food at steakhouse was excellent and prices seemed lower than previously. Essentials store prices were excessive for multiple items. I enjoy Starbucks but some type of in room coffee would make getting out of bed easier.
50,We had and excellent stay at the Mirage!  We had a resort tower room 24th fl. with a private elevator for 24th and 25th fl.  Quiet room at night great view of strip and pool! Food was beyond great!  El Diablo cantina was out first meal there 2 thumbs up! We also ate at the Pantry for breakfast and the Paradise cafe by the pool was so convenient you can go directly to the pool! Snacks was also a big help with a quick breakfast. Many other places to eat and barely a wait time!  No masks this time at the pool was a BIG plus! One of our most enjoyable stays in Vegas!!!
40,Mobile check in / out is the way to go! It was nice to avoid the lines. Great casino! Vallet parking was'nt going but the parking structure was close and organized. The room was beautiful and very clean! We had a fantastic time and will be back again soon.
50,This was my second stay at the mirage and it was just as pleasant as last time. While I did find it harder to get drinks even though I always tipped well I did have one cocktail waitress who kept them coming but she unfortunately had off my last 2 days of my stay. Most of the pit bosses were jerks with the exception of 1 or 2 but overall I would stay here again or at least another mgm owned property!
50,Rooms were really nice for the price. I got a 2 queen strip room and was shocked at how much room was in there. Compared to MGM Grand (10 years ago) these are pretty big. Also I could actually open the window for some air. Seriously better than expected and highly recommended.
40,Great and clean rooms at a good price but they had one casual restaurant  Not many choices in restaurants  The dolphin habitat and the pool made the trip over the top  Had a strip view  Would recommend Diablos for Mexican fare
40,Nicely located on the strip. Didn’t need our car once we arrived at the Mirage. Was able to walk the strip in either direction and visit other casinos. The tram was a few steps outside providing service to the Treasure Island next door saved a few steps! Nice size deluxe guest rooms I recommend the strip view.
30,I've been staying at MGM resorts for years but this was my stay at the Mirage it's a great show off resort a lot to do and see and I've also stayed at 2 other property's it a lot like the Luxor fun but showing it's age and the rooms are in need of upgrade
50,The housekeeping staff were helpful and maintained clean room.The staff at front of hotel were friendly and courteousall floor staff gave great directions for whatever I needed to go. Thanks to all.Love staying here my first time at the mirage. I stayed at many other hotels on the strip.MIRAGE was a great experience.
40,Rooms are old and show their ware. They were clean however. Staff friendly and helpful. Pool was great! Had some trouble getting a drink in the casino one of the nights. Some restaurants closed during the week so had to go somewhere else for dinner a couple of nights.
50,Our first stay at the Mirage and we will be back! Great property location and very classy! The pool was wonderful! We don’t gamble much but there was a variety of slot machines available and all were clean. We did not see beverage service frequently however.
50,The mobile check in is the way to go. Bypassed the line and got right to my room. Staff was friendly except for the security who kept telling us to pull up our masks. The prices are way higher than they used to be but that is understandable. The food from The Pantry was delicious and the staff there were super friendly. I know it will be better as more people are hired. There seems to be a staff shortage which makes it harder to get served. Overall...great stay!!
40,This is a nice hotel with a few flaws which are understandable coming out of a pandemic. The service on the casino floor is severely lacking. 2 girls working the whole floor so don't expect drinks. There is no live entertainment or anything else to do here at night besides slot machines or blackjack. MGM closed down their poker rooms permanently for some reason. The hotel was not as close to the heart of the strip as we would've liked. We spent a small fortune in Ubers. It's a very long walk to anything. I would recommend staying at MGM Grand. Live music everyday and much bigger. New York New York was fun too. The Mirage is nice but had to go elsewhere with my 77 year old mother for entertainment. Unless you want to play the smaller casino every night. Our trip was 7 days.
10,This is based off of the room only. The room had a sticky kinda dirty feel and the sheets felt dirty. The inside of the mattresses were worn. The outer side was firmer so you could tell that it just had been slept on too much.
50,Great place for our first trip to Vegas. We were there for my brothers wedding. Kinda overwhelmed. Extremely disappointed with Heritage Steak. We are foodies and my daughter made reservations to take my brother and his new wife out. Spent a fortune for a subpar dinner. Otherwise the hotel was great
50,Amazing hotel the staff was welcoming and friendly the pool area the best pool ever the pool staff was amazing and the service was wonderful I would be coming back very soon had a wonderful time my family and friends enjoyed the vacation
40,Only downside was no quick grub on property. Pool was great location on the strip is pretty good. Easy to get to other properties. Restaurants looked alright but none were enticing enough to keep us from going to other properties for lunch and dinner.
50,We had a great time (other than losing money in the machines) and the property is beautiful. The rooms were very Clean too. Make sure you visit the Dolphin Bar at the pool. We will definitely be back soon.
50,Loved the pool. All accessible. Freindly staff. Nice room with great view. Center of the strip. Restaurants nearby safe elevator. Clean machines and tables. Starbucks is a plus specially in the morning.
30,We've stayed at Mirage the last 4-5 visits. This is our Hotel of choice. We've been coming to Vegas once a year/sometimes twice. We have stayed in almost every hotel on the strip. Mirage is our favorite. This visit though we stayed in the Queen Tower room. It's in need of renovation badly. The carpet and furniture is filthy and stained. We recommend the Mirage highly but don't stay in the QueenTower rooms.
40,To be quite honest the hotel was pretty good. It had all the amenities I needed and price was reasonable. Rooms should be renovated and modernized…bathroom was very big and the bed was comfortable…unfortunately it is a long walk to the guest elevators
50,The view was amazing everything was rite next to us well kept rooms very clean and neat staff was very friendly and prompt the food is so flavorful and delicious the pool was gorgeous and very clean
50,This place is awesome from the staff to how clean everything is. We might be the odd ducks but 90% of our time is spent strictly at this hotel and casino. All the restaurants are great with service and food quality. Highly recommend paying the additional cost for the private oasis Ariel and Danielle are the a best waitresses around.
40,We love the Mirage but the in-room experience could have been better. Some of the furniture and fixtures are a little worn. There were parties at all hours of the night - which is fine it's Vegas post-quarantine and people need the release. But then when we're trying to sleep in the staff comes around and is loud out in the hallway. The pool experience was fantastic as were the casino and sportsbook.
50,The Mirage is an excellent hotel to stay at when visiting Las Vegas! It is in a great sport on the Las Vegas Strip the staff is attentive and the rooms are clean. Although we didn't use the pool it did seem to be better than a lot of the surrounding resorts.
50,We love The Mirage for it's central strip location and easy in and out right to the street. The value for what you get at The Mirage is second to none - large clean rooms - large casino with lots of options - friendly staff.
40,Great time Mlife gave us some bad information but I don't blame them I think they didn't know. It was my wifes Bday and I asked if they had bday play. They said to go to the Luxor Excaliber and MGM. Took a cab fair to the far end of the strip only to find out they don't give bday play anymore. Waste of time and $.
20,Been there twice and machine were to tight couldn’t even make it fun. There were seven of us and nobody had fun and spent a lot of money. I know it a business but at least they would make it fun for people and let them play for a while on there money but machine eat it up to quick. Spent a lot and had no fun. I know where coming off a prendimic and everyone lost money but to keep your poeple coming back it’s gotta be enjoyable
20,Being new to Las Vegas and wanting to celebrate graduating college the experience was overall poor due to multiple of reasons    1. When we got there the clerk at check in gave us the wrong room as I was expecting a Volcano room as I had paid for but instead I got a room that wasn’t even cleaned nor did it have a working TV. (Although they did compensate us with a 4 person $25 voucher to any restaurant in the Mirage.)    2. After they rectified their mistake and did give us the right room are key cards did not even work as we had to not only go back to the previous room and carry our Luggage to the new room we needed to wait for security to open up our room! Once in there the room smelled musty even better when we got another new key cards only one worked! At that point my party and I just stopped caring to even get this issue fixed in frustration of them messing up again…    3. Finally when our check out day was here we were rudely awakened by house keeping two hours before asking if we knew that our time to check out by was at 11am! And when we did go to check out the kiosk didn’t even work so we had to just drop our cards in a little box and call the desk wondering if we would get our deposit back or not..
20,"Having been to the Mirage previously I would say that this stay was below expectations.    Check in: This process has been made fairly straight forward especially with the ""MGM Resort"" app on our phone. Digital key was sent right away when we arrived. I did have a chance to interact with the front desk and they were very friendly and pleasant.    Rooms: We had a tower king room. This was nice because we had our own separate elevator (Floors 24 & 25). There was never a wait to get into the elevator and they came fast. The room overall was clean and tidy. It was nice to have a high level view of the Volcano and a portion of the strip. Main issues that we had were the lack of outlets available in our bedroom. We had one working outlet and no working USB hubs by the office desk. There were no outlets or USB hubs by the bed. No other outlets were available in the main room. Unfortunately we woke up to less than 20% battery on our phones after finding out the outlets did not work. There was one outlet by the room door that was popping out of the wall.    Our bathroom shower door did not close fully and kept opening (half an inch opening). We ended up pointing the shower head towards the opposite corner so we didn't have a wet floor after showering. Not a huge deal for us.    The ice machine on our floor did not work and we weren't able to access other floors to retrieve ice. Good security.    Staff were very nice and apologetic when we voiced our concerns.    There was an Uber/Lyft area for pick up which we used (TIP: make sure to order rideshare services at least 20-30 minutes before anticipated leave time as finding drivers was very limited)    There was also a taxi line by one of the doors which we also used a few times. Fares were comparable to Uber/Lyft but more expensive.    The casino at the mirage was great tentative staff clean and not too crowded. All casinos we visited enforced mask wearing which was great to see.    Overall the Mirage is still a great place to stay for it's location decent rooms and friendly staff. I am hoping that they revamp some of there rooms for future guests."
20,Are used to be great and it was always a good time when we stayed this time it was complete crap the room smelled like mildew the air conditioner wasn’t cold it was cold in the hallway than it was in the room. The bathroom had hair in the shower that wasn’t mine so they obviously didn’t clean it right the pay for snacks in the room had a layer of dust on them so obviously they didn’t clean those either. On the second night an alarm went off and went and stopped for a while so that was annoying because you could hear it in your room. Took about 20 minutes to check in receptionist said she’d be back in a minute it took her about 15 minutes to go and I guess open up a room for us even though she had just talk to someone else in my party that got a room and she literally put a room two doors down so how do you need to release it if you were already informed of the same problem. Last problem housekeeping on the day of checkout comes knocking on my room door until I answer it out of asleep to inform me that check out is at 11 AM like I don’t have an alarm or that I’m not a child I didn’t asked to be woken up so that was rather rude and when we called downstairs to ask why this was happening they said it’s they’ve been doing that why why do you need to do that to your customers that have paid for the room they don’t need to be treated like a child unless they’ve asked can I get a a wake up call. So next time I go to Vegas I won’t be staying here and I will tell anyone who will listen to me find another place it’s around the same price as every other hotel so might as well just go to another place that they are going to treat you like a child by waking you up and they probably are going to better room that the air-conditioning will work.
50,I recently stayed at the Mirage Hotel and Casino with another couple. We absolutely loved it! We got a great deal on our room 85% off; therefore we splurged and got a two-bedroom tower suite. If you can do it highly recommended. The staff is very accommodating when wanting to set-up any specialties during our stay (transportation bell hop etc.).    Beware that you do need to wear a mask EVERYWHERE inside this establishment besides your hotel room. Even if you are smoking eating drinking.... you need to put your mask back up between drags bites and sips. Staff is very persistent in scolding.
30,Casino was nice. Great friendly staff all the way around. The bathroom was moldy all along the ceiling and corners. There was old hair from pasts guests (3 types of different hair) so I know the shower hasn't been cleaned well for a while . Shower head sprayed water all over the floors leaving puddles.
50,Before we left for vacation to the Mirage I read some negative reviews which had me concerned. We had no issues so I have no idea what they were talking about. We did the mobile check in which was a breeze. They even had two staff members near by to help people download the app. if needed. We picked the Mirage because of the pool and it was amazing. A few of the reviews we read talked about not having enough seats at the pool. We arrive a little before the pool opened and had no trouble at all. I saw people get there a little later and found lounges as well. They may not have been pool side but close enough. The cocktail waitresses were friendly and plentiful. We made dinner reservations in advance and were seated promptly every night. There were lines for breakfast at the Pantry. One hint that I'd suggest is to have breakfast at the restaurant by the pool. It seemed many people aren't aware of this option so its less crowded and the food was amazing! We stayed in a king tower room which was very clean and the AC worked well. The only negative we found was the wifi wasn't great but overall a wonderful place to stay  Hope you enjoy your stay at the Mirage as much as we did.
50,Stayed here three nights in May 2021. I have typically stayed at the Mirage. Services like room service were still reduced and that was a pain. Crowd was good and mask restriction enforced. Like staying here because location is good. May begin trying some other properties though. Visited The Venetian and seemed more upscale.
50,We had a great time at Mirage in early May. Facility is very nice and clean & staff works hard to make your stay enjoyable. Looking forward to seeing more of their restaurants reopening full time. Highly recommend the Mirage!
50,We always stay at the Mirage and we love it. The location is prime for anywhere you want to be on the strip. Close to shopping and food. We ate at all the restaurants in the Mirage and all of the meals we ate were excellent just a little pricey. Just got home and now planning our next trip.
10,Room was obviously not cleaned there was a joint on the desk no personal fridge only mini bar that you aren't allowed to use. During the day time atleast during covid food options at this hotel is very limited.
50,Took my mom to celebrate Mother's Day and had a really good time. It was a very pleasant experience going back. Hopefully I can make it back in the next 60 days. I have friends going to Las Vegas soon and I may go with them and stay at the Mirage.
50,Rooms are very clean. Some much to do in the resort. Pool area is awesome. Staff was great. Very scenic hotel. Great places throughout hotel to take pics. Don't use the bar inside your room $18 4 H2O!
40,Stay was great. Lots to do. Property was clean. Most staff members were friendly. Clean and smoke free rooms in the stay well section. Loved the pool. Check in was easy via cellphone. Self parking available. Rates were decent.
50,Very awesome time my Wife enjoyed herself thoroughly. An the service was top notch. Can't wait for the next trip to Vegas I also loved the pool with the waterfall natural water massage. An very beautiful pool area.
50,My room was clean modern and didn’t stink. The bed was comfortable. The central bar was my favorite spot to lounge and grab a drink before going out to do any of my activities. They took $20 from me but I probably should have put it on red instead of black. Will definitely be staying here again.
10,We checked in for a long weekend and have always loved the Mirage - The rooms are extremely outdated had mold and dirty bathroom. the App check in process is very disorganized and time consuming. Employees seem disengaged and unhappy
40,I lost my purse upon arrival. Security and Lost and Found a called me the next morning and let me know they found it! Everything was intact—all my money ID credit cards etc. Honest people never employees do exist! I am so thankful! Rooms are clean bed was comfy room was cleaned each day in a timely manner. Pool had a waiting line and machines were expensive and tight. All in all it was a great hotel and I would stay here again!
50,The hotel and casino was great. Perfect location on the strip. King room was update and clean. Staff always greeted you in the hallways. The dolphins were amazing. The pool has multiple waterfalls I suggest renting the day beds. We will be back!
40,Front desk staff was friendly and exceptionally helpful  Love the pool area plenty of chairs and good wait staff by using code at your chair; makes it easy to order drinks or food  Housekeeping was punctual and our room was always clean and towels restocked
30,The Mirage had been my go to Vegas resort. I loved it. But it appears that they have neglected to maintain the premises over the years. This was a 6 room Mothers' Day weekend with 14 family members (1-800 Dad Pays) so we dropped a pretty penny for this trip. Fortunately the children and grandchildren were in great spirits which enabled us to overcome the flaws in the facility. MGM needs to invest to restore this former treasure OR risk losing its following.
30,Hotel seems a bit run down from my last visit. Casino was pretty dead and played the blackjack tables and never saw a waitress / waiter for a drink. The room was a bit dirty and bathtub didn’t drain very well. The pool was great great service from staff so we spent most our time pool side.
50,The resort was busy but we still got a good parking spot. The check in line was full but we moved through it quickly. Our room was clean and ready. At the Diablo resturant the bar tender/waiter was friendly and gave us many recommendations to do things at the resort. The food was outstanding and they made some accommodations for my wife and I for some specialty items. Thank you Michael!!!!
20,This was my first trip to Las Vegas and I was very excited to stay at the Mirage because I had heard about the hotel most of my life.    The mobile check-in was a great added feature and it was very easy to check-in and to use the digital key. However I was unable to transfer a digital key to my wife because of the requirement to use the ID.me portal (the system was unable to process any photo that she took of her driver's license). As a result we had to go back downstairs to print a key for her. That process went OK but there was a semi-long and very disorganized line at the mobile check-in kiosk desk. It took much longer than it should have to print the keys because the wait was so disorganized.    I had previously used ID.me because I’m a veteran and I used it to obtain my veteran’s ID card. I thought about gong to the desk to get the upgraded M Life card but the experience with the key printing steered me away from doing that. We had a short time in town and I didn’t want to spend too much of it standing in line for that card.    The hotel was generally clean but not as new or as clean looking as some of the nearby hotels that we visited on our trip. The Venetian Caesar's Palace The Belaggio etc. all looked much nicer inside.    While gambling at the Mirage casino we were NEVER approached about drinks (free or otherwise) which is something I've never encountered in a casino even in Tunica MS.    We usually take stairs while in hotels but we found that the stair nearest our room was an Emergency Exit only but was NOT labeled as such from the hallway. After we entered the stairwell there was no entry back to our floor (the door was locked) so we had no choice but to continue through the long hallway (600 feet long?) leave through the exit door and be escorted back through the hotel by security.    We had to call the front desk to have toilet paper delivered on the third day of our stay because housekeeping left none…on two days of room cleaning…no replacement toilet paper was left.    There were some positive aspects however just not enough to offset these negatives.    We did find the room comfortable and quiet and the bartended at the bar nearest the check-in made a great caipirinha. We also enjoyed the Italian restaurant downstairs quite a lot.    The Avis rental desk was very helpful and the no-additional-charge parking for our rental car was greatly appreciated.    All-in-all however we’ll definitely choose another hotel next time we vis
40,Have always enjoyed the Mirage. Wish the casino was a bit larger though. Rooms are more than descent staff always ready with a hello and you can't beat the location. Absolutely love The Pantry never disappointed
50,My best friend of over 40 years Birthday Bash in Vegas was great! The Mirage made it even better! Thanks Mirage and all your staff! Will be returning with just the wife for our recharge in this fast pace life of ours.
40,The Mirage resort is as advertised. From the restaurants to the entertainment there’s no need to leave the resort if you choose to do so. The only situation we encountered had to do with the check in/out on the app. I realize that lines at the front desk are always going to be long but once we made it through the situations were handled quickly and efficiently. Resort itself 5 star minus one for the app features that are meant to Expedite valuable time but great in person staff made up for it.
10,I have stayed here at the Mirage before and it is typically my hotel I first look at when I want to go to Vegas but this time did not do it for me it was a bad experience and I will be thinking about other hotels now when going to Vegas
40,Hotel was clean and in pretty good condition staff were mostly friendly and helpful. The bed was awful. Very uncomfortable. Tossed and turned all night. The pool is nice but unless you get there right when it opens don't expect to get a chair and the cost to reserve 2 of their premium chairs with umbrella is ridiculously high.
50,Arrived early due to an early flight and was so thankful my room was ready. This was my first time staying at Mirage and it was absolutely amazing!! Great service ate at Heritage Steakhouse Snacks and Costa and the food at all places was fantastic. Already can't wait to come back!!
20,Sorry to say this trip to the strip this month was not what we expected (we live in Vegas)The room was supposed to be an upgraded from a regular room really not what I would not call that an upgrade( we are gold members we have over 100000 points next 200000 ) compared to other hotels we stay at on the strip.ALSO NO FOOD to be had after 8pm  really we are at a place where people gamble ! Most times we start to play after a great meal  not here ! And if you are hungry at 2:00 am  FORGET IT. You can go up to your room and order room service ( at crazy prices ) and end the night or you could go across the street and get mugged ! When we went across the street we were accosted not by one but three drug dealers when we were not more then 20 feet from front door still on there property with a lot further to go before reaching the public sidewalk with no security in site
50,Would recommend to anyone that will be visiting. The hotel was very clean and provided phenomenal customer service. always provided the best help when we needed it and I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting
50,4 day trip to Vegas. Was upgraded to a stay well room on the 12th floor. Room is nice. Bed is a bit to form but overall was very happy with the room.  We used the pool area extensively. Day 1. Main pool and used the general open chairs. Overall decent. Day 2 rented chair at the oasis pool. This area was nice and quite. No kids in this area. Day 3 rented a cabana at The BARE pool. Overall was pretty good. My first experience in renting was great. Main pool is a bit small. It was pretty crowded. VIP area was not rented so they allowed the cabana rentals to utilize the pool in that area which overlooked the main pool. Staff was great and we all ate and drank well all day.  Gaming. Well the table limits were quite high. Mins for BJ were $15. Covid has reduced the amount of tables this limited this higher limits. Hotel was not busy Tuesday -Thur. Friday night seemed like normal vegas.
10,I used about 165.00 in reward points towards my room. They were never credited and young girl on phone had no idea what to do. I emailed and called with no response. M life rewards also could not help me. Check your bill before leaving they do not have any idea what to do to fix the problem after your gone.
50,I was saying was absolute amazing love the pool love the rooms love the staffing the food was absolutely amazing and the Italian restaurant we went to and also amazing and Diablos Mexican food the gift shop had everything we needed easy access with Walgreen straight across the street
40,Our stay was great with the acceptation of room service and all the restaurants closing early. The rooms desperately need and update but I didn’t complain because I had a great rate. Overall it was a nice clean environment.
40,Enjoy the room the hotel staff and The Secret Garden. The pool was great and pool staff was awesome. I wish there were refrigerators in the rooms instead of a setup; there are snacks for over $18 and if you touch or move them you would be charged these amounts.
50,Over the past 10 or so years I have stayed at a number of places - and this truly at the Mirage was the most exceptional experience that I have had. Great bellmen clean room exception non-contact check-in process
50,The Mirage gave my girlfriend and I an amazing experience for her first time in Las Vegas.  My dad and I frequently visit Las Vegas but stay at another location. We will be staying at the mirage or another m life hotel moving forward.  This trip and the service we were provided within the mirage certainly secured an m life member for life! :)
50,I was extremely happy with the entire experience never have I enjoyed a stay like I did with the mirage experience I was 100 percent satisfied the food was excellent the employees were extremely friendly and the check in was extremely easy with no problems
30,Rooms in need of repairs. Lots of slamming doors at night and noisy neighbors. Restaurant selection lacking. Gambling experience and selection of machines is average. Casino smells of smoke and air freshener trying to cover it up.
30,It was very nice however upon arrival when I walked into the room there was a leakage coming from the bathroom ceiling. It was heavily flooded on the bathroom floor. So I called the front desk and told him about it they said that we were going to get someone sent up to check it out but no one came because it was backed up. So we ended up switching rooms which is something that we did not want to do since we didn’t want to go anywhere below the floor that we were staying on but unfortunately we had to go on the floor below us.
50,The hotel is centrally located on the strip. The rooms are very nice and spacious. The pool is amazing and so relaxing with the waterfalls The check in and check out was easy. Will definitely stay here again.
40,Loved the view of the volcano! Wish the blankets and pillows were nicer. The ice machine didn’t work and heard from others the machine was out on their floors as well. Wish we had a mini fridge to store leftovers instead of a stocked fridge we couldn’t touch.  The pool was very relaxing and beautiful!! Got to experience the dolphin exhibit. Had fun in the casino and won some on the penny slots although lost it elsewhere. Overall a great experience!
50,Overall a great place to stay. We have booked again and recommend to some friends. In the future I would hope that the Mirage would take care of us again and maybe provide additional services to make sure that we are very happy and we have an enjoyable experience
40,If you want to spend the day at the pool this is the one to be at.  All staff in the pool area were exceptional. With 500 lounge chairs we always found a seat. Negative is the narrow hours. Would like to see the pool open until 8pm.
10,I had a 3 night stay May 2021. We paid an up charge for the tower rooms. My room was dirty dusty and had remains from the last guest left behind in it. Two others from my party had the same issue and had to be moved 3 times before getting a clean room.
50,Fine casino/resort with good restaurants good selection of slots and professional helpful staff. This property is kept very clean and I often saw staff cleaning machines right after someone had left them. I felt very safe and relaxed at The Mirage.
50,This was our first stay at the Mirage. The service room location and food choices were excellent. Everyone was nice and professional. It is very easy to get in and out of. The pool is huge but it was very crowded. You have to get there early to get a chair.
30,Rooms decent—wall outlets not useful (anything plugged in automatically pops out) shower tiny & shower head not easy to use; rooms decent and service only “decent” by check-in/check-in staff. Otherwise ok.
50,Let me start by saying WOW!!! So glad they’re back open! customer service was second to none! everyone we came in contact with were absolutely delightful! The room was very nice and updated! Issues with the AC and ice machines but front desk was awesome and resolved! Only complaint is there is no room service. The pantry advertises 24 hour service but it was closed by 9-10. So food in the resort was hard to come by for late night snack.
50,I was amaze as how well kept the mirage rooms are. For the age of the hotel furniture is nice. The room smelled nice and as I walked in I felt the room was clean. By far the cleanest room I stayed in on the strip
20,Room was very muggy. Called the front desk to have issue resolved. Maintenance guy came up to fix the problem. The air started blowing cold but it then went back to how it was. Very uncomfortable to sleep
10,They offer 4 handicap spaces on each parking level. Every level was half empty but the handicap spaces were completely filled daily. Requested walk in shower and got a tub. The bathroom was rusted on the bath and disgusting around the edges.
30,Travel there for a family event we all stayed there. Thought their hamburgers were overpriced. Ended up going across the street to in in an out for a better burger. The issue with the security guards at the pool I thought was unreasonable. The rules in apply to everyone some people had a mass on some people didn’t. But the security would just pick and choose. No announcement That mask had to be worn. Then was told if I order a drink I didn’t have to wear a mask. Very inconsistent.
50,We stayed at the Mirage for 3 nights recently. Everything about our stay was wonderful and the hotel is in a good location to get to other places nearby. Hotel staff were friendly everything was clean.
50,The pool is incredibly nice. The room was clean and the service great. I liked everything about the place except that the lines for Starbucks sucked. And there was no coffee in the rooms and no other coffee takeout open when we were there!
40,Very good value for money. Some restaurants closed which created long lines at opened restaurants. Masks required at pool which was not necessary. Was able to check in digitally so didn’t have to wait in line at lobby.
50,My last stay was comped at the mirage property and i thoroughly enjoyed the stay. The Beatles show in there hotel is an amazing show good MGM property; it’s Not Bellagio but it’s definitely worth a stay. Amazing spa if you get the time to enjoy it!
50,Stayed at this hotel for the first time. It was a pleasant surprise. The staff were pleasant and helpful. Our room was nice however bathroom was small. Great variety of machines to play and very clean.
20,See above noted many updates need to happen. Hotel is beautiful and well taken care of on the outside. Rooms need attention. Casino players need to have more attention. Waited on cokes at slot machines for over an hour.
40,Mirage is a nice hotel with a big casino plenty of bars & things to do. The pool is pretty big with several bars as well as wait staff. Location is great pretty much walking distance to other casinos restaurants and entertainment.
40,My wife and I stayed here as a quick weekend getaway. It was my firs time staying at Mirage but won't be my last. It's showing some signs of aging but the pool and property overall are great. We'll definitely go back.
50,This resort was very nice to me and my family. We took our kids on a family trip and they enjoyed every moment. My room was on strip view where I was able to enjoy the volcano show right from it. I would definitely come back and visit.
50,Can't beat the location! Clean and large rooms. Friendly and helpful staff. Great pools! Close to great dining and drinks. Check out the volcano! Easy to navigate and loved the elevators for designated floors- made getting to the room faster and easier.
40,First time being able to travel to Las Vegas in a few years. Mirage has always been my favorite hotel. While service was incredible the rooms are showing their age. It was disappointing to see that is no longer the first class place I've come to expect.
50,Such an amazing family experience from the room to the casino and the pool was such an easy and friendly place to spend as a family. My wife and I ended up winning 680.00 each on quick hit. Love that game!
20,Leaky toilet bad view of floor 2 .. did online check I. Because line very long to check in. Extremely long lines for everything and almost no chairs at pool. No lockers at pool either...water presssure was so high my boyfriend couldn’t shower because he was sunburnt and it was so strong. Good location but disappointed with everything else. I would of complained about the bathroom but it would of took forever. Also no lockers at pool??? Wtf. For 430$ 2 nights... stay somewhere else
40,We were at the end of the hall so a long walk but worth it because it was quite but when we got in the carpet by the window was so dusty you could write your name in it. We moved the chair and there was an empty beer bottle. Wouldn’t you move the chair when vacuuming. The maid was down the hall and very kind and came in and vacuumed and apologized and said the room was empty for a while and this the dust.
40,Overall nice place to stay for the value. Great pool you do have to get out there early to get a seat when they are busy!! Nice casino. Rhumbar has a great outdoor place to chill and have drinks but no food. Friendly staff!
50,Went there for my wife’s 40th birthday had a great time. The pool was awesome casino was decent size hotel room was great we upgraded to a bigger room which was nice. Overall we loved this location and will be back again!
30,Way too far from the strip itself. Walk from the room to the strip sidewalk was about 10-15 mins depending on walking speed & elevator traffic.overall hotel is nice clean and casino is spacious but the rooms are small simple no real Luxuries even at their prices $200 a night stay. Lastly their room service claims to be open 24hrs but my wife couldn’t reach anybody there at 2am.
10,If you are under 30 and book a room at the Mirage I highly recommend you go somewhere else. Management will only dismiss you if you go to them with an issue and will try to blame someone else for the problem. The rooms are nice but if you ask for your room to be cleaned daily make sure you check the sheets for everything. Don’t ask a manager for help with that as well they won’t do anything to help you. And if by chance they do it will take them up to 2 HOURS to help.
50,The mirage was a excellent hotel and I will definitely be staying there again very soon!!! The quality of the hotel was excellent and the staff were very friendly and informative. I would recommend to anyone.
50,An amazing hotel! The amenities are amazing great restaurants and WONDERFUL STAFF! The pool is to die for! Drinks are made VERY WELL! Access for the disabled is AMAZING (no issues getting around) will be coming back again!
30,It was an ok hotel. Loved the pool. Rooms had issues. Air conditioning would not shut off; no one ever came to fix. Finally switched rooms. Our belongings got stuck in the safe and it took them over an hour to get our stuff out causing us to miss reservations.
50,This hotel is located near everything checking in and out was a breeze very clean rooms helpful and friendly staff the stores have everything you need if you forget something beds are so comfortable this is my favorite hotel so far!!
10,We booked 4 rooms... 3 of the 4 were entered between 8:44am-10am the morning of check out. All rooms were entered with zero notice as they opened the door while knocking. Extremely concerning and a very uncomfortable feeling. We even called in the night before and requested a noon checkout. Why in the hell are they attempting to come into our rooms so early in the AM well before the standard checkout time?
30,Room was not as advertised unfriendly employees. For the cost I feel like the service should have been better. The bell hop was the most friendly and I didn’t even require his service. He said I look lost and tried to help me!
40,Great location easy mobile check in . Pool was cold and a lot of leaves but it was a bit windy . I did like that the restrooms in the pool area were kept very clean . Will definitely go back to the Mirage
30,Decor inside the hotel was beautiful. The food was just mediocre. Hotel room had dust everywhere hair in bathtub bathtub was leaking. Shower door doesn't shut all the way so water was leaking all over the floor. Expensive price for a very average hotel room. Housekeeping was extremely friendly though.
50,We took this mini vacation a bit terrified with the whole pandemic around. When we arrived to front desk it was so clean and the protocols for safety were executed. Of course my son when checking in was very excited to see the fish . The staff during our stay were attentive and friendly. My sons first time in vegas was one to always remember . Thankyou for our comfortable clean friendly stay.
20,Overall the resort is fine but no longer an above average experience. The rooms need to be renovated (I would bet the resort is sold before that happens) and the staff were ok but not the best. We understand with the pandemic things are transitioning but you would think they would be excited to have guests and welcome us. We left thinking that we would have been better off staying at a Hampton Inn and gambling elsewhere...
30,I usually stay at Mandalay Bay so that is what I am comparing to. Dated and when I came here in the 90's it was cutting edge. It is still very 90's. Good location and Venetian is across the street for a higher end experience.
50,Did the check in via the app so we skipped the line. Room was nice. Wish there were more breakfast options. Food was good for the ones that were open. We really enjoyed our time and stay there. Would def stay there again
50,We attended a wedding and it was perfect! The service and food at the reception were exceptional. The reception room was perfect with a fabulous view. Service throughout the weekend was outstanding. Thanks to the Mirage for an unforgettable weekend.
10,Check in was very simplestraight from my phone no wait in line. When I came up to the room there was a strong smell of smoke in the room. And the AC had mold as well as a part the ceiling I don't think that is healthy. Housekeeping is the only thing that kept the stay good other then that the rooms are in terrible shape and unhealthy with mold
50,"This was our first time staying at the Mirage. Over the past 10 years we had been staying at the Flamingo. Unfortunately their customer service and uncleanliness forced us to find another ""home"". They also eliminated most of the chairs at the pool unless you wanted to pay for them even if you stood in line an hour before the pool opened. Also the security team at the Flamingo while entering the pool made you feel like a criminal. I was so impressed with the Mirage. Starting with the front desk they were so helpful and kind. Our room was clean and the casino was clean and you didn't smell the smoke and such as some of the other casinos. The pool was amazing and it was nice to have a chair to relax on without being charged for it. We will definitely be going back in September. So glad we found a new ""home""."
50,Staff was great my first room wasnt what i really wanted went back down offered an upgrade which was great one bedroom penthouse very spacious and nice. I will be returning for a future stay real soon
50,Sports book service was great great food at Snacks and Still Crafts and Drafts easy check in with MLife app friendly staff good water pressure in the shower windows open mountain view 16th floor.
50,I have so many great things to say about this hotel. I’ll keep it short. Clean rooms easy access to the strip staff was so nice. Every house cleaning staff member would greet us. Easy check in and check out.  Beautiful volcano show outside our room window. 10/10 would stay here again.
50,Clean!!!!! Plenty of amenities location is great in walking distance to plenty of activities. Would wish they’d advertise more food & have more late night options but other then that from the gambling to the stay I had a wonderful time with my family!
20,During covid they forgot to clean the bathroom dirty towels under sink clogged toilet and visible dirt in bathtub...ac didnt work in room either only the fan  Told front desk they took resort fees off gee thanks and took 5 hours to come clean the bathroom and 7 hrs to fix toilet
50,Stayed at the Mirage for a slot tournament this weekend. We've stayed in most of the properties up and down the strip and hands down the staff and support at the Mirage were outstanding. This experience will actually pull us away from the venetian and the bellagio just because the staff was so great    Only thing I'd say at all is be aware if your room faces the strip the volcano is loud and the cars racing up and down all night gets a bit old
50,Cleanliness throughout the casino. First time staying at the Mirage and it was nice.  Rooms are clean and service was great.  Waterfalls throughout and nice atmosphere. Also next to forum shops at Ceasars Palace just a few steps away.
50,Great time and experience with staff. Hotel and casino were clean and well taken care of. Other than figuring out that air in the room all was good.  Need more waitresses in casino floor but other than that will be back again.
50,Having stayed at the Mirage numerous times in the last twenty years I find it one of the greatest facilities in town. I have stayed at other properties while traveling to Vegas for Business and vacations but have never been more appreciative of the service provided here.
50,Very friendly accommodating staff.. mid strip.. in the middle of all of the action. Second trip to this hotel will be even better when Vegas is at 100% open. Nice pool good food. Beatles cirque show a must see when reopened.
20,Stayed at this hotel in April/2021 and let me just say that you can do WAY better for the same price or paying slightly more to actually stay in a nice 4* hotel (and this isn’t a 4* anywhere in the world).    The room is really dated and was dirty with rests of food around with the carpet also clearly not clean. The bathtub was completely clogged and there was some hair in it which means it hadn’t been cleaned properly. The minibar did not open at all and seemed broken. The bed was not comfortable not firm at all. All of this for $300/USD night!    Next time I’m paying an extra $40 and staying at the Wynn which is a real hotel not this. 100% NEVER coming back.
30,Rooms need some updates. Bathrooms are very small. The Casino floor smells amazing. Great location on the Strip close to tons of shops and things to do. Volcano feature out front is neat. Pool is nice size and wonderful.
50,Can walk to all of the cool spots... pool is nice and they serve good breakfast at the restaurant. This place needs a food court ... so you have more variety still a great place to stay we love staying here
50,Very nice property and a great location. Had an issue with the safe in the room......some communication errors but got to the root of Th issue and resolved it quickly to my satisfaction....it’s so nice when you don’t have talk to mgmt. and the front desk resolved it!!!!
40,I've reviewed the Mirage in the past. It's been many moons since our last stay. This trip was all about our granddaughter and I thought this would be the best location for her first trip to Las Vegas. Close to the mall and walking distance to Circus Circus.    Check-In:  The system encourages you to check in remotely which we did. However we ended up going to the front desk to have old school key cards for use. This was no problem and the staff were friendly.    I booked a one bedroom tower suite for our stay. I was a little concerned as the room description states that it sleeps four and yet it has one king bed and no pull out couch. However the couch is a rather large sectional and my 14 year old granddaughter slept fine.    The room was amazing. It had a wet bar area; a dining area with a table to seat four a ginormous bathroom and a comfortable king bed. The bathroom feathered an awesome jetted tub separate shower a huge two sink counter area a separate vanity area separate water closet that also had a bidet AND a walk-in closet. The room was absolutely gorgeous!    My only complaints:  There are no microwaves available to add to the room. No coffee makers in the room and its quite a hike to get to starbucks or the snack cafe to get a cup of coffee.    The plugs usb plugs etc are only on one side of the bed. In this day especially in a king room easy access to outlets should be available on both sides.    The only design flaw that I wish were different is access to the bathroom. Again remember that this room accommodates up to four. The only door to the bathroom is in the bedroom. For a room that's over 1200 sq ft I think there should be another entry into the bathroom area outside of the bedroom.    At approximately 2:00 a.m. one morning there was an alarm that sounded. It was truly frightening. It was difficult getting back to sleep. In these days it could be anything from a fire to an active shooting situation. Scary.    Other than these minor inconveniences we absolutely enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend The Mirage to others.
30,$42 per night sounds great. But add resort fee and you can find better value in LV. The hotel is clean and the rooms excellent. But they are out for your money by offering $18 bottles of Fuji water and no way for you to refrigerate your own water. Coffee to your room is $25 and you are forced to buy a giant box of coffee 32oz. Also no honor bar prices are posted and the Essentials store is also a massive rip off. The Still is a good restaurant. I used to love the Mirage but I will not be staying there again as they do not care about customers. Plenty of better value to be found in LV.
10,The worst experience ever at this hotel. We have stayed numerous times pre-Covid and have never been so dissatisfied with a hotel. The amenities were sub par. Having stayed at the Aria a few months prior I expected some accommodations because of Covid but not a skeleton hotel barely operating. The Aria far surpassed my expectations and I wasn’t that fond of it.    To top it off I left medications that were a controlled substance(my fault) that should have been turned in to lost and found. Shocker.......they were not. I will never stay there again. The quality the class I expected was lacking.
20,Clogged shower no water pressure (extremely worse than others) outlets didn’t work walls very thin and so noisy. I could have made any of these work but for this price I shouldn’t have to make so many sacrifices.
20,The hotel is very old and feels like it is on it's last leg. The mattress in my room was hard and very uncomfortable. The casino was dead and no one was winning. I don't have any reason to stay here again.
40,Was a great trip overall. Had some difficulty with using phone digital key card in elevators. Rooms only felt truly cool around 2 am so that was a bit uncomfortable. No info in the room like amenities site map how to order room service pool and cabanas etc. no fridge here fir private use nor at the other MGM’s I’ve stayed at. Only weighted fridge and snack tray to sell you items.
30,Do not put a coffee pot in the room and make me pay $10 for .20 of coffee! Coffee downstairs was $9 - REDICULOUS!! Rooms were OK - beds were comfortable. Pool was great as always! $44 is TOO much for resort fee! 4 People 4 towels 1 shampoo!
40,Have stayed at the mirage multiple times great value and great location. My only issue was on getting a rollaway bed up to the room is was $40 additional per night and the bed was not brought up until we asked for it a 2nd time at 4:30 am and then promptly taken back at 9 am
10,Upon check in there were dirty bandaids in the bathroom. The curtains were ripped and it was generally not clean. Dining was outrageously expensive (150 for pancakes bacon and eggs for a family of 4).
40,Went on a weekend trip with some friends. Had a great stay especially for a few comp nights. Got a $10 per night upgrade to the 24th floor. Only real complaints were the elevators and A/C. To start the elevators were making weird noises getting stuck and pretty slow at times. And that goes for all the floors as me and my friends were spread out between floors/elevators. Hallways and rooms were nice but definitely seemed a little old (not sure when the last remodel was). Only other complaint was the in room A/Cc’s lowest setting being 65° and the room never felt like it got below 70. But with all that in mind those are minor inconveniences and I still enjoyed my stay. Solid 8/10
10,I’m still not satisfied because of Lolli or Lori; Philippine female black jack dealer. She said” Why you come here. You so unlucky” four times. She was telling her Philippine male customer when to hit it not hit the cards. She was flirting and totally ignore me and other Caucasian male customer. This is racist and double standard treatments. She is pretty much stealing money from casino. This is theft. My whole family and fiancé families had been going to Mirage since they first open.
50,The smell when you walk in is truly fantastic and takes you away to paradise! The volcano view king was a fantastic room with plenty of amenities. All the staff we encountered on the trip were friendly and helpful and the ease of mobile check in and check out was fantastic. By far our best and most favorite Vegas hotel experience thus far!
30,Furniture shows wear and tub drain had rust stains around it. Still a nice hotel with excellent staff. Good a great rate because of Covid-19. Several hotel restaurants were closed. Disappointed that California Pizza wasn't open. No reason given.
30,Very beautiful hotel.We gambled in the Mirage casino and became frustrated routinely trying to locate a beverage server. This was not good considering the amount of money my husband and I were spending there. Employees did their jobs (except the casino drink servers) but did not strive to make you glad that you chose the Mirage for your vacation.
50,Perfectly manicured landscaping very hospitable staff excellent gaming atmosphere excellent restaurants very clean room fantastic pool layout and landscape. We are very frequent Vegas visitors and we have never stayed at the Mirage until this visit. All I can say is we have been missing out and we cannot wait to go back to the Mirage.
20,The rooms were ok. Window was broken. The smell of marijuana was horrible. The loud neighbors and people in the hall felt like they were in our room screaming and yelling and playing loud music. Long waits everywhere. Some of the customer service was not good. Rude. Not happy with our stay.
50,Mirage continues to excel in all areas of hospitality. have never encountered rude or incompetent staff in all my years staying there several times yearly. Staff is best on the strip in all facets of hospitality. Restaurant selection admittedly fewer than most large Casinos still offers some of the best food and dining experience on the strip
10,We stayed here as a parent getaway. Unfortunately the ice machine was broken on our floor so we had to get a key for the above floor just for ice. The safe deposit box was broken. And we felt bullied against craps table dealers which made it uncomfortable to play (that’s a separate story) we will not be staying here again
40,I spent a night here with my family. The self parking was very convenient to the registration area and the staff was helpful in getting me a room that suited my needs. The walk from the check-in to the guest elevators required a trek through the entire casino which was quite crowded. Security made sure that masks were worn by guests. The room itself was clean and quiet. The beds were very firm which might be uncomfortable for some.
40,Overall stay at the Mirage was a good experience. The staff was polite and friendly. The biggest thing really was the cleanliness of the room it was dusty and the chair was not all that clean. But all in all I enjoyed the stay at the Mirage.
30,We could not get a server to get us a drink at either the card tables or slots. The room was dated and the refrigerator did not stay cold the AC was loud. The toilet and sink were clogged when we arrived.
50,Mirage is one of my favorite hotels to stay in Las Vegas. Great location nice size rooms and beautiful property. I love the smell of the casino and lobby. The beautiful fish tanks waterfalls and landscaping give a relaxing and calm atmosphere. The pool is one of the best in my opinion. I would recommend this hotel because it's in a great location and has friendly staff.
10,I guess you get what you pay for. Spend a little more and try and get an upgrade or stay elsewhere. Dirty small long walk down long hallways disguised with the trash outside the window. Just try another place of your on a budget.
20,Stayed at the Mirage a few times in the past because they had good food and nice beds. The beds have all been replaced with stock MGM beds which aren't very good and the food choices have gone down. Hard to eat breakfast for under $60.00 for two people.
40,The stay at this hotel is worth it very clean amazing bed. The staff were great including the blackjack dealers and bar personnel. It was unfortunate the restaurants were closed but that was due to the pandemic.
20,I brought my mom for her BD and the only good thing was e machines. The rooms were outdated bathtub appeared dirty but when we cleaned it realized it was rust ( I took pictures) no fridge coffee maker or microwave and I chose room with a view and I got a view of the roof. When the The toilet flushes the sink gurgles. Very disappointed
50,We love the Mirage. Love the layout of the hotel convenience of the rooms to restaurants and the casino. We were on the 24th floor great room excellent view of the strip. The changes made necessary by COVID were manageable.
30,You get what you pay for! We definitely won’t be back. The resort itself is nice but the rooms leave a lot to be desired. All the restaurants are not currently open and/or reservations are not available.
40,The room is clean. The bed was comfortable. My issue was the eateries did not stay open late and they close too early. Which made me have to go outside of the hotel. The distance it took me to get from the check in to the room was a nice walk a little too far.
50,My wife and I went looking for some sun and warm weather. We found it at the Mirage. Great staff great pool and great restaurants (most of which were open!). We have both been vax-ed and felt like we needed to get away. This trip filled the bill.
50,We spent 5 days there and had a great time. Spent a lot of time playing blackjack at the bar and the bartender was really friendly and kept the drinks flowing. Also the pool is awesome. Drinks there might be a little pricey though.
20,Stayed here for 4 nights. The only reason I gave 2 is that the employees were awesome. Upon checkin there was a strong musty mold smell in the room. It effected my wife greatly with her sinuses. Had to make a visit to Walgreens. I asked to move the second night and they were very helpful even though I had to pay and upgrade fee for the same exact room but better view. This room was worse! Wife was pretty much miserable the whole time. Third night I ask to change again. This time I asked him to come to the room with me so I don’t unnecessarily change. This room was nice and clean with no smell at all. Finally got a good night sleep for the last 2 nights. The hotel itself is very nice and 2 nights were great. Can’t. Say enough about how nice the employees were . Unfortunately half the trip was wasted. Please check your room before you move in.
40,Our room was extremely nice and plenty of room bed was comfortable and there were plenty of food snack and drink options throughout the casino. I really liked the convenience of having a little store with alcohol bottles you could purchase.
10,Really over priced and terrible service offered particularly in the casino area and restaurants I tried 3 different places in one night for food and they all had bad food and one forgot my order after I waited 30 min.
30,Would have loved to feel like my trip mattered to the host. Could have stayed anywhere but chose this hotel and didn’t receive great hospitality nor did they do what they said they would do to make up for the error.
10,I was charge for a front desk call as a long distance call 24 books. I also ate there and my stomach was tore up and my husband I go to stairs and buy $25 Imodium because that was the cheapest they sold. So the last day I got double charges that I had the whole time in there!!!
40,pretty disappointed in the fact that all the great restaurants were closed while there. while i understand that Vegas is only operating at 50% it was disappointing that we had to leave the resort for food. only 3 were open and one was just the pantry which was basically sandwiches. Also on the big sign entering the resort was advertising Chin Lin yet he was not there. that is the sole reason we picked the Mirage.
30,The floors were dirty the shower is rusty and the snack area wasn’t filled. We didn’t bother calling the hotel due to us being busy trying to get married. I had given hotel room number to hair and makeup.
50,First time staying here at the mirage and wow let me tell you being a knife reward member I’m pretty positive I got a great deal on a nice penthouse suite ..I also had booked a 2 queen volcano view room for a guest and last min decided to book a standard 2 queen for more company and automatically without asking the friendly staff decided to complimentary upgrade that room to a volcano room keeping both my guest close together and that itself made the trip.. the location is a big plus right smack center of the strip were it’s all at ..and 5 star cleanliness for sure a overall nice hotel to book your future Vegas getaway that I approve of being family friendly ...thanks for the awesome experience hope to see you guys soon!!! 😎
40,All in all it was a nice stay a few problems with other floor occupants. Rooms were clean would like to have had coffee available in the room and a place to put cold drinks/snacks in room. Nice location.
40,Very nice resort the pool area was nice  The rooms are showing some definite wear. We had stains on one of the chairs the desk had a chunk of it missing and the wood around the bottom of the bed and other furniture touching the floor had heavy wear. Make sure to stop for drinks and snacks or expect to pay five dollars for a 20 oz bottle of soda
10,Terrible Room and Halls Were Filled With Marijuana. We asked for a nice room with a view and our room was very dated with dirty furniture window sill and carpet. We will not be returning. Disappointed overall in the stay.
40,It was great over all. Only thing I would say if renting something at the pool watch weather and wind got kicked out for wind but they made it up after we complained not before and we spent 220 on daybeds.but over all good we would go back.
40,The property is very clean however the suite I was in was outdated and did not match the online photos. Very friendly and helpful front desk staff. I recommend checking in online the front desk lines can be long.
40,Great location helpful staff. Beautiful resort. Stay well  Rooms need a deep  Cleaning and hopefully renovations. Room  Service should be 24 hours. Pool menu needs a revamp. More dairy free options. Love that we never felt uncomfortable with our kids. I’ve stayed 3x in 3 months. They take pretty good care of customers. Looking forward to returning once they are more back on their feet post covid.
40,My overall experience at the hotel was good. I did have some concerns on their cleaning since we did find splattered dry fluids across the room. Room service was polite and fast food was good as well. Mobile check in and out was a breeze. Over all it was a good stay. Till next time Vegas !
50,Have stayed at Mirage a few times. Always a great experience. Easy check in and out. Staff always friendly and helpful. The rooms spacious and very clean. Wish had more options for restaurants or room service.
30,I'm been going to Vegas 1-3 times a year since 1987 staying at a variety of hotels mostly on the strip. The Mirage has changed but not for the better. The good - the pool is still very good. The Heritage Steakhouse is good slot selection okay hard to complain when the rooms are comped a restaurant meal comped and some gambling money is provided but.... The no so good - the rooms need a major update. worn carpeting damaged furniture floors cracked. What's worse is housekeeping. I'm not really that picky but they could do a MUCH better job cleaning the rooms. Why do we have to wipe down everything get rid of the previous tenants hair in the tub etc? The tub would fill up with water before my wife cleaned the drain full of hair. Hard to get a drink but the place was packed. Difficult to find an open BJ table. Three permitted at a table with $25 minimum on a weekend night. Hotel is in a great location lobby looks good easy check in. Some of the Caesars properties have updated their rooms but the Mirage is stuck in the 1990's.
20,I get that the mirage is not brand new it’s been around for years. But when you spend 500 a night on a suite you should be able to expect the room to be in good repair. The carpet was not only worn but bubbling up in places every price for furniture was scratched up the wallpaper in the bathroom was coming off the walll not to mention the sink vanities have been painted over white multiple times and still worn. When I asked the front desk if they had another suite that was in better repair that I could stay in (mind you I’ve been here in a normal room and while not perfect it was Decent). I was told that nothing was available yet when I looked on their website they had the same room available to purchase for the days I was staying. That was frustrating. Everything about the casino itself was OK the room not so much
20,No restaurant options. Rooms dirty. Poor gambling options rude dealer. Very disappointed! I will not be retuning nor will I recommend to friends or family. Also very unhappy with being charged $250 for 2 seats at the pool. Such a rip off!!!!
30,House keepers talking and laughing loud slapping doors early at 7am  Other than that everything was great 👍  Hotel is in a great area for family or business. Good restaurants inside the hotel everything nearby
20,This place is mediocre at best. Rooms ok bed was old and uncomfortable. The safe did not work the mini bar was locked and they closed the pool due to wind. Not well managed and would not recommend. Next time we will pay a little more for a better quality hotel.
50,My wife and I really enjoyed ourselves! Very nice establishment nice pool nice dolphins and lions everything was spectacular. Conveniently located in the heart of Vegas. We we are looking forward to our next trip here. At the same place
50,We came here for a family vacation and hope to spend our future vacations staying at the Mirage! If you’re looking for a family friendly hotel on the strip this is it! The mobile check in and out option makes the trip that much more easier highly recommend if you want to skip the lines!
10,Staff did not care that there was a problem. Our room never cooled below 73°. The hallway was cooler then our room was! Trip was so bad we did not even stay more then 24 hours on the property we checked out and left Vegas.    The room was VERY clean however. That was the only upside to our anniversary trip.
40,Clean and attractive. Staff was nice and the area was in a good location. Everything we wanted to do was around the mirage. Hope mask mandate passes next time we come down there. We will be staying at the mirage again
40,Great staff check in and check out processes good adjacent Dolphin park and Big Cat habitat excellent. Clean common areas restaurants and room. Not all restaurants were reopened so long wait at prime meal times
40,Our travel club agent booked the Mirage for us. It fit all our check marks- rate bed size and location on the strip. You can check in and out with the MGM app. Very convenient. We were traveling with friends and they were able to accommodate placing us in rooms close to each other. The volcano show at night was fun and lasted less than 10 min. The hotel location is great for walking the strip. Our room was clean and the bed was comfy. My only complaint was there were not many options for breakfast on site. We wound up going across the street to eat. I think they could publicize their eating establishments more adequately
50,Love the room comfy beds the lobby is magnificent. mobile check in makes everything better and fast love. the casino is amazing nice selection of restaurants. In the middle of slot of action also. Bathroom is amazing
20,Ambiance was amazing. Room 23044 did not work out for me which I was moved to due to the toilet breaking in my room. This was the last room on the floor freezing cold and had a horrible smell. I expected better from a MGM Resort.
50,For the cost charged it's nearly impossible to outdo The Mirage on the Strip. It's a nice balance of enough space and enough people to make it both intimate and a party. And the pool really is one of the best on The Strip as well.
10,Staff were great food options & room amenities were second rate. This is a colossal management failure. One option for breakfast before 10:00 am 45min wait ridiculous.  Starbucks a mile away from the elevators with TWO small chairs NO other place to sit but plenty of hall space to put a lot of tables & chairs. Smart right? apparently not at the Mirage.  Can't use the room refrigerator or pay a $50.00 restock fee if you do who are you kidding.  This is my 4th stay at an MGM property and this was the worst run hotel I've see in decades.
40,Good stay but not my best experience in Vegas. Noisy rooms that were dirtier than expected for this day and age. Mold around the showers. Good location with lots of shopping and restaurant in the vicinity. Lack of good food options but several places seemed to be shut down still thanks to COVID. Would stay again but with more consideration to room location and a progressive move forward towards cleanliness.
40,It's a nice place. Mobile Check-In is the Bees Knees. The Resort and Parking Fees suck! Got room comped through MyVegas just paid Resort Fee. Wouldn't have stayed otherwise. Didn't really interact with any staff.
50,Stayed in room 17091 April 2021. Downloaded the app but had problem with Bluetooth connection so front desk per (really helpful) got me regular key to room. I was surprised how big the room was with desk and chairs mini-couch and view of pool. Bathroom was smaller but modern and functional. Slept great on good mattress and very nice sheets. A/C worked really well. Deuce bus is a great way to travel up and down the strip. Very pleasant stay.
40,We enjoyed our stay. The gambling areas were clean. The slots paid out..Plus the bars are relaxing. Very jubilant hotel & casino.. ! Restaurants get booked so reserve early. Looked very clean and large menus. I are definitely returning soon. Plus we can’t good comps!!
40,3rd time staying at Mirage and once again it was a great stay and great value. Classic Vegas hotel with very nice atmosphere. Not trashy like some locations nearby. Easy walking to lots of great attractions.
30,This used to be one of favorite Hotels. First let me say the Front Desk and housekeeping was great. The room was clean. It was the atmosphere hallways and casino smells like pot. And for some reason the it seems like a 3 star hotel. 3 days of gambling only saw the cocktail waitresses twice and they seem overwhelmed and just not nice. Very hard to explain the whole picture and really felt unsafe.
30,You sold out every room knowing there was a lack of staff servers and restaurants to accommodate your in house guests. More Resturant are need to reduce wait times for service minimum wait for coffee each morning was 40 minutes... ridiculous.
50,As always we enjoy and are pleased with our visit to the Mirage. Your staff is impeccable. Nothing is missed by the staff. Rooms are clean welcoming and comfortable.  The casino was different but that is not a bad thing. Seeing the change due to COVID was a shock. I felt safe and comfortable while playing slots and even while sitting at a card table. My hat is off to the staff for what they have endured during this time in our lives. Thank you for another wonderful stay.
50,Everything about the hotel the room and the service was very good. We enjoyed this property very much. The machines here seemed much tighter then in the past but maybe it was just bad luck. We'll be happy to give this hotel another try.
50,If you want to experience a great time in a fantastic room with everything there is to offer at your fingertips book a room at The Mirage!!! You will not be disappointed. We can't wait to go back. Make sure to bring your swimsuit because the pool area can't be beat!
10,Called and requested housekeeping to service and change the linens. The room was serviced but the linens weren’t changed. My sons bloody nose stains was still on the sheets when we returned to our room at 11:30pm. The bathroom also had a mildew smell that lingered throughout the room.
30,6am our phone rang when I got to the phone they hung up. Then at 9am the fire alarm and announcement went off and continued to repeat for 5min then at 9:30am housekeeping knocked to clean our room even though it was our last day and checking out at 11.
30,This was a basic hotel. Nothing positive stuck out however a few negatives did. The wifi was non existent. I had to turn my wifi off to actually connect to anything. There was no refrigerator in the room which ends up being a pain for leftovers or any cold drinks. I saw many people dragging coolers thru the hotel. It was ridiculously hard to eat at this hotel. All restaurants were by reservation only and always booked out. The line at the snack bar was consistently a 30 min wait. Room services ended at 3pm! Our room was a little dirty as well. Our window had brown drips and smears all over it hair everywhere and the carpet stunk like feet. The AC didnt work at all. The hallway was cooler then our room.    I wouldn't stay here again.
10,When I first stayed at this hotel in 1990 it was a pioneering trailblazer. That spirit seems to have died long ago. I have been traveling extensively recently and I was very disappointed that we were not able to get any food or coffee not late at night nor in the morning. Most of the restaurants were closed and many of the attractions were suspended. No coffee makers were in the room and room service is advertised as 24 hours per day but when I called after 11:00 pm or at 6:00 am I got a recording stating they were closed and reopen at 7:00 am. When I called at 7:00 am I was put on hold for at least 10 minutes at which point I hung up and had to venture out to get coffee. This hotel seems to have lost its way and its identity. With all the other possible hotels to stay at I will pass this one by in the future.
10,My 3 night stay housekeeping never came. pool staff was rude. When asked for room service she came in dropped towel and got on phone and left no cleanliness what so ever really upset on my stay I ask for a late check out and was given a hour
40,Everything was great including the service! Variety of great restaurants beautiful tropical pool great music throughout the property. Only thing that could be added is a litmore shopping and some slight room updates.
40,Had problems but they haven’t reach out for resolving yet. A lot of in wanted charges made on my credit card throughout the stay. I’ve reached out 3 different times but no resolution. Overall good resort tho
50,The Hotel is so clean and the rooms service from the pantry is amazing as well as the food!! I always try to stay here when we come to las vegas especially with my 95 year old grandmother.. she loved the hotel and the food. we did not ask for a handicap room but everything was so spacious!
50,The wife and I had an amazing 4 night stay in the one bedroom tower suite vivid rules in place and this was a delightful return to semi normalcy. The staff was great in fixing a couple problems and we walked away winners.
40,Checked into a standard resort king room on a Thursday. Only 1 person ahead of us in the check in line. Room was very clean and had everything we needed. Best part of the trip was the pool. We rented a cabana for the day and had the best time. Our cabana host Danielle was AMAZING. Spent a lot of time gambling here as well. $10 tables seem to be a thing of the past on the strip but they did have a decent amount of $15 tables so that was at least good. Didn't win much but who does in Vegas? Overall a very good trip. Only reason for 4 stars is those are for properties that blow me out of the water and this one just didn't. A very nice stay though.
20,Dirty socks were found in our room upon check in and several expensive clothing item missing upon check out. The hotel staff was non existent doing everything digitally. Even when assistance was needed I had to call and wait on hold for over 10 minutes.
20,Reservation made for Anniversary months in advance was not honored all king beds were sold out (sorry) you can move room tomorrow and have the room you reserved!! Room safe didn't work did move rooms next day much nicer room but mini bar locked we wanted to spend our $50 resort credit with a couple of drinks. Tried to use the resort credit at bar but the bartender had already rung it a different way.
30,While the hotel is all glitz and glamor there’s no feeling of luxury if the staff is not up to par. Maybe it was better service pre-COVID but the check-in line was like waiting for Six Flags—very long and wrapped around the ropes.    Same issue with check out. The automated key drop station wouldn’t pull up our reservation and directed us to the front desk but the line was moving so slowly we would have missed our Lyft had we waited for assistance. Nothing you want to encounter during a long day of traveling.    It’s a really big hotel and can be a little confusing (especially with all the slot machines everywhere in the lobby). It was hard to find help and when I finally found someone that worked at one of the hotel restaurants she completely walked away from me mid-question.    Overall the energy was weird. None of the staff seemed happy to be there or assist you. Besides that woman I encountered they are polite enough. I wouldn’t mind giving it another chance once it has some life to it. But there are so many other hotels on the strip that I’ll be trying next.
20,Check in was fabulous our room was ready  view of volcano awesome! Room was sooooooooooo dirty called front desk was placed in new room immediately room had an empty pringles can in closet and dirty mirrors we can handle that looking back we should of got a discount or upgraded. We do not like to complain.
10,I feel that this was my biggest financial loss of the weekend. What a waste. Would have been better off in a super 8. Complaining did nothing to help. Room was exceptionally hot AC was awful. It was colder outside and in the hotel hallways. Bed was like sleeping on straw. Shower was like someone put a bottle full of holes on the faucet. Walls were paper thin people yelling ALL night long neighbors reported happened again the next night. All around my worst Vegas experience. Wish someone would have taken my reviews through Expedia seriously and given me a legitimate option for compensation. Won’t spend a dime in The Mirage ever again.
50,We were treated very well. Pool is awesome. Rooms are very clean. Casino is not real Smokey. Location is wonderful and we got to ride the tram over to Treasure Island. The volcano show was beautiful. Checkin was very easy and staff was very helpful.
50,We decides last minute to go to Las Vegas to escape the snow and cold. The Mirage was a great value and was able to get us rooms last minute. We rented a cabana 2 days an they were clean and well stocked with drinks and snacks. The cabana attendants were friendly and attentive.
20,I know Covid limits staff and maintenance but it really put a damper on the overall experience of feeling like we were on vacation. And seeing people being escorted out by police was kind of scary. Smelt like a drug bust.
10,Stepped on a piece of glass and cut my foot when exiting the shower several lights didnt work in my room. Overall very disappointed. Only one room key worked and I didnt care to stand in line to get another one.
20,Resort fee was supposed to cover Wi-Fi pool etc. Wi-Fi was bad the pool was so ice cold you couldn’t get in it. Rooms were outdated and dirty. No coffee maker in the room and no way to refrigerated anything you didn’t want to pay $$$$
20,Mentioned on my reservation that It was my bday and I would appreciate a room with a good view. Was told when I got there for $10 i could get that. After the bill was tallied was told $10 per night. $30 total. You would think they could comp that for your 53rd bday. Then they charged me an additional $90 for 2 bottles of water from the mini bar. No fridge in the room and the ac kept shutting off before the temp was reached. Hot in the room. Very disappointing.
10,The rooms at the Mirage were so incredibly outdated. The bathroom was small. The tub was smaller. The rooms were dirty and had holes in the headboards. Asked for a fridge that was never delivered too. I’ve stayed at lesser known hotels in better shape than this.
30,As someone who's stayed at this property tens of times I can honestly say the rooms are becoming extremely dated and dirty and the lack of communication regarding new protocol at the Private Oasis pool is awful.
30,We were celebrating a birthday and took advantage of great rates at the hotel. It was at a cost though because we did not feel as safe as we normally do with screaming on our hotel floor both nights at 4am and just the crowd in general was rougher. Safety is always a concern for wherever travel leads you today and will defintely look at a different hotel on a return trip to Vegas. Also with the virus concerns you should not have to worry about sitting down on a chair in your hotel room that is visibly soiled. Either remove it completely or add one that can be wiped down. Rooms need more attention.
50,We always have a fantastic time while staying at The Mirage. The rooms are spacious and the beds always comfortable. The housekeeping staff is always friendly and attentive. The selection of different restaurants to choose from is great!
20,For the past 4 years I've stayed at this hotel 5 times & noticed how the hotel has gotten worse. Staff isn't as good as they used to be. Will be staying else where for future stays in Vegas because it isn't worth what I paid
50,Brought some relatives and friends here. The location was perfect and the rooms were clean and very nice. The casino was not too smoky which we all appreciated and we ended every evening at the bar nearby where the server remembered our drinks from the previous night.
30,Hotel nice clean. Bathrooms small outdated Nice pool at least didnt have to wait forever to get into it. Good location Easy in and out hotel Gambling machines like rest of machines tightened up all over Vegas except downtown.Trying to make up for covid losses all at once
30,No coffee available until 6:00 am sit-down breakfast only available at 7:00 am. For a Midwest resident whose body was still on CDT that was a bit of a wait. Too many people walking around the casino with no masks or their noses uncovered. Stopped at “Snacks” for an evening coffee. While standing in line to place my order I witnessed a kitchen worker making sandwiches with his mask dangling below his chin. I reported this to the shift manager who was apologetic and promised to address this issue. However I was in line for about 7 minutes. I clearly could not be the only person to watch this guy make sandwiches without a mask.    We made a reservation with a $50/night stay food and beverage credit. There was information online that the credit was not available on the day of check-in. Our second day’s credit almost covered breakfast at The Pantry. Our third day’s credit had to be used before we checked out. We had planned to use it at NY NY for lunch before heading to the airport. Alas that was not possible.
50,This was a hotel I have not stayed at in a while. They did a great jib dealers were friendly rooms were clean with a great view. Dinner at the steakhouse was on point too! We also spent some time at the pool. Drinks service was great and beautiful weather helped!
50,We booked a room at the Mirage for the weekend and it was pretty good stay comfortable bed and lots of different restaurants and mobile reservations was cool. Pool was really packed gym was nice and clean and had lots of equipment. Mobile Check in and check out was great and allowed for us to check in before we arrived. Definitely recommend the mirage
50,The amenities offered at the Mirage made our trip enjoyable. Great restaurants like Pantry and Snacks served great meals. Our room was spacious with a great view. Staff was very efficient and check-in went quickly and any of our questions were answered promptly. We will certainly come back to the Mirage.
50,There are a wealth of properties at which we have stayed in Las Vegas. Some are MGM properties and others are not.    Mirage stands head and shoulders above the competition on the strip. Their location is near the center of the strip making it easy for most people to walk to and from other resorts should they choose to do so.    Rooms are immaculately clean. Beds are the most comfortable we have ever encountered in Las Vegas. The pool is easily the best pool on the strip. Their customer service cannot be beat.    The customer service at the Mirage is head and shoulders above other resorts on the strip. They make it a point to ensure every interaction matters and that guests feel welcome during their stay.    When we go to Las Vegas so long as the Mirage has rooms available they are our go to place.
10,I have stayed at the mirage and several other MGM properties over the years but is by far the worst experience I have had.  Security: I was accosted by two homeless persons once while sitting in the outdoor seating area of the Rum bar. The homeless man broke a wine bottle he picked up on the property and came at us with it. Next while sitting at an electronic roulette table a homeless man came a sat next to me an proceeded to put his arm around me and attempted to push buttons on my machine . In both instances the response from security was slow condescending and acted as though this happened all the time. They could not even look me in the eye when I was giving them a description of the assailant.  Cleanliness: our room was filthy the floors were not vacuumed the baseboards on the bed were covered in dust and the ice bucket bag was stuck together with some sort of sticky residue and the towels had hair on them. You could not go anywhere on the casino floor without the reck of pot smoke this is illegal but nothing was done.  The main issues that I encountered was the lack of responsiveness of the security and maintenance team. If they had been have as worried about my personal safety as they were about where my mask was on my face none of this would have happened. I will not be back. For them to say to me that my safety and security was their main priority well they failed me this day.
40,Nice clean hotel. But no coffee maker. No usable fridge it was locked. Vending machine charged me $9 for a $3.50 pop. Be careful sitting on toilet. It’s a child height. I fell not expecting to sit so low. Air condition made loud random low noise. Overall nice hotel.
40,Fridge didn’t work. Attempts were made to fix it but no response after we called a second time. Front desk gave us $100 which was very nice. But then our room was entered while we were out despite our putting our privacy “ do not disturb “ sign o door and red privacy light!
30,Nice somewhat clean rooms. It was enjoyable but not fun. Restaurants were blah. Service was just good enough to get by. Employees seem very unhappy which brought the whole experience down. Casino was not paying at all. Not even allowing you to play. Just take take take so had to stop playing early. This past experience has made me not want to go back. It felt like since it has opened back up  vegas needs to make up for the past year of being closed. Big bummer.
50,Great location. Great price. A bit of work on the rooms would go a long way. Rooms are clean but show their age. Staff was super friendly and helpful. It was nice to see so many people cleaning all hours of the day and night.
40,Before our stay I read reviews and was a little worried based off of all the one star reviews. I was very pleasantly surprised. Our room was clean the pool was wonderful and food at the pantry and by the pool was delicious. Mirage is in a great location as well. A lot of the restaurants were closed and room service was not 24/7 which was the downside for us. In terms of gambling the gambling floor is very small and limited but we aren’t big gamblers so that didn’t bother me. Overall would stay again if the price was right.
30,Nothing special. A clean open room small bathroom comfortable bed functioning TV. There is a minibar but no refrigerator for guests’ use. Parking is free. Need more outlets at the nightstands. Plenty of towels and toiletries. Room service was every day. Employees very friendly and helpful.  Many people in common areas either not wearing masks or wearing them improperly.  We reserved a room with a $50 food and beverage credit for each night we stayed. The first day does not count. We used a credit for breakfast at Pantry. Scrambled eggs ham and toast an omelet and toast and two coffees: $54.19 before tip – an incredibly expensive breakfast in my opinion. We were going to use the remaining $50 food and beverage credit on the day we checked out but were told it is not good after checkout.  No coffee until 6 a.m. No sit-down breakfast until 7a.m.  We did not pay for a view and got what we paid for.
10,Stay away from this horrible hotel. There are much better options. MGM has ruined the service hours rooms (shower was broke fan in bathroom sounded like a 737) and the hotel has become a place for low end trash to stay.
40,Hotel overall is nice just the draining problem with shower and toilet. Didn't complain to the staff and probably should have noted it to staff but overall great location casino was nice and waitresses were very quick with drink orders.
50,the mirage has some of the best views out of the mgm properties. The room was clean and I had a pretty good time while I was there for a couple nights..I would definitely recommend trying this place out if you haven't!
40,Had a lot of fun as a family staying here. Liked that a lot of things were close to walk to. Just wished Mirage had more family friendly restaurants open. Didn’t eat there except once due to limited variety.
50,Wonderful visit still limited by Covid so no shows/buffets but had a great time at Mirage. Located middle of the strip for easy wandering pool side was perfect and restaurants were great food/service to fill the no buffet void. Most importantly very clean and good environment to relax and play...
40,We loved our room and the location of the hotel. Center strip so easy walking in either direction. Got lucky and saw the fountain go off as well. I had someone who had never been there so we put on a lot of miles and it was great. Also were there when parking was free. I can’t believe they charge guests for parking.
30,The pool is nice the lobby is nice but the rooms need attention. New paint cabinets refinished cleaned better!! There was a black hair in my bath tub and a dirty ring around it. Underneath the cabinets lots of dust and confetti from the last party in that room. #2482. Come on Mirage get with the program! And of course no services with Covid.
40,We stated at Mirage in March after rebooking 3 times. This was a very nice trip. The Mirage  was just opening back up Full time so not all the restaurants were open. The ones that were were great. The only downfall was there was an overwhelming smell of marijuana in the hallway to our room. It was so strong. IF this is a non smoking hotel doesn't that still mean marijuana as well. I know that its legal in Nevada but non smoking still mean non smoking doesn't it. Find a spot outside to smoke.Please.
40,It's a very nice hotel but the casino is suffering. Table games were minimal although to be fair these were weeknights. Blackjack opportunities were poor but used to be great. The rooms are large and comfortable. Beds are excellent and a/c is very quiet. Large TV with plenty of channels but I wasn't there to watch TV. Parking is back to free and hopefully will remain that way. If the rate is right it's still a very solid choice.
40,We loved our room and view. The pool was insanely cold and no one could stand it. There also was not enough food options and coffee options. We enjoyed gambling the the dolphin experience very much. The volcano show was the highlight of the trip for my children.
10,Poor air conditioning room was way to hot rooms are basically paper thin not one morning did I sleep well from 5am until 10am loudest hotel I’ve ever stayed at random insane credit card charges from the hotel to my card that staff couldn’t even explain or give a straight answer to and kept dancing around what happened one charge for $806 and another for $665 in the middle of the night I feel very uncomfortable at this hotel and come to Vegas every few months and thought it would be a nice change from Excalibur and boy was I wrong. Dirty sheets asked for it to be addressed and cleaned by the cleaning staff came back to a bed made with the same sheets. Small bathrooms compared to other less nice hotels. Would never stay here again or recommend actually made our trip a headache and less enjoyable than usual. Also if you’re looking for a good meal you won’t find it at this hotel they have two restaurants open that serve such gross food I understand the understaffing and lots of people due to covid but this food was nasty. They also have just a small store for essentials where a Gatorade is $6. I recommend Excalibur highly over this and that’s sad.
50,In the midst of a pandemic our stay at the Mirage was perfect!  The resort was pristine clean. And we can smell the unique cleanliness as soon as you walk in the door.  Food options were great! Restaurant hours perfectly accommodated my late evening cravings!
30,Great location. Everythibg else is a money grab. All food is expensive even the casual places. Restaurants are usually packed and close by 10pm on weekdays. You will wait in line everywhere: check-in elevators mlife cashier restaurants etc.  Room was clean but nothing fancy. The room never seem to get that cool either. Lastly garage is a long walk to the elevators so it's a pain lugging your luggage.
30,Of the 20+ hotels my wife and I have stayed at in the past 15 years in Vegas this was average. Got a good deal on the room so found it to be good value but would have been very disappointed if we had paid full fare. Was very standard room and did not feel that anyone went out of the way to make our trip great. But did not have any real issues also-so as stated run of the mill
50,Las Vegas trip with friends after a year of not being together due to Covid lockdown was exceptional at Mirage. Great customer service friendly environment clean safe. Highly recommend this centrally located property
30,Mirage is in a good location on the strip. Rooms are clean but a little outdated. Staff is friendly Restaurants have good food. Weekend atmosphere is lively. Make sure to make a reservation in advance for restaurants if you want to eat.
40,Overall pretty satisfied with this property its gorgeous and huge. Cabana was kind of expensive compared to others but was still pretty awesome! Wish the property recognized birthdays a little bit more! Perfect location on the strip where all the action is!
10,Can't believe that this once iconic establishment has fallen to this level. It is not worthy of your dollar even with the discounted prices. The crowd that they are drawing does not offset the value they are presenting. I would rather pay more and get the service I would expect from a recognized brand like MGM. We visited other locations that they don't own and had better value for the dollar.
30,The hotel is in the exact spot you wanna be when staying on the strip.... however the bathroom in our room was ridiculously small and very much needing updates to the tub area... lots of rust and found a bunch of long black hairs.. also having to use your key every time just to operate the elevator was a bit extreme
30,Guest room accommodations were not up to par but for a busy and modern hotel everything was certainly livable. Minor issues with lights and draining but great location easy taxi transportation and very nice modern design.
50,I picked this hotel because it was in it center of the strip had good reviews and a great price. It was my first time in Vegas. The mirage didn't disappoint. We were able to check in online. We could use our phone as our room key with the app. We got our room keys printed however.  Our room was clean. Housekeeping did a great job restocking everyday. The pool was beautiful. There is a poolside bar. There is also a self serve water station at the bar for free which was great for staying hydrated.  The tiger lion and dolphin habitat was amazing. We were able to watch them feed and train the dolphins.
10,Too noisy loud hallways and music until 3am no one picks up at the front desk noise continues after noise complaints from other guests I got charged twice and got charged incidentals when nothing was used in the room beware of this hotel!
50,Pool was open only until 5pm. Water was chilly but refreshing on hot days. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean. Easy check in and check out. The Strip view was great. Not a lot of noise. We were on the 23 floor.
10,Our suite was disgusting. Horrible smell broken fridge large paint chips on tub tub stopper not working shower walls and floors heavy mold  wallpaper peeling off walls in  bathroom revealing mold covered walls overall just very dirty and worn room.
20,Loved the property but I could not get a good nights rest in this hotel due to the thin walls; could hear conversations loud and clear throughout the night. If anyone wants to stay here I strongly recommend doing so during the week
30,The Mirage is a very nice place to stay but it is heading down a bit. The clientele seems a bit seedy now and the service in some bars is extremely slow. The Still is great. My TV did not work in my room upon arrival and my mobile check in did not work and then they upsold me upon checkin.
20,Very disappointing. From the ac in the room that didn't work to no service at our paid permits pool seats to rude host staff at restaurants to 3 hour waits unless you had reservations 1 or 2 days in advance. Housekeeping staff was good. Non smoking floor smelled like pot the minute you exited the elevator. Beds super uncomfortable. Asked for matress topper for comfort and front desk acted like they had no clue what I was asking and we never got it. Moved to new room at hotels convenience not ours bc our ac did not work. I could go on
50,We had amazing stay staff was very friendly and very helpful upon arrival! Our room was clean and housekeeping service was great as well! It was all around a great trip we had no complaints! We will definitely stay here again
40,Good location and value..staff handles issues quickly when needed..rooms clean and comfortable..casino nice but lots of machines broken if not shut off due to COVID..restaurant choices limited for now
50,I’m so happy to have chosen the mirage to stay. This was my first visit to this hotel and I’m thrilled I chose this property. Next time I will stay at another property but I really like Mirage.  This was in the perfect location to shop the Forum and Venetian across the street. Loved our stay here. We will be returning soon.
30,"The property and guest rooms look and feel dated and the comfortable and very clean rooms that I once knew have grown old and are just ""ok"" at best. I'm fine with the new and increased prices for ""everything"" as that's expected. However the service cleanliness food beverage and gaming is lacking big-time and being an M Life patron means little to nothing. We were super excited to support this property and team however left with many boxes not checked off."
40,We had an excellent time and enjoyed our stay at the Mirage. The swimming pool was out of this world very relaxing. The resort provides a variety of stores to shop as well as restaurants to eat at.    Awesome family vacation!
40,Located on the strip and walking distance to shops and restaurants. However we didn't need to leave during our two day stay. There were plenty of dining choices within the hotel shopping and of course the pool. Only word of advice? Make dining reservations and get in line early for the pool.
30,The room has has a two much as smell toilet doesn’t flush safe safe box close registration it’s busy only two people VIP service is close in the hallway the wall it was damage A lot of people smoking in the hallway smoking Marijuana every where
30,"Pool was the best part. Casino smelled wonderful . But The mirage rooms need to be updated. Chairs were old wallpaper was peeling off the wall. Curtain had rips in them etc. Room was Simply not worth $500 for 3 nights even with a ""strip view"" which was more of the pool view.. bathroom was extremely small door almost touches the toilet when opened... i guess their ""stay well"" rooms are better but still wouldn't stay here again."
50,I had an amazing stay at The Mirage in the presidential suite. The room far exceeded my expectations. The jet tub was exceptional and I felt comfortable with plenty of room for my entire stay. I will definitely be returning to this suite for future stays in Las Vegas even though I have family I could stay with for free. Thank you!
30,First room water leaked everywhere in our bathroom from the vent causing me to slip but luckily caught myself then was moved to another room were there was barely any air so the room was hot all the time.
40,Clean  pleasant  decent customer service with a great location. Overpriced like all LV hotels with a $49 a night resort fee while due to COVID there were limited services offered and many closed restaurants and shows. Still we had a very nice trip!
40,I booked this trip in February for my birthday two months away. I took my best friend and my brother (who stayed across the street at Flamingo). We spent three nights. The room was adequate. The beds were comfy. The window opened no problem. There are a lot of long mirrrors there so checking my look before hitting the town was great! I came back to the room really late after looking high and low for an open restaurant to no avail. I seen the small can of Pringles on the snack bar. Even though I knew it would cost me I ate them. It cost me $10 according to my hotel receipt. The bathroom is decent size. The housekeeping staff were very nice. I spent the second day of our trip at the pool. No problem getting a lounger chair. The drink in the big Mirage cup was $38.95!! Wow. I sipped on that for a couple of hours. Spent 4.5 hours at the pool. The pool is a lot cooler on the side where the fountain pours into the pool warmer on the opposite side. Lots of restaurant options inside the hotel. The casino is massive. Had a beer at the Center bar $9 for a Stella Artois. Had no problems with theft or getting ripped off in the casino area or on the entire Vegas strip. The solarium is beautiful I'm an admirer of plants and I appreciate things like this. Beautiful water features and artwork throughout the building. There is a tram that runs between Mirage and Treasure Island which was nice if you had to walk to Fashion Show Mall.
40,Very clean staff at the bar and cocktail waitresses were very nice and polite! They would make sure we were taken care of when it came to providing our drinks. Check in was amazing as well. Very nice and provided detailed information regarding our promotion and MLife account.
50,The front desk was very accommodating in getting me the room that I reserved. I had a volcano view room and asked to be on a higher floor and she was able to get me a higher up corner room with views from north east and south! The bed was very comfortable and I had no issues during my weekend visit. Only downside was with the restaurants and the lines but that was mostly due to Covid along with the pool. Loved the Dolphin Show and the Volcano Show. Had dinner one night at Costa and the food was amazing. Definitely recommend making reservations during these times. The hotel went out of its way to make sure you felt comfortable. Thank you for making this a wonderful experience. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.
30,Loved the pool. Room not as clean as what I would Expect especial for the price. Herat location though. Close to everything. Staff was actually amazing and very helpful and friendly.  Well as super friendly.
30,Nice hotel to stay at but don't put a single dollar in any machine! Go across the street to Harrah's where their slots actually know how to payout! MGM resorts DO NOT PAY ANYTHING OUT NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU SPEND OR HOW MUCH YOU'RE ON A MACHINE!!!!
20,Booked a Strip view Penthouse Suite for 2 months in advance and ended up looking at the freeway for 3 nights. Called hotel Manage upon check in and was told they were booked and could not move us. Mirage front desks Manager just acted like sorry we ruined your Birthday trip but nothing we can do.. LAST TRIP to Mirage there are so many more hotels to choose from. Although I love to gamble there... probably won't be back to Mirage.
20,Rooms are outdated price was much higher than the quality of the rooms. I’m upset we didn’t book Flamingo instead (it would have been cheaper too)    The pool is pretty nice and the location is prime.    Otherwise it’s a no from me.
50,It’s a great hotel to stay at when you are in Las Vegas My family enjoyed this place very much !! Staff there were very friendly and helpful. The rooms there are clean and very spacious. Overall the hotel was gorgeous.
10,Service and rooms were very poor. Pool was ice cold. Given a room with a tub that wouldn’t fill due to a faulty drain. Casino dealers were rude a disinterested. Food was barely average. Do not recommend
30,The hotel has gone downhill and is showing it’s age. The overall experience was lacking due to the current clientele and the number of dogs we encountered. Not worth the price anymore especially when there are so many nicer hotels in the MGM group.
30,The casino and restaurants in the Mirage are awesome! Great atmosphere and lots of things to do. The only issue I had was our room. It was 9047 and there was a serious angle to the floor. We believe this caused the door to the minibar to remain slightly open. The minibar leaked and it caused an odor in the room. When I called the front desk the first and second day I was told someone would be sent to fix it. This didn't happen and the carpet was wet from the leak and the odor remained. I called on the last day of our trip and they said we could move rooms. I was very surprised that it took that long to help us and that we were only offered the change of a room.
30,Pros: Great pool fun casino and great value  Cons: The beds were awful adjoining room issues and had to wait in line for over an hour to get a chair at the pool.    I called and booked two adjoining rooms for my family and it was on one reservation. When we arrived the lady told us that adjoining rooms were not guaranteed and we would have separate rooms. How can we have three children stay in a room on a different floor? After speaking to a supervisor we got it straightened out but it took several hours and started off the trip on a bad note. The next issue was the beds. We had two rooms and four beds...and they were hard as a rock! One of our rooms was dirty (seemed old) and the other one was updated. Weird because they were adjoining???    Next big issue was the pool. I got in line at 7:45 am to get chairs for the family. The line was all the way to the casino by 9:00 am. Crazy!    Casino - $15 to $25 tables minimum everywhere. Had a good run at Craps! And roulette. No one was winning on the slots.    Overall it’s a good midrange casino in a good location. It’s definitely not the Wynn and it’s definitely not an old run down off the strip hotel. It’s a middle of the road hotel/casino.
40,"MGM Resort Fans. Loved the location resort layout restaurants 3 pool complex - two 21 n older service tropical layout & theme and the erupting Volcano show out front never disappoints.    Covid-19 practices were on point! Exceptionally clean rooms public areas and masks enforced inside and on property. Housecleaning was excellent we tipped regularly. The Heritage Steak House was a perfect 10 and worthy every penny. Staff friendly and helpful. Loved the cell phone check in/out w virtual keys never waited in line! Great stores Secret Garden w dolphins & tigers and a great vibe!    Upgraded to King Tower room # 24126 and was greatly disappointed. The electrical outlets inop and we use a CPAP bathroom light would short out when in there requiring flashlights standing water in the shower 1"" deep when in use USB ports to charge electronics inop no luggage carts or help after a late arrival and the front desk nor their engineers could affect repairs. The Mirage Corporate did make it right by us after we left and emailed them.    We'll be back but will be hard pressed on checking the room out for functionality before unpacking anything."
10,If you have disabilities (please be aware before you choose to book this Hotel)  Someone with multiple disabilities gets no attention here at the Hotel.  Internet cannot connect phones they won’t answer food service keeps you on Hold.  Wow-Zy what a service?  I’m saddened that I have to leave this review. Maybe your thinking off staying at this Hotel from my experience I can say I won’t be in the future.  From walking in the first day which was last evening. Bellman who asked if I needed help and having 4 bags to be delivered in few hours wasn’t feasible for me. I declined it and they said ok- they all ended up watching the show of someone’s potential arrest who was asked to leave this Hotel. What I couldn’t understand is why would they not help assist a client to take their bags up (which in fact the guy could have received a generous tip) but wasn’t focused. This make the Hotel look bad.  I spoke to a gentleman name Chris who is a security manager that said I’ll have higher management who would reach out to me yet no one called.  This morning I woke up with low-low blood sugar made several attempts to speak to front desk and was son hold forever room service they transferred me but was on hold forever internet didn’t work so I couldn’t get what I wanted as help since Hotel was not able to fulfill.  Does this not make you curious. Left a massage for a manage to call me Witt gratitude they offered $200 of credit but wasn’t able to fill the mission on that I need food right away. Hour later I got a call from Alex (manager) that they aren’t able to bring the food to the room because of Pandemic. They have the medical emergent team Cole snd check Emmy vitals. See they aren’t getting it that I need food as I have no energy. Please help/ they made a way to make emergency tens come up but they won’t bring any food (such as a cereal and a small salad which can get my blood sugar up quickly) with them but they can out me in the chair to take me downstairs.  Is that dumb or what ??  Apparently this Hotel seem not to get the importance and viability of someone with tripe 1 diabetes and sleep apnea. I believe we have a legal issue here as I’m munching on sugar stuff in my room because Hotel doesn’t have Half of the stuff promised for guess to be able to access. It’s a lie. From what they advertises of rooms first and foremost to someone two hours ago trying to connect me to the room service did they not know this wasn’t possible or did they waste my time in need. Then manger calling and dancing with how not to make things happen to help assist a guest but going around to make the time longer to reach a clients goal which could save their lives.  Is this Hotel this weal that even people with disabilities can’t be helped.  To those who may have medical issues you may want to stay way from this place or you can literally loose your life and get 0 help while they believe in following their own idiotic rules snd self agenda. Dumbest Hotel I’ve dealt with. Seriously  This slid clearly a slap in the face to someone who isn’t able to get food but they won’t make an exception or help-  Too much of file like their prideful rules then help someone from passing out.  Do you have a change of heart?? By reading this review me as well.  See the picture below- on food pantry (their own restaurant) does it mention about something not been offered for pandemic off course not it’s only after you check in you have to deal with these lies.  Does the picture show anything mentioning they won’t deliver the food by looking at the 2 pictures which I got it off their own site. When manager called I asked him that question and now the comment turned. That is why I’m calling you that food pantry did not pick up the call when we were trying to reach and we were using the info that was given to us. Now they looked like bafoons with the continued lies that been coming at me. Food pantry calls/ as will THIS TIME HELP YOU OUT I asked for a medium black coffee just to find out they don’t have a single cup but $15 box that services many. So what does a single person do with all that office. If you end up using their refrigerator they actually have a sign that customers will pay $50 one tile fee for using the outside food for storage.  3 hours coming after told twice that someone will come to your room to help fix internet issue and being a refrigerator. So far none has followed up.
10,Property is very very run down. Room was the worst we have every been in. Noise in the room was very very bad. I’ve machine went off all night long and the people there  were making noise up and down the hall.    I can’t even believe we had to pay for this room. If Mirage would consider not charging us for this bad experience we would reconsider our experience.    Otherwise we could not even think about recommending this resort to anyone we know and I travel to Vegas every week on business myself.    Regards  Ken
10,Went to the pool they told us Dana moved to Manhattan in search of Freeman the undefeated / undisputed 1-2 poker champion at The MGM. Freeman was last seen in the park casually jogging in case you needed to ketchup.
20,I don’t know where to begin at I am soooo Disappointed! Me and my friends were sooo excited to be staying at the Mirage for our weekend girls trip to Vegas as soon as we got there we discovered that our room was not cleaned the bar counter tops were filthy and there was dried up food on the safe in the room and there was hair & trash on the bathroom floor we called downstairs and they told us that someone would be right up to clean the room 2 hours later no one had called and we had to call back down stairs and ask to be moved to another room only to have the same problem we mite as well stayed at a Super 8 it probably would have been cleaner there was rust around the tub drain the light switches were filthy u can tell no one has sanitized them (in our original room the light switch was filthy also) and outlet was missing a cover around it and the bed was hard as a brick I will not be staying there again the only good thing was the location.
20,The ac was not working in our room after 2 calls to the front desk and 2 visits from the ac teach it still wasn’t working. They didn’t even offer a room to move to we slept in a very hot room... Please avoid at all cost!
10,My Son and I could not stop sneezing the pillows felt like balls of cotton    Stained like they weren't changed    Broken sink and running toilet    Nasty carpet  Definitely not worth over 100 a night    Equivalent to motel 6.  I pay higher prices for Hotels for the luxury of cleanliness and higher quality this was a waste of money
40,Could have used vacuumed. I found and stepped on plastic pieces from newly purchased clothing. At the end of the bed and on tile. Otherwise we always were taken care of. There is an ice machine which is convenient
50,I stay here all the time and perfect location. Great casino and restaurants. The only negative was it was hard to get a coffee. Only one Starbucks which was crowded and all the other places were closed.
20,Drain clogged tub grossly stained with rust pressure of shower painful as if was being hosed down by a  Pressure washer- complained no fix  Rooms overall were ok bed was comfy atleast. Expensive to stay at for room conditions
40,Love the ability to check-in prior to arrival and using the bell-hop service until room is ready! Didn’t necessarily need the key if you get the app to access the elevator (for 24/25th floors) and your rooms. Amazing food options especially the Pantry!!    Please be aware that anytime you’re staying in hotels they typically charge you up front for incidentals. There’s nothing notifying you via email or in the app about it but be mindful of what card you have for check-in!    Other than that great location and access to the strip!
10,Please look at what I wrote previously and there should be notes under my stay. Terrible experience and when I called to get some sort of compensation I only got attitude and a refund of one night of a resort fee when I stayed three nights. I won’t be returning.
10,As a military family our vacations can be limited. We had never been to Vegas. We called ourselves doing our homework as far as the mirage went. We checked in ran to a few stores came back parked our vehicle is there is no valet parking due to Covid which we understand. We have two rooms both were filthy with hair in the tubes one room had toenails stuck in the carpet our room smelled of mildew the carpet was black with stains. We took pictures which are time-stamped. The hotel supervisor stated she will be taken care of Resort fees the fee should have been 0 I would not allow anyone to stay in that hotel sadly it is such a great area and most of the staff is awesome. The Casino is nice the staff is slow there. My biggest issues were we were not able to sleep peacefully due to the nasty room. Maybe next time somewhere else in Vegas.
30,First off no coffee pots in rooms and the Starbuck lines are impossible. We had a dated room the main mirror light was out when we arrived but they did fix it within a few hours of us reporting it. 1 USB plug was not working so you are limited in what you can do if you don't bring plugs. There are no usb ports near the beds. The waitress in the Still was poor and the girl taking the orders got it wrong. The Pantry had good food and waiters. The Center bar had a good bartender. The pool bar is expensive and the bartender seemed put upon. Seemed like a lot of places we wanted to go to were not open nor did they open the 5 nights we were there.
30,I stayed at the Mirage when it first opened I was impressed by everything from the lobby to the casino the restaurants the rooms. This time I went I noticed the deterioration everywhere. M Life casinos are the only ones without progressive jackpot for the table games. Very disappointed.
50,Would recommend staying at the Mirage! Our room was spacious and beautiful with a nice view of the pool. The staff was very friendly and courteous and made you feel welcome. The rooms were also very quiet.
40,"I chose this hotel because it had a hospitality suite with two bedrooms and I was traveling with my family. Since I have four kids I can rarely find a place where we can all stay together and not just in rooms next door to each other. The suite looked like a fun place with a huge couch table and TV area and the two separate bedrooms.    First impression on walking into the hotel is lovely. The flowers waterfall and pond are very pretty. The casino and restaurant areas looked fine and it was nice to have the ""Snacks"" quick-service place with chicken fingers burgers club sandwiches and all the things kids like.    However upon entering the room I could hardly see a thing. Because the hotel is older there are no traditional ceiling lights - it's all lamp light the occasional pendant light or shower can. It felt enclosed dark and worn. The baseboards were broken in the basement. The doors didn't shut without shoving them together. The locks were missing in places. The light switch plate was crooked on the wall. The carpet was stained. I wasn't expecting new but I was hoping it wouldn't be quite so beat up. It's a nice large space but wow it needs some care.    On to the pool area. The waterfalls make it really fun for kids. You can rent a nice heavy raft that will keep them occupied for most of the day for $20. You do have to get there right when it opens or you will not find a chair. If you get there a little later you will only find chairs set back from the pool where people are allowed to smoke. If you have young kids you may not want this. The second day I rented a cabana and our experience was incredible. The area is shaded they stock the fridge with water and sodas bring a platter of fruit and have snacks on the countertops. 100% worth it. Wouldn't ever NOT rent one for a day at the pool. Little pricey but worth it.    I might stay there again for the pool and the lower food prices at the Snacks place compared to other hotels. Also LOVE the frozen yogurt right by the pool entrance."
40,We enjoyed a nice 3-day Las Vegas vacation with great rates in a great location on the Vegas Strip. The room price was great and the rooms and cleanliness were excellent. However several of the restaurants were still closed from the covid panic so dining options were more limited than normal. Overall a good time.
30,My family spent one night at the Mirage. It was an average experience. The hotel was extremely crowded. Not sure whether it was due to Spring Break or everybody wanting to vacation with Covid wanting. People were everywhere. The pool area looked like seals beached on the shores during mating season. The casino and even elevator areas were packed. We had to wait an hour to get a spot at the pool. Be sure to get on the waiting list early or book a cabana. The food was expensive. Breakfast for three (two adults and a child) cost $75. The hotel room was reasonably priced at about $150/night. The room was comfortable. The AC was strong. The bedding was above average. The shower was strong.    In the future I’d pay for a more expensive hotel to get less crowds.
40,Room was a let down for a penthouse suite. View was hindered by window having the sign/tint over it. Couch was not comfortable. Hot water was barely warm in the tub. Bathroom was great otherwise. Room was cleaned well
50,A beautiful hotel with outstanding service. Under the COVID circumstances everything was organized quite well. I love the location - right in the center of the strip. Sarah bent over backwards to help resolve a double booking by Priceline. Will definitely stay there again.
20,Everything was fine until we were cleaning up to check out. I found a nasty stiff sock by one of the beds (I picked it up thinking it was ours disgusting!). My wife called help desk to report it and asked to be more carefull when cleaning the rooms as this was disgusting help desk employee stated he was going to send a Manager to check this out after 20-30 minutes of waiting I gave up and stepped out I let the house keeper next door know about the sock to prevent future guest from finding that disgusting sock again. As stated everything was fine until this happened right before we checked out
30,After getting off the plane they wouldn't let me check until later I was tired and wanted to go to my Room. OK I got to my Room I had no hot water for my shower. The next day when I went to the pool people would get there early run out put towels in chairs to holder space leave and come back hours later. Not cool
50,Mirage still classy clean rooms and entertaining after all the years. Younger energetic crowd on the weekend.  Perfect location...near Venetian and Caesar’s  Will definitely stay here again this summer as the pool is excellent.  ~Papgorgio
30,I understand with COVID some dining establishments had to close however this hotel was busy and packed on a Saturday night You had 2 dining choices sushi or the steak house The Still could have been an option but it was closed for a private party. The normally open 24 hour coffee shops closes at 3pm. The only dining option was the snack shop which has overcooked food. So staying at this hotel you had to leave it to find dining options. Going across the street to MC D or Panda Express was a better alternative than the Snack shops food. Had a $50 dining credit could not use because nothing was open.
50,Very accommodating and excellent service in all areas. Food is excellent great access to and from the Las Vegas Strip and easy access to the freeways to travel to other parts of Las Vegas. The bell staff was also very professional friendly and helpful always. The check in process was smooth and easy the dining options were all top quality food and wine too.
30,The rooms were extremely dirty. We got moved 3 different times each very dirty. After moving so many time we just stayed in the third room. The restaurant close very very early or are packed and can’t take you. On the other hand the front desk was very nice when handling our room situation and all of the mirage employees were very polite.
40,We love the Mirage but upon check in our room looked like it wasn’t cleaned thoroughly and appeared someone had possibly taken a nap in the made bed. However it was quickly handled. Key cards were transferred over in the moment and our bellman helped us get situated in the reassigned room before he left. I’m only giving an average for room as the first one was bad and the new one was good.
50,Rooms were nice and clean. Requested quite room away from elevators. Request was given. Had great tv channels for before bed. I would definitely stay here again if price was reasonable. We got a good deal this time around.
10,The pool was too cold for anyone to go  Even the in pool lifeguard got too cold and had to end their shift early  Our daughter got too cold and we couldn’t take her in anymore  Also you can’t store any personal items in a fridge which was hard since we had babies with us who need milk  And room service is only 9am to 3pm so limited. And concierge room service and show bookings all didn’t answer the phone  In fact most of the time it was impossible to reach staff from the room at all. Very weird
40,We came for a visit while celebrating our anniversary. Arrived on Wednesday and got to check in early. We had a basic room which was clean and had a nice view looking out over Harrah's and the High Roller. Plenty of closet and drawer space. Bathroom is a bit small but clean. Great water pressure in the shower and nice towels. Bed was comfy. Quick walk to Venetian or Caesars. The pool is beautiful and relaxing with a tropical feel. Drink service is friendly and quick at the pool. Order a Dole Whip. it's so delicious!
10,Random room charges pool limit and reduced hours for the pool. Covid is more contagious after 5 in a pool I guess. Weak pool drinks for $30. If you want a seat at the pool you better buy one days in advance or wait in line starting at 8 to make sure you can get in. Thankfully I got in but I don't need that stress when my whole day was gonna be a pool day and 10 ppl after me they cut off entry. Reduced capacity should mean reduce your hours too.    It's a hell of a hike to get to your room too. Got a coffee and went to my car and racked up 2500 steps. I don't mind but if you don't like to walk thru a whole casino to get to your elevator don't stay here.    Honestly it's not all the hotels fault it's the ridiculous covid rules but they aren't making it easier. They keep half the stuff closed so you just have all the people funneling into what's left .
20,miserable but due to all the restrictions and closures it was to be expected staff could have been more accommodating under the circumstances superbowl party(only 50 persons per party) was the highlight of my long weekend
30,Everything was great except they’re holding about $1200 hostage in pre-authorizations on my credit card. Spoke to the head cashier who said it could take up to ten business days for these authorizations to be released. It’s been fifteen. They don’t seem to have an answer as to why they’re still pending.
50,Confortable great location close to everything. Staff was super helpful. Easy check in and easy check out. Missed not having a poker room but other close casinos had them so nothing lost there. I recommend 100%
50,The rooms were comfortable. Foods available was good. The gaming area were smoke free and spaced well with Covid protocols. Several area in pool were spaced to allow Covid practice too. Cabana were nice  a lil tight on space ... Overall good resort
10,We took the cocktail waitress $5 and then she didn't come back for awhile and when she did we noticed she gave our drinks away to some other dude and then when we confronted her about it she said it was our fault for moving but we were literally the machine next to the machine that we ordered the drink from and we also had to get our room switched multiple times because we walked in and they were just trashed each and every time
40,Prime location on the strip but our room wasn’t that clean. If it wasn’t for the room cleanliness it would be 5 stars. We had dirty wash clothes hanging in the shower and a few blood stains on our bedding. Gross
10,Disgusting staff if you go to the pool just ask for Dana she’s all they got. Other than that the slum of Las Vegas at your service if you choose to stay here you are truly going to be very disappointed; trust me — I’m a doctor.
10,Customer service was horrible and the glass in my breakfast. Our first room the bed was broken the 2nd one it stunk like mildew the third one the ac didn’t work!! We will never stay at the mirage ever again!!
30,Good- Amazing staff! Beautiful hotel! Great spot. Bad-AC was broken in the room not resolved everything closes early in the hotel you have to make a trek to get food after like 10pm. Overall good experience.
40,I hope to come back Soon.  Very Knowledgeable Helpfull and Friendly.  Tables layout makes it Easy to find a table. The staff was VERY good at making sure ALL surfaces were clean and wiped down. This included regular wipe downs of the dice
40,Nice hotel clean insides amazing smell clean nice size rooms  Could use an extra blanket on bed no fridge or water provided no microwave . Very long walk from the lobby to guest elevators makes a difference after long day walking around or ncjeckinf in from traveling o was on the 18th floor in the middle and there was some really loud noise from a machine (maybe staff laundry) and it goes all day and all night very annoying when trying to sleep. It woke me up a few time in the night I was a little startled waking up in the middle of the night from it.
20,Everything is way over priced. Most restaurants not open. Rooms are mediocre for the price. Not worth it. I have stayed at Holiday Inns with nicer rooms. Cost me $22 for 2 bottles of water and a lemonade. $60 for room service breakfast for 1. Half the stuff isn’t open. Sucked.
10,This is worst hotel on the strip. They false advertise the staff hate their jobs and will try to ruin your trip. The pools are freezing and not heated. The dolphins are being mistreated. I was electrocuted in room by faulty power outlet. I watched hotel guest be harassed by hateful and angry lifeguards. Instead of serving drinks and food at pool waiters and waitresses take no orders and use their time to harass people in pool to wear masks. The wait staff tries to draw guest into arguments about whether they are doing activities that don’t require a mask or not. This hotel needs new management.
40,I have stayed in Vegas many many times but for some reason had never made it to the Mirage so this time I did book a room there. The resort is beautiful and the rooms are nice and comfy. Granted they may be a tad outdated but they are so well kept and maintained that I did not see that as a negative at all. The staff was very friendly and helpful and overall I felt very welcome and comfortable. I loved visiting the dolphin and white tiger and lion habitat and I was in awe of these magical and magnificent creatures. In my head I thanked the late Siegfried and Roy a thousand times for loving and preserving these beautiful and majestic animals the way they did. We can never repay them for that.  As for the resort I loved the pool area as it is truly an oasis. I personally felt that there were a bit too many kids at the pool so it was not as relaxed as I would have liked it to be but I guess there is nothing I can do about that. I also personally do not feel that Vegas is really a place for children but that's neither here nor there.  I did have an issue with the crappy internet though. I am paying a hefty resort fee each day for internet use but the internet kept going in an out constantly for the entire duration of my stay. First I thought the internet was weak because I was on the 11th floor but it turned out that the connection issue was the same all over the resort and casino unfortunately. Other than that I loved my stay and I may come back.
50,We did a staycation over Spring Break. Mask wearing and social distancing were enforced. Our room was very clean. The volcano was running and the Secret Garden was open. We also went to the pool. Easy check-in.
40,On this trip I did not get to the pool but it is a great pool. I like to have the water from the waterfall thump down on my head. I think they need to get rid of 6:5 payout for player blackjack and go back to 3:2 and they have put in roulette tables with not just a 0 and 00 but another green that has the company logo on it. This is not a good business move. roulette is already huge advantage to the house why the greed? and don't say pandemic. Otherwise it was a great experience and I love the Mirage.
20,Bathroom way to small. Too many kids making noise yelling and slamming doors. No sleep. We missed a whole day due to a bad flight w frontier (hint) Mirage still charged us a resort fee for the missed day.
30,Overall the hotel was amazing super clean. Reason why I don’t mark i higher is the ridiculous price for food. And the quality of the food is gas station quality. Also if you don’t tip be prepared to hear employees complain
10,This property under delivers a ton. Staywell is a marketing gimmick.. A light and a air purifier shouldn't run you 30 more per night. No amenities in room like a fridge or even a coffee maker but you can buy the $10 fiji water bottle.  The location is ok though bellagio has more upscale surrounding shops.  The dolphin habitat is way overpriced but so are all extras here including room service
40,It’s center of the strip very accessible. To all other major hotels. It was nice I just wish I had a better view and a refrigerator in the room that was not full of their drinks for purchase. That was cheesy!
50,As an M life member I've have stayed at the Mirage three times now and we really enjoy this property. The cabana staff are second to none (shout out to our amazing host Ariel) and rest of the Mirage staff are are excellent & very helpful. The dolphins are pretty amazing too!
30,I just remember the Mirage having very nice rooms. It seemed a little run down in great need of some remodeling. Also the Check in was a little confusing with the app. You can hear the noise in the hallway like if the door was open. Over all still like the Mirage.
30,Expected rooms to be perfect. Especially for this Hotel being one of the best in Vegas. Shower had no hot water and water barely came out. It took forever for someone to fix it. It took time away from our vacation.
20,We stayed 4 nights and it was the longest trip of my life. Use mobile check in for sure! The lines for check-in are insane (as are ALL LINEs for everything in this hotel). Our room was HOT and after calling twice to ask for someone to come fix it...... I slept in a HOT hotel room IN the desert for 4 days. I guess they don't want you in the room anyway. The staff here are rude and disinterested. Room service is NOT an option... I think. I could not get anyone to answer the phone when I tried. The lines into the restaurants are insane 2 hours. AND to get a cup of coffee is a trek that will take you hours. It's sad to see how much this hotel has gone down in service. I purchased a volcano view room and all I really had was a view of the bright ass lights from the atrium. The lines to get into the pool (which I heard was ice cold) was to long for me to wait in. But you wait in line for everything here. Vegas is NOT the same vegas that is used to be. The amount of small children walking around the hotel and through the casino is mind boggling. Even at midnight. The streets are filled with trash. It's sad really.
30,They make you put a deposit down and make it sound like you will be getting a refund for the difference. But you actually have to pay for the Room also and then wait 2 days for the deposit to come back after check out. So a $132 Room actually ends up being $432 which is $300 more than expected and that was money I would have preferred to use elsewhere. The restaurant was booked and the communication between the concierge desk and the restaurant is lacking. VERY CLEAN! Everything is very expensive. Beds are mediocre. Pool is great/ wonderful! I like to be spontaneous on trips and I couldn't really enjoy myself and just walk around because we had to have A reservation for everything!! Time constraints caused stress which isn't what we want on vacation. Should Also offer shuttle to airport.
40,Mirage is very easy to get around the hotel was excellent in implementing social distancing. The only complaint was the pool was freezing!! The rooms were nice as well friendly staff. I love the vibe there the dolphin habitat is amazing.
40,Awesome will recommend this hotel and look forward to the next time in Vegas. Food at the restaurants in the Mirage on the expensive side but that is the trend in Vegas. Only was able to stay two nights but wish it would have been longer
30,Dated hotel with a great location. Pool closes at 6 PM which doesn’t give most people an opportunity to even be able to use it. The wallpaper was Pete peeling off the walls on level five and the exit sign was destroyed. There is no valet parking so to get to the hotel you have to park take a elevator to level four walk across take an escalator down walk through the casino take another elevator to finally get to your room. Literally took over 25 minutes to get to room.
20,Extremely difficult to talk to a real person on the phone. Long wait lines at check-in. It is highly recommended that you check in online previous to arriving unfortunately the website or app was not helpful either.
10,sink was clogged and room was dusty and wasn't cleaned thoroughly. i told the staff about my issue and they said the weekend was sold out of king beds for my type of room and couldn't help with switching rooms.
20,There was lots of dust on the wall and headboard and the bath tub was dirty . Had to call front desk not nice at all. Finally manager offered maid to come clean it after hour. Never staying here again! Disappointed
10,You get what you pay for here at the Mirage. It smells like weed everywhere even in the hallways of the non smoking floors. It's nearly impossible to get any food without at least an hour wait. And the food is not good once you wait for it. Room service is very limited and not 24 hours as advertised. The trash in the room was not emptied from the previous guest. And there are children everywhere including the casino floor. It was impossible to go to the pool because of all the children. Overall a very disappointing stay.
30,First off we found a roach crawling on our bed upon check-in while trying to unpack and get ready for dinner reservation. Hotel didn't do much to make us feel better or accommodate us better just switched us to a different room and on a lower floor than what we originally had. We were on the look out the rest of the time we were there and didn't sleep as good not knowing what other creatures might be crawling around in our room.
10,No fridge in room bathtub drains clogged air didn’t work staff is rude escalator broken blinds will not close safe didn’t work closet light wouldn’t turn off vending machines broken on every floor except 1!!! Awful!!!
40,"My stay at The Mirage was about as close to perfect as you can get. They are offering a mobile check-in option and also digital keys right on the app -- I loved this feature I didn't need to use my room key one just held my phone to the card reader and done.  The room was a little be dated but perfectly clean the bed was nice and comfortable and the bathroom was well appointed. The only two things that perfected a perfect 5 circle stay are: 1. the heating and cooling the ""smart"" thermostat turns the heating/cooling off when it doesn't detect motion so if you don't flail in your sleep or when you leave the room the temperature in the room is no longer at your ideal temp. 2 is it would nice to have a refrigerator in the room without having to ask."
20,Rooms were outdated dirty and carpets damaged. I used to stay at the mirage every trip but will not again. Staff was great but the casino didn’t have enough table games available. Next time I am going to stay at ceasers or across the street where they are putting money make into the hotel.
30,Maybe scored a little high but our stay wasn’t that great. I guess I had bigger expectations. No coffee pot in the room no room service after 3pm not so friendly staff. Ice machine and vending machine was broken our entire stay. No answer at the concierge‘s desk I actually called another’s hotel concierge. Room was humid and Ac didn’t work great. Pool was freezing. I mean like so cold it shocks you. I booked this hotel thinking it would be better then some of their competitors.
50,We have stayed at the Mirage previously and enjoyed it. When we decided to consider the Mirage again we research reviews and noticed a lot of negative reviews. Our room was very clean. Everyone we encountered was very friendly. They are very strict on wearing your masks in the pool area and around the resort. I completely respect that. We have nothing but positive things to say about our stay!
30,Walking into the hotel I was amazed at the friendly staff. The lobby was gorgeous! Casino area all public spaces were clean . Pool was amazing. I was very impressed until I entered our room. Probably one of the smallest hotel bathrooms I have ever had. No outlets near bed to plug in C-Pap machine or phones. No fridge access unless you want to pay to open the door. Room was decent size but not much sitting space
20,Not what I expected got treated better at Cesars once they matched my tier wish I could have had better time but resort fees for a platinum member is ridiculous when I come to Vegas to gamble and not use no amenities just go from all casinos....
10,Pool was too cold to even use. Pool was empty of guests. Hotel is very aware that pool is useless in the spring/winter months but purposely misleads people of fact. Other hotels best pools to 80-82 degrees but not this one. Unless your a polar bear — skip this hotel.
50,The Mirage is an excellent Hotel with beautiful rooms good service and beautiful swimming pools and a beautiful Volcano show in front of the hotel  good directors of housekeeping  security and very safe to enjoy time.
30,The Mirage is a beautiful resort and very clean but if you are looking to come here to sit by the pool don’t bother. Unfortunately you will then have no choice but to leave your resort to keep busy and deal with the trash on the streets. Vegas is awful and has gone downhill since the last time we visited. The stay well room at the Mirage was wonderful and great for allergy sufferers but you do not come to Vegas to sit in the room. We came to enjoy the pool but unfortunately there were never any seats available. So upsetting since this is what we came for. They say they monitor the chairs but most of them are empty with the towels on them for a long time. Ridiculous!!! Also everyone was complaining that the pool water was ice cold. They should not advertise it as heated. I was very disappointed that we couldn’t use the pool. The resort itself is beautiful and the people are super friendly. However  we will never do Las Vegas again unless it changes . Gross! It has changed tremendously which is very sad.
40,This hotel is gorgeous and the experience was great! I will definitely return again. The rooms are ok. We had a problem with the first room but the staff was very accommodating and immediately gave us a new one.
20,Nice hotel but if you wanted a pool experience call ahead of time. They said it was running and heated but it was ice cold!! Pantry is a great breakfast sit inside the hotel. Just get the online schedule quick as it fills up.
50,We very much enjoyed our stay at this property. Very friendly staff and clean rooms. Their pool is the best. We love the waterfalls and the volcano view room which we were upgraded to for free for our anniversary.
50,Superb service and friendly staff!! I did not have any issues or bad experiences. The staff helped me in every way without an attitude! The mirage is the best hotel to stay at on the strip and it’s inexpensive!!
40,Didn’t spend much time in the room was too busy hiking overall easy check in and check out with mobile app wish gym was open longer and earlier should be a Q for the app to sign up for the pool or other stuff like the restaurant
30,If you’re looking for a fancy hotel with excellent shopping and dining options this isn’t the place. But if you want somewhere that is in the middle of the strip with friendly staff this is your best bet. I recently stayed during the week (not the weekday) which is why I got a decent hotel rate. The hotel and the rooms are outdated and clean badly in the stench of the cigarette smoke on the first floor is unbearable at times. The pool was the best part of this hotel experience.
20,We checked in on a Sunday went to sleep and was abruptly woken up to strangers entering my room. We called the front desk just to find out our reservations magically disappeared and our room was booked again by another couple.
40,Love the location ... casino was clean though waited for drink when playing and it never arrived...rooms amazing love the bed it felt comfortable..but hair in bathroom towels ... nobody knew scheduled for water show but good experience will return
20,Just a mismanaged mess by the MGM group.  Negatives:  -One restaurant open for breakfast.  -Mlife app never updated - things that were closed listed as open.  -Impossible to get information - forget calling as the general number has a 30 minute wait.  - Clientele is a bit sketchy.  Positives:  - room was clean  - pool is lovely looking (but not heated so ice cold)
30,"We did a two night stay recently at The Mirage. We booked the 2-bedroom Tower suite. Firstly the room does NOT look like the pictures. Secondly it isn't really a two bedroom suite. It is a one bedroom suite that they put next to another adjoining room and you can open the adjoining room door and use that room too. Kind of a shady way to describe it. They wanted us to check in on the phone app. We did and it does have a cool feature that becomes the room key. the only thing is that if you get the ""2-bedroom"" suite the electronic key will only open one door. so I had to trek back downstairs to get a second key for my adjoining room. There is no coffee maker in the room. that wouldn't be a problem but there is NO WAY to get coffee in this giant hotel until 6am. Then it is a wait in line with 30 other people at the Starbucks. Room service is only from 7am-3pm (so the hours most are out of their rooms). I feel like much of what bothered us at the Mirage was that it felt like these decisions were made to be convenient for the hotel rather than the guest. i'm sure they would say it is because of Covid but this place was PACKED. That excuse wouldn't fly with me or anyone who was there. All staff members were courteous and friendly. The view from our two rooms was pretty cool too. As in all casinos the smoke smell was horrendous but I don't know what they can do about that. All in all not a bad stay. I just think management needs to look at themselves in the mirror and ask if they are managing for the customer or for themselves."
50,This hotel is a great choice to stay would recommend the rooms are very clean and the service is great. The check in was fast and simple through their mobile app would recommend to dowload it if you trying to skip the line.
50,This was out first trip to Vegas & post covid. It was wonderful although there were still covid restrictions. The Mirage was wonderful to stay at & we will definitely be back next year. Also the breakfast at The Pantry is one of the best ever!
40,Great hotel. Clean. Great location. Might be time for some carpeting updates in the guest room. Beds were comfortable and the mobile app check in is the way to go. I loved being able to use my phone as my door and elevator key.
50,The Mirage is one of the best places in Vegas to bring the entire family. Plenty to do for children and adults. Very good restaurants and shopping stores. The pool area is to die for and the location is center to the whole strip.
40,Started out poor but quickly improved to a great stay. Heritage steakhouse was excellent housekeeping was very friendly and inviting. Safety precautions were used throughout the facility and even when you took your mask of multiple people were monitoring making sure that everybody was safe Can’t wait to return 💕💕
50,I have a good time at the hotel. Pool was good temperature for the weather. Only thing I would change is the carpets. They look a bit crusty. Overall all its was a good time with good vibes. I’m looking forward to another stay there.
10,The black mold that was found was unacceptable and unfortunate and the staff was very vague about the whole thing  And that was just crazy and it took them two times to at the end comp. one night and a suite and it just was all bad
50,Thank you for the opportunity to stay at an amazing hotel! I went on a journey to find the love of my life. Thank you for the experience it was hard at times but so grateful for all the amazing people I met on the way. Thank you!
30,Tooth paste was all the bathroom wall from last guests blood spot on the bathroom floor told them about it no one came to clean it.. Was supposed to have veiw of strip did not happen i got the view of the pool.. Sheet had a bigg rip on the corner .. Asked for room service for more towles the next day they showed up over all it was not the best place to stay but it is right on the strip and that was a huge convince
40,Good location nice room. Our room faced the volcano. It was nice to be able to watch the eruption show from our room. Due to covid still limited availability with respect to restaurants so if you didn't plan well in advance your options within the hotel were very limited. Siegfried and Roy's Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat is located in the hotel. It is nice to see but a little price. The hotel was in a good central location and within walking distance to many other destinations on the strip.
50,We had a great overall stay staff was nice room was clean. But what I really wanted to mention is that this is probably the best and tastiest food I ate at a Vegas Hotel Restaurant so far. This was our 5th visit I was blown away by the quality at Pantry and Osteria Costa.
40,Really great service at the hotel. Very clean and lots of Covid-safety measures in place. However we found it very hard to navigate what was open and closed as Vegas begins to open. Make plans and call ahead-don’t rely on what is posted.
40,Would have given a 5 if not for the toiled the hotel was great and the room would have been great but the toiled was broke. I had already unpacked and was settled so I didn't want to change room. They had to replace the hole toiled but great after that.
50,My girlfriend and I went away for a my birthday and had a great time. Looking forward to doing it again. The staff the cashiers were amazing rooms were clean layout was great. Food was amazing. Recommend taking a trip and seeing Las Vegas
50,Had an early flight into Las Vegas and my room was still available for check-in right as I arrived. Check-in was quick and easy and staff throughout the resort were kind friendly and helpful. The pool as well was fantastic. Overall great value for the price and fantastic stay overall.
30,this is a nice hotel for one of the older ones and is in a good location right off the strip very easy to walk and right across from the mall parking is good if you are renting a car they also have good food
50,Great view the location was perfect and the service was exceptional definitely recommend. Went for a four day three night stay with my husband for his birthday and everything was walking distance also recommend the deuce bus definitely worth $8. Best vacation thus far.
50,This is the 3rd or 4th time we have stayed here. The location is fantastic centrally located on the strip. Beautifully decorated resort. Rooms are updated. Staff is always exceptional. We were disappointed that the buffets were closed. Everything in Vegas shuts down a little early due to COVID.
30,nice getaway. too bad mirage removed all of they're 3 quarter slot machines. they were our favorite but we will try too get used to the pennies and maybe once in a while dollars. check in was terrible. Room was on a floor and all we smelled was marijuana.
50,I prefer a large tub and couldn't use the mini fridge because I would have been charged for removing the items. It was very clean close to everything north strip and the staff was absolutely fantastic!
10,worst experience ever at the mirage and I have been staying there for 20 years ..  fist fights  constant pot smoking throughout casino and no one says anything about it ...  check in was a night mare  VIP pool was a joke paid good money to be told we can no longer pick the chairs they are now assigned .. which mine were in the shade .. not the reason to sit by the pool in the sunshine not shade  Hotel is going down hill quick .. AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH COVID
30,Our go to hotel in Vegas is getting old. Perhaps time for a makeover. I know covid has hurt all the Vegas hotels so I don't want to pick on Mirage. Just showing signs of its age. Still not a bad place at all
50,Nice place clean and spacious  Be very careful of the refrigerator usage policy. REFRIGERATOR IS NOT FOR PERSONAL USE.  You will get charged even if you don’t open items will have to go to customer service desk to dispute charges and ask for corrections refunds!
10,Poor rooms with zero plugs at the nightstands for charging. Almost no plugs anywhere near a table. The bed was old. We had a suit overlooking the volcano and strip but you can barely see out the window and the drapes were all messed up. Service was a 1 star from the front desk to the room service. Almost 2 hours to get breakfast at the only restaurant open for breakfast. The list goes on. Just not the GEM of the strip anymore. Stay somewhere else.
30,I've always loved The Mirage and have always stayed here. It's been clean fairly priced and is centered located on the strip but I have seen a decline. The rooms and hallways need better attention. Pool is nice and staff is friendly and would i would still stay here from time to time but I'm for sure going to try other hotels as well.
20,Staying the mirage was very nice but  The rooms had mold around the tub and on the shower head it was very dirty and poor quality . My toilet didn’t flush at all we went and bought a plunger house keeping didn’t fix issuw
10,Room was not ready at check in time period. Had to cancel our anniversary dinner reservation because we didn't have enough time to shower change and get ready for dinner because our Room was ready late.
20,The Hotel service team isn't ready for you! No Bellhops to speak of..we packed 2 loads of luggage and golf clubs to our rooms..checkin was over 1hour wait! The Service was overall a 0! And by no means do you go to the Cashier line and miss the sign that says Cashier this way and MLife card this way..The Mgr Will rip you a new one and call security on you.  CHANGE MY MIND MIRAGE!
30,This hotel is not very business friendly. Don't expect housekeeping to be timely with your request. Very expensive to eat in any of their restaurants. If you're gambling and want to be in the center of the strip it's a great location.
20,Not that clean the window was loose the lighting switch cover was broken good restaurants some rude staffs there was a good Asian & Italian restaurant with delicious foods nice bar area smells of smoke in non smoking rooms
40,The Mirage remains a solid value located central on the Strip. Lots of food options inside as well as walking distance nearby. Within short drive of Asia town food and local shopping too. I wish they would update their rooms they are beginning to show wear but the staff has been friendly and helpful- that is quite appreciated.
50,They are an awesome place to stay! Their staff is incredible Pool is awesome and their rooms are comfortable🤙🤙 We stayed their during spring break and are residents of Las Vegas and chose Mirage for their paradise theme do to us being from Hawaii. It’s in a perfect location at the center of the strip. So much activities to do around this hotel and in this hotel🤙
50,My husband and I had a great time at the Mirage. Great price for hotel and restaurants. The hotel was clean. The size of the room was perfect. Lots of drawers for storing your belongings. Centrally located on the strip.
50,Everything was on point from top to bottom check in room staff check out parking and most importantly cleanliness. It was my first time stay and the Mirage and it was amazing I look forward to making another trip soon!!!
50,"The Mirage was great but Las Vegas has gone way down hill. I have been to Vegas dozens of times but never again. All they young people are walking around smoking pot. It smells so bad. So many undesirables laying all over the sidewalks. I asked one of them why they do not go to a shelter and the reply was ""I make so much money sitting here on the street why would I leave. Neither the shop owners or police make us leave so why would we""? Completely unacceptable! Never again."
30,I gave only an average review because after staying there I went and stayed at the Venician resort which is amazing. Mirage is a fine resort located in the middle of the strip and has a decent cost. loved my room and liked the Still restaurant. Casino had way too many blackjack tables the paid blackjack 6 to 5 which is terrible for the player.
50,The hotel was gorgeous. The pool was beautiful. We went with three teenage girls who had a wonderful time. They loved the Secret Garden’s and the Dolphin Show. The Mirage has awesome restaurants snd good service. And it’s located conveniently for both activities or fun sightseeing. We stayed at five different beautiful hotels during our stay. The Mirage was one of our favorites.
50,Get your money’s worth. This resort has all you need. Style good food cocktails pool shopping variety of entertainment. Serves to the single crowd as well as to families and pets. What more can you ask for? Oh and yes complimentary parking.
20,All machines on the floor were not working not in use one night. Tried to get the ticket out of the machine had to get it via hand pay waited for it for good 15-20 mins I believe. Went other casinos to play cuz I wasnt sure if machines would be working properly.  While I was there I experienced FIRST of the following which I have never experienced from other casino stays. Fire alarm was on while in sleep but it was false alarm. I do not know how it went on but it was on for about 8-10 mins. I could not go back to sleep felt unsafe & unsecured since there was incident in Vegas. Other thing was housekeepers I requested for late check out but they kept knocking on the door after 11 AM trying to open w their key card talking at the door etc for about 4 times. I dont know if I got it waived or comps covered it but overall not satisfied at all.
50,My girlfriend and I drove out from LA for a 3 night stay for a friends wedding . To say the least we booked our stay and weren't expecting much . BUT OH MY GOD. The staff the room readiness and cleanliness was nothing short of perfection . The casino and resort was also so amazing the staff all around made our stay easily our best Vegas stay to date will definitely make this our primary hotel from now on .
20,The clientele has gone downhill since my last stay. The bathroom was dirty when we checked in and it took 45 mins for someone to clean it. All the restaurants are 25% capacity and closed early. Very frustrating trip.
50,A wonderful experience of Las Vegas and downtown. The people were super nice everywhere we went meaning staff. Felt safe even with covid going on! We will be returning soon! Next trip will be an adult trip
30,Our room was dirty and our friends room had a dirty towel still in it. Ours also smelled of smoke. They had no rooms to change to but did refund our resort fees which was nice they were very polite and wanted to help fix the problem. It seems they just need to update and or clean their hotel and rooms a little better. The elevators all seemed to need some work done on them as well. Friendly staff and the pool was nice and clean.
30,I thought that this hotel would be of a higher standard than what I experienced this March. Long line to check in and also check out of hotel. They did provide a tiny cooling unit for me to use in the room. Location was excellent on the strip. It is just okay.
20,Had to move rooms 3 times and last room had a leaky toilet water all over floor I was not given any kind of upgrade just got moved to another room with problems. Would of been nice to have been upgraded to suite for having to be moved 3 times
50,....Great place to stay at with family...!  ....Rooms are clean and staff are friendly....it’s like in the middle of the strip so u get to see everything..!  ....  i will stay here again when I have another vacation...!  I recommend it to everyone....!
30,Needed blankets and pillows and more towels called 2x and nothing so I had to go get them my self from a staff that was passing by. I asked the staff for blankets they said I had to call front desk I did but still never got what I asked for very disappointed but other then that hotel is nice and good location
50,We had a wonderful time. Staff were particularly friendly! Our room had a wonderful view of the strip. We also felt we got very good value for the cost of our meals at both Otoro and Costa restaurants.
50,The over all trip and stay at the Mirage was amazing and I enjoyed the room and the experience I had lots of fun with my friends and just seeing the overall city and I can’t wait to return back and do it all over again
20,Rooms not upgraded and elevators were broken. Shower not working properly dirty floors looked like they haven't been vacuumed in years. It would be nice for them to upgrade the hotel and add newer amenities to the rooms like a refrigerator and microwave other than one stocked with high priced snacks.
40,The staff was great but the hotel was just okay. The room didn’t have anything special about it. You had to pay to use the refrigerator in the room. The price was good but I stayed in other MGM properties that I thought was better.
40,beautiful place great location easy in and out when you want.  food was excellent.  The one thing I would recommend they need is to have more sanitation more hand sanitizers near the machines need sanitizing wipes near the machines. Not enough sanitizers in the casino.
50,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel! My only complaint is that there was food left in our refrigerator from the previous guests (or maybe longer). There was about a half inch of mold growing from the food. This was concerning as I’m extremely allergic to mold. I put it in a bag and sat it on the tables in the center of the hallway leading to the elevators. I work in customer service/food so I completely understand that sometimes things get overlooked. The room was in excellent condition outside of the food left in the refrigerator. Other than that issue and the lengthy time it took to have our luggage delivered our stay was absolutely what we needed and better than we expected. It was peaceful in the room but very lively downstairs at the casino. It was a perfect way to balance peace and quiet along with that Las Vegas flare!
50,The only problem was the beds were a little messed up. The head of the bed was much lower than the foot. Box spring problem mattress problem. It made for bad sleep. It was not great. The bathroom is small tub small. But it's still a nice hotel in a great location.
30,The location is perfect right at the heart of the strip the staff were great.  The hotel room was very noisey. You can hear everything from the neighboring room and in the hallways.  Would think twice about staying again.
50,This hotel is close to everyone and wall of the staff was exceptionally nice and helpful. Due to Covid a lot of their restaurants were closed but we still had a great time. Front desk staff was very helpful and we had no major issues. I’d stay here again!
30,People arguing and fighting in my floor did not get sleep. Security and radios going on and off waking me and family up. Finally fell asleep passed 4 am had to wake up 5 hrs later for check out ! Which they knocked in my door at 8 am to remind me to check out!
40,We loved the staff and location of this hotel. Everyone was very welcoming. We brought a 7 yr old with us and it wasn't an issue at all. Our only complaint was that the 1 bdrm suite was looking a bit worn down. The furniture had scratches and dings. The office chair had no support in it. The bdrm TV is supposed to come up from the foot of the bed when watching and go back down when done. Ours was broken and only stayed up. The mattress pillow top was worn out and very hard. Even with these few issues we would stay again. The view was awesome and with a little refresh the room would be perfect.
30,The experience would’ve been much better if we were allowed access to the in room refrigerator. Having it locked with items inside that you charge the guests for made no sense to me. Empty the fridge and let the guest use it. If you want to charge for items add mini-bars to the rooms and lock those.
20,Mobile check in appeared to work but once we got in the elevator we couldn't use my phone for the elevator to get us to our floor so had to go back to check in. Hotel staff was nowhere to be found to help resolve the problem.  Signs for covid restrictions were everywhere but then they weren't enforced at all.
50,Love this place. Employees are great and friendly. Food is amazing at the Pantry. Sportsbook was nice and spacious. Only thing is that I wish security would make sure all guests wear mask properly....
50,Great location and room was sparkling clean. Front service was fast and friendly. I had a Complimentary stay the 1st night and switched to my main suite that I booked for the remainder of my stay. They made it real easy to switch without having to go to front with all my luggage
30,Nice property with a good filtration system (not smokey). Friendly staff and great pool! If you are choosing between standard rooms and Resort rooms there is honestly not a big difference in quality so I would save yourself the money and just go standard since no real upgrades justify the cost.
40,Great location in the middle of the strip. Clean fun. Rooms are a bit outdated but are clean enough. Restaurants and casino are great. The shows were just starting up again but we were not able to fit into trip.
50,The Mirage is a wonderful hotel. It is a great location on the Strip. The beds are very comfortable. The pool is my absolute favorite beautiful landscaping with waterfalls. Friendly accommodating staff.
50,Great place to stay on the strip - wonderful rooms  Great location; staff are friendly; check in through phone which saves a lot of time in the check in process. Digital key for the room and elevators which made me happier to be staying here during covid times
50,The MGM phone app has easy check in and check out features. It also acts as your room key so you go straight to your room and skip the front desk. Absolutely fabulous and I highly recommend playing My Vegas slots on your phone or on Facebook to win and redeem free rooms like I did. Thanks My Vegas Slots
20,After being closed such a long time one would think the time could have been used to work on some updates and repairs. Bathroom in room was disgraceful. Leaky shower head and mold of all things in the cracks around the tub. Sad to see what this hotel has become. Spa area needs work too. Having the men be escorted thru the women’s area is unacceptable. If nothing else Showers and lockers need to be made available. Take a lesson from canyon ranch.
40,Seems like a great location in the strip; it’s next to some of the best hotels & restaurants. The mask rules are strict but hopefully that will change soon. The poker tables have been fun too hopefully I win some money!
50,We had a great stay with our family! The hotel was easy to navigate and convenient. Pool is beautiful and rooms are clean! We would definitely recommend and come back! Prices were awesome too. Plenty of elevators
30,Strip view with looking at mostly parking lots and roof top vents. It gets better at night when things light up. Best thing is it's almost in the center on the strip. Lots of things to do and see north or south.
30,My experience at the Mirage was average. So average in fact that I don't have much to say. Perhaps COVID measures had something to do with it but I didn't feel the connection that usually compels me to go back. I had no contact nor conversation with any of the staff so neutral there. The Casino wasn't bad but not my favorite. The room had a view of a rooftop and Trump tower across the strip. Positives are just about what you would expect anywhere. The room was clean quiet and comfortable. In short it wasn't bad but next time perhaps I'll try something different.
40,This is a wonderful place to stay but you if are a coffee drinker or bring food back to your place you will have to pay for these items. Never had to do this before which I fined unacceptable and they should rethink.
50,YOU CAN COUNT ON THE MIRAGE!! This Hotel is truly consistent in dishing out pleasant vibes and exceptional customer service. The facilities were super clean sanitized and the maintenance staff were constantly sanitizing the gaming machines! My Suite experience was AMAZING!! My in room dining experience was TOP NOTCH! Housekeeping was EXCELLENT! With everything that’s happening today from COVID etc. it is refreshing and hopeful to have such an amazing experience at your travel destination. THANK YOU “MIRAGE”!
50,My husband and I stayed here for a birthday party. This hotel had multiple restaurants bars stores pools & even the spa were open. We took advantage of everything. We arrived on a Thursday which was perfect b/c they were completely closed on Tuesdays & Wednesdays. Everyone wore mask & we felt safe. The rooms were clean & the service was superb. Shot out to the front desk worker Derrick his customer service was beyond exceptional. He gave us the run down on what’s open what’s worth visiting & even up graded our room to a Penthouse for a reasonable rate. I would highly recommend this hotel the location amenities & staff is worth me staying here again.
30,The room and hotel were beautiful. However there is no complementary coffe  no microwave and the refrigerator is stocked with extremely overly priced items. If you want to use the refrigerator you have to pay $50/day!
40,The end of the hallway and we were there for four days so it was a lot of walking and we were tired and sore. Other than that it was great. Lost a lot of money. Lol .. The ladies and housekeeping are very friendly and were very nice and helpful. I appreciated that
50,This is by far the Best Venue for March Madness in Vegas. Over the past 20 years I've stayed at every hotel on the Strip but this is the Diamond in the Rough. Wanting a chill vibe at the sports book and easy access to a thrilling gaming floor? Wanting to return to every food venue you haunt at your resort the next night? Want rooms that are modern and clean and make great remote offices for work? Wanting to swim at the best designed pool on the Strip? Wanting a fun crowd? Well... STAY HERE and be sure to watch the nightly Volcano Show!
50,From the time we stepped out of the Uber we felt like we were in good hands. The nicest concierge came to load our belongings onto a cart. Which we then were given a slip to call once we arrived to our rooms to have our bags brought up. The hotel staff and rooms were great. The stay surpassed my expectations!
10,See other comments . Old  run down dirty bathroom was deplorable. A once classy and prestigious hotel dwindled to a Las Vegas casualty. I forgot about getting a taxi . Taxis were no where to be found
50,Everything about this resort was amazing! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful! The hotel was beautiful clean and felt very safe. My room was very comfortable perfect temperature cozy bed. I appreciated the complimentary mask & hand sanitizer.
40,Love our stays at the Mirage however my last stay(March 2021) the shower head in our room was literally trickling water and the bathroom sink took forever to drain! Called the front desk 3 times and was told someone was coming each time only for nobody to show up!
30,Bed was hard poor wifi no mini bar basic restaurant prices were ridiculous lost our table after being put on a waiting list for over an hour. Text came trough immediately checked back within about 3 minutes since poor wifi text was received late told we would have to start our wait all over again. FURIOUS
30,"""Hotel (ripe-off) Fee"" was $175 additional!! We went March 19th - 4 days after Vegas went to 50% and the beginning of March Madness. Everyone had AMPLE notice that these two events were coming. Yet only place to get coffee in the morning inside the restaurant is a Starbucks and expect a 30+ minute wait. Other coffee places are closed. Pool closes at 5 pm ridiculous when it's still sunny and warm out. The whole hotel reeks of weed. Steak restaurant is closed - why? Room was not cleaned because they had a lot of checkouts (why wasn't this planned for? don't reservations give a hotel a clue how many people are coming and going??) volcano which is supposed to be on the hour often didn't go off at all cigar bar was $150 a person just to sit outside!! That doesn't even count the price of any cigar! Dolphin and ""secret garden"" are $40 - total rip off. All of Vegas has jacked up their prices - I think they are trying to make up for the money lost for COVID but come on they rack in millions every month. Whole city is skanky weed filled nasty and trashy. Ugh stay away!"
20,The hotel was very crowded and they still closed several restaurants. The only option for coffee was Starbucks and I waited 50 min one day and 25 another. Rhumbar charged a $150 cover fee to get in (used to be free). Prices were elevated from my previous trip there. Weed smell everywhere. Room service too busy one day to clean the room. The pool closed at 5PM despite a full crowd (and it wasn't to sanitize as I watched).
40,Love the location. Easy to get in and out of. Needs more restaurants open. It is getting busier again so more staff and slot machines are needed. Staff is friendly but not always easy to get a drink while playing.
30,The Mirage needs to start to remodel. I have been coming to the Mirage every March Madness for 20 years and the hotel is average. They have great location but you still feel like the hotel is outdated. The guest rooms have not changed for 15 years and I still think they have the same carpet in the hallways. They really need to change the mattress out every once in a while. If you are looking for a high end hotel this is not the place. If you want to pay prices like a high end hotel and sleep like you are at a motel I would suggest the Mirage. I won’t be coming back until they start updated the rooms and hotel. This is ridiculous to keep seeing the same crap every year.
50,It was nice to see activity in Vegas and The Mirage did a great job being prepared for a busy March Madness weekend. The only thing that I was hoping for but understand with the COVID rules that more restaurants would have been opened.
30,After a long day of drinking and gambling we went back to our room and found blood on our pillow cases and dirty sheets. Other than that room was fine. Had a dolphin view and great water pressure. No microwave and no coffee pot. We paid extra for a nicer room but I would save your money and get the cheaper room besides a basic bath tub no extra amenities.
10,There is almost zero chance that I will be staying or recommending someone else to stay at the mirage. We got a Hospitality Suite and it had a terrible odor throughout our stay. On the next to last day of the stay we had actual brown water leaking into our room that appeared to be the cause of the odor from our entire trip. We contacted the front desk and after having to still stay in our disgusting room for another 3 hours were moved to the Suite on the floor above. When we arrived in the new room which we were told had just been cleaned the odor was somehow even worse. We again had to contact the front desk. They moved us to another Suite on the 14th floor. This suite did not have the terrible odor so that was a relief. However the lack of caring and urgency from the staff was amazing to me. I feel that when a guest calls in that actual colored water that has an odor is leaking into a suite there would be a much higher level of caring. We were told that resort fees would be removed from our bill although the final receipts that I received did not have any credits for them. I will now have to contact the resort yet again to try and get the credits. I cannot imagine a scenario that our group will be booking our yearly trip at the Mirage or any other MGM resort after this ridiculous display of customer service.
10,Customer for over 20 years. Room was bad. Casino was bad. Customer service was bad. No help from Casino Hosts. Security was untruthful and then accused me of lying. BetMGM was not helpful when needing help with 3rd Party intermediary.
50,Always clean inviting great location on the strip. Stores and restaurants nearby. Starbucks and 24 hours Snacks cafe. Enjoy our stay every time we visit. Friendly and inviting stuff. Will recommend to family and friends. thank you!
50,Great location to stay on the strip. Really convenient. Rooms are a good size. The service was great from the check in to housekeeping to the check out. Environment was very friendly and seen lots of family. It has a pool. And it has a dolphin show.
50,Loved my time staying at the mirage! Beds were comfy! Perfect location to walk to other locations. One of my favorite pools in Vegas! I wish they still had a club at the hotel sad that they closed 1 oak.
10,The air conditioner in the room did not cool properly the tub would back up every time a shower was taken the mini bar door would not open and the maid service neglected to clean our room the third day. Last time I stay at this property.
40,Went to Vegas as a last minute family trip. We chose the mirage for the dolphins tigers and pool. The only negative was the pool was still very cold and was not fun at all. But everything else was great. I loved the mobile check in and check out process and I loved avoiding the desk and lines completely.
30,Location and pool are the best assets of this hotel. The rooms are older and outdated but decent overall minus a few details. Our TV was large but it was nonfunctional (I guess they don’t expect you to spend time in the room?). The shower head is very low and appears to be made for people who are 4 ft 6 inches or under. Casino didn’t actually have a poker room as it says on their website. Location is very good as it is right by the Venetian and Cesar’s palace. Pool was refreshing and well shielded from the wind. Bed in the room was comfortable. Overall if you’re just looking for a decent place to sleep between gambling and are short this would be an excellent hotel for you.
20,The staff was friendly however the room was dirty. There was what appeared to be small bloodstains on the foot of the bedspread. There was also stain all over the ceiling. Was very disappointed in the rate versus quality.
50,Please read:  I can’t explain the admiration I have for the mirage because their are very nice 5star hotels I have free Comp nights too but you can’t replace customer service. From the servers at Otoro to hostess at Costa but it starts from the top to bottom. My host Mr W.Haddock is genuinely my friend a man I respect and has always looked out for me. I am a 7* at Ceasers / platinum at Mlife so I can stay anywhere on the strip. I will give you 2 examples I got both my 2ndcovid shots the day of my flight. I have been feeling side effects like fatigue chills headache pain etc. he sincerely worried told me to relax I didn’t need to play (which is different from what all my other hosts do) 2nd when I lost my phone Costa closes at 10pm mind you she was running around the casino with me from 1030 to 12 and helped me retrieve my phone. Some people in this industry are just downright kind and caring human beings this makes me want to always come and stay at the mirage and play their when I’m out here: I’ve stayed at every property but NY Excalibur and cosmo I keep coming back to the mirage. I don’t want to throw shade at other hosts because their doing their job but I guess the nicest way to put it is the mirage goes above and beyond to create an excellent and understanding experience for their customer’s. Thank you 🙏
20,Our room was given away forcing us to try and squeeze 4 people on a king bed and a twin size rollaway bed. The only reason we didn’t leave was because after a 6 hour drive we were tired and all rooms on the strip were full due to March madness
20,Incredibly long walk from rooms to Strip. Inexperienced front desk caused billing errors that took days to correctly fix. Housekeeping skipped a day out of nowhere then tried to enter our room no less than 12 times from 8-10am last morning of trip. Dated worn room with tiny old bathroom compared to ANYWHERE else on Strip. Disappointing overall.
20,Needs to be updated. Not clean. Good location right on the strip near the middle. Self parking was easy. Floors are run down and out of date. Pool was ok although was super cold so I don’t think they should advertise as heated. No one was in the water.
40,The mirage is always clean with plenty of eateries nice pool area and plenty of games. The rooms are a little dated (but very clean) and the beds that we always raved about the comfort of were not the same this stay. Once all the stores events and restaurants are fully functioning it will be really great. Our stay over March madness and it was really packed and was great to see all the activity again. This hotel is in a great location to walk to many other attractions and casino's.  We love the Mirage and will be back!
10,As a Mlife Platinum card holder I am super disappointed with MGM and the Mirage this past weekend. Long lines not enough staff. Needed to plan way better. Will be hard to go back. Total lack of organization
10,Against our better judgement to meet family and despite confirming all these safety measures the hotel advertised there was nothing in place. Hotel over crowded trash everywhere minimum staff dirty room. We bounced and went to Mandalay where they have hand washing station crown control you see staff sanitizing and a really clean room. Traveling right now is a bad idea.
50,We really enjoyed our stay our young daughters enjoyed the nightly volcano show from the window. The Pantry had a great breakfast and the pool water was tempered but the cool wind made it challenging to use but the hotel stay was still enjoyable!
30,The bathrooms are very small I know this is an older hotel however upgrades are needed! The pool is gorgeous and the casino is great! The beds were hard and the rooms were smelly. It’s a classic hotel and I’m glad I tried it out but won’t be staying here again.
40,Safe clean and the staff was so friendly and helpful I recommend this hotel plus is kids friendly as well and on every entrance they have a face mask plus to wash your hands. I recommend this hotel.
50,Everything was wonderful. I truly enjoyed myself and the night light energy was extremely enjoyable. The staff’s service was beyond excellent and I had a blast with the slot machine. I will be Back really soon.
50,Our family enjoyed our week long stay at The Mirage. The hotel was very clean and the rooms were comfortable. We had a spectacular view of Vegas without the loud noise from traffic that we experienced at another well known hotel on the strip. Our 7 year old granddaughter was thrilled to watch the volcano erupt each night from our window. The landscaping at The Mirage is absolutely stunning. We will definitely stay here on future visits.
10,We have traveled to Vegas for years and stayed at Mirage dozens of times. The hotel is dated now housekeeping service non existent pool a cattle call with dozens dropping a towel and a book to reserve a chair and leaving the pool area. Extremely limited food service one venue open 7 am to 3 pm the other open at 4. Tried to get a mobile order sandwich after waiting 30 minutes no food they lost the order. Went to pool ordered a sandwich - 2 hours later no food. Playing at slots this am ordered a mimosa guess what the “resort” is out of champagne here’s a vodka and oj instead.?Our room here was comped would not stay here again even with comped rooms and resort credit unless they revamp things- Wynn is a true resort and will continue to book our stays there
30,The staff is always great when things are perfect. I had an issue outside the normal operations and they seemed very dismissive and not very helpful. Ultimately for every negative there is a positive. The positive attitude of the staff during the nonsense of mask wearing was beyond expectations.
20,Stayed here for our 3-day annual company conference which is normally held at the Cosmopolitan. Nice lobby and pool area good selection of coffee shops and restaurants conference food was good and organisation of the conference by the hotel team was slick. But....    My hotel room was dirty there were blood splashes on the side of the bath surround and a couple of the floor tiles were cracked the waste bin had sticky residue at the bottom bedside tables had a layer of dust the bedding was creased and looked like they hadn't been changed from the previous occupant. As our company had filled the entire hotel accommodation there were no other rooms available. Despite the room being re-cleaned and new bedding by house-keeping team - they missed the blood splashes on the bath surround which was the worst thing that they could have missed. It felt dirty every time that I went in the room. I couldn't wait to leave the hotel and would never recommend it.
10,Time for a major overhaul at Mirage. The place needs to be gutted. Once the jewel of the strip the place is dated and the vibe is equally as stale. I have stayed there 2 times a year for many years. I have been saying for years how they need a major gut job. But now it is not just the decor. The staff is not friendly the dealers are dinosaurs the casino is the most boring on or off the strip. You want to be lulled to sleep at the tables go play at mirage. I am just saying so many newer places with better vibes. You want to come to vegas to age out and die Mirage is the place. It is too bad. Great location and it was my long time favorite. Hope someone comes in and brings it back to life.
20,Remember to add $40 /night on whatever theirs (and every other mgm property in Vegas) advertises. I don't object to the fee. I think it's duplicitous to tack it on at the end.    The standard rooms are so whatever. There's no coffee in the room and getting coffee from the hotel in the morning involves either waiting on hold for 20 minutes before room service actually takes your order. Or you have to walk 1/4 mile across the hotel (not joking if your room is at the end of a hallway) to get Starbucks.    I've lived in Vegas a good portion of my life and have stayed in most of the hotels for personal & work trips and I would never stay here again. You're better off doing a Stations hotel or at one is the nicer fremont hotels.
40,Satisfied with the property. Good vibe in the hotel lobby and on the casino floor accessible shops and light gaming options. Excellent and friendly staff. The food at the cafe was below average at best but our options were limited because of pandemic. Overall good experience
50,This was an awesome experience without any of the hassles experienced at other properties along the strip. We will without a doubt stay here every time we visit!! Every staff member was pleasant and the atmosphere was calm and relaxing for the family. Thank you!
50,I have not been to Las Vegas since my last trip in 2001 when I stayed at Mandalay Bay which was very nice. This trip I stayed at the Mirage and I was impressed with every aspect of this property from its beauty and uniqueness to its friendly staff and comfortable suites. I had a wonderful time and although I did not walk away a jackpot winner I found the payoffs on the slots to be often enough to make me smile with great pleasure. Thank you for it all!
30,Most restaurants and bars closed. Very short staffed in all areas. Bell staff is very short staffed and it takes too much time to get service. Had an early morning flight which I almost missed because there were no taxis. No staff on duty to help with calling taxi companies.
50,Took my kids we had a penthouse everything was nice and clean. We had no issues and staff are so polite. Pool area was great kids had a blast. Definitely would recommend this hotel much better than Luxor
50,We decided to take a road trip for our anniversary this year. We decided to stay at the Maroge and booked a suite through our vacation club. What we got was above expectations! The room was a 1200 square-foot suite C-54. The entire staff was great.
10,This is the fifth hotel I’ve stayed at in Vegas unfortunately it was the worst. The bed is very uncomfortable you can hear every single little noise in surrounding rooms and the hallways. It has a motel 6 kind of vibe. I went with my boyfriend he got two nights and I got one. We were charged two different “incidental” amounts. With no real explanation. I do not recommend staying here.
50,Great Hotel. Hospitality suite was very nice the master bathroom is in need of a renovation. Great selection of new slots. Snacks and Pantry had great food.Slot area was clean and sanitized. Would definitely go back
20,"Loud Neighboring ""Room Parties"" till 4am or so Don't book here if You want to get ANY sleep at night... Boom - Boom - Boom BASE Music and people Yelling from multiple rooms (all night long). But I guess this is the type of clientele that Vegas wants now!"
30,Hotel has seen better days. Dirty bathroom floor. Was never cleaned while we stayed. A tooth floss pick was left on the floor when we arrived. Stains everywhere. The check-in staff seemed eager to get you in...and move you out of the way. The M-life program is unrealistic.
10,Main pool closed during week. You pay same resort fee. Hot tub closed. Pool opens at 10. Check out time 11. Fridge too full of them trying to sell stuff. Rooms were clean. Shower had good pressure. Long line to check in. Slow staff.
50,Great first stay for my girlfriend and I. Our room wasn’t quite ready by 3pm but the staff took care of us.    We did feel that they rushed to get our room ready a little bit but they fixed any issues we came across.
30,No coffee makers in rooms no fridge inside the room only with 75$ fee per day beds not that comfortable the shower was small and water wouldn’t drain fast enoughchecked out early and still got charged full stay.
10,At check in they said pool is open but the main (fun pool) was closed. Someone said they only open it on weekend. But why??? I paid the same 40 resort fee as someone during the weekend and I get less??? The pool that was open was a small little pool away from the falls in a time of COVID! Space us out! Hot tub was closed. Rooms were okay but no coffee utensils microwave no space in fridge.
40,Atmosphere is nice hotel has a good elevator system to keep out rubble. Other than that the fridge in hotel is nonexistent it’s one of those old fashioned mini bar and u get charged for using it or 35 for one to go in the room. That is horrible in my opinion and enough to warrant a stay elsewhere next time. Customer service is great
50,This trip was for my wedding and the room was perfect. The salon was a lifesaver since my hair got butchered by a different salon the day prior. They were amazing. The concierge was perfect in giving suggestions for experiences and advice to help save money. The housekeeping was very thorough and very creative with how they made the beds with my kids stuffed animals. My kids were even excited. The volcano was amazing and the view was perfect.
50,Overboard on the mask stuff but other than that we had excellent service. Won quite a bit on slots and table games. I recommend the tables mostly. Had some really interesting dealers. Very patient and knowledgeable
20,The penthouse suite is showing some wear. Hot water was lukewarm and would run could before a five minute shower was finished. Jetted tub was not functioning the jets worked and then didn’t work. The bar fridge door didn’t close right. The ice in the bin melted and froze into a solid block. In the bar area the was a high pitched electrical buzzing sound that made it impossible to be in the area.
40,They had friendly staff. The room wasn’t worth the money. Also you shouldn’t have to walk from check in clear across the Casino to get to your hotel room. The pool was a disappointment because only part of it was open. Very sad that the hot tub was closed.
10,Terrible service we did make reservations and pay for deposit for our room selection but they give us the different one And act like they don’t do anything. They don’t even sorry about the service. So lying on customer
30,Celebrating my birthday with family and friends. We had a total of 12 couples 6 rooms reserved had problems with 2 of the rooms only. One our had to be reassigned but not close by not even on same floor so this did throw us off a little. Other than that all good.
50,This is the third time I have chosen the Mirage. It is a perfect location on the strip. If you have a show to see at another hotel or just want to sightsee it is more than likely it is within walking distance or a short drive away. If you are a shopper the large mall is within walking distance. The dolphin and tiger habitat is at the Mirage which was our favorite part of the trip. If we had had time we would have paid to see the dolphins again. I will definitely choose this hotel again and not even shop around for a different one.
50,Great place to stay happy employees everything was clean. One can tell they took this COVID mess seriously. Loved the dolphins tigers and the food of course. Check in and out is super easy with the MGM app. 🙂😎
50,Great staff; No problems whatsoever during our stay. Crowd for the most part was decent except for the occasional kids who can’t handle their liquor.  Not at the mirage but make sure you try The Crack Shack at their sister property- Park MGM. Cheers!
30,No shows available and no vouchers. Would have been nice to get some vouchers since there were no shows at the mirage.. Also would have liked the gym to be open earlier along with the coffee shops since no coffee maker in the room.
10,We had to change the room twice. The first time we were given a room that was not ready as it appeared still occupied upon entry dirty and full of alcohol bottles. Even a face mask was left on a table.  The second room was changed when the TV would not work. After the house engineer arrived approximately 1.5 hours after the issue was reported he started to pull out the wooden wall TV and cables all over the place just to finally said that some box is missing and that he would need to pull the cable from the floor below which is a 2 persons job. He spent 30 minutes in a room and when he left he said he would come back soon - he never came back and we finally canceled the service.  I called the front desk who told me they can change the room in the morning which we ended up doing.  Kudos to front desk manager Alexander who gave us The Mirage Suite as an upgrade and waived the resort fee (which still showed on the final folio so I had to deal with the front desk about it upon check-out). The suite was nice but due to the proximity to the elevator it was extremely noisy and you could hear elevators noise all night long.  All-in-all I spent 2-3 hours dealing with the property issues.  Also lots of front desk staff with an attitude!
20,Good things first. I love the jungle like check in area and the pool. The hotel staff was very nice / pleasant and helpful. Location is pretty great.    Negatives...  Our room was nicely styled but not very clean noises from hallway where very loud... this is Vegas.... Doors slamming all night are to be expected but it seemed like it was worse than normal. Bathroom sink was dirty with hard crusty dirt and hair. Very gross. I cleaned it myself as we didn’t feel like making a big deal. Bed was ok but after 4 nights killed my back it was probably due for a replacement.    Restaurant (snacks/the still) staff was rude which was weird because usually we have good service in Vegas other restaurants during this trip where great.    The casino was one of the smelliest/smokiest on the strip and we literally went through everything from the encore to Mandalay Bay.    This stay wasn’t horrible but you can do better for the same price and a lot better if you spend a little more.
40,Overall everything was great. Price we paid was a little high considering that so much was still closed. Many of the dining was still on abbreviated hours. Bar Staff inside the casino is def short. Very hard to find servers walking around. 1/2 of restaurants are still closed due to covid. We arrived late on a Thursday night 10:30pm and there were NO options for food ANYWHERE on site. Just surprising for Vegas however understandable post covid until everything fully recovers.
50,Very great staff very helpful and great attitude room service was super easy I’m definitely coming back the wife was extremely happy with view from our D- floor I loved the shade all electric very high end
40,"I'd recommend the Mirage for anyone who wants to ""ball on a budget"". You get all the amenities of Ceasars palace (next door) for a fraction of the cost. The Mirage is a great resort hotel right in the middle of the strip with everything you need within walking distance."
50,Hotel was awesome everyone very friendly. Loved the location a lot of things to do and see we would definitely stay there again. Had a lot of fun playing the slots. Hopefully we will be back again later this year
50,Great stay as expected. Wish restaurants had different operating hours but due to the pandemic a lot of places were restricted. But Mirage as always proved their place and was exceptional as always.
30,After nearly a year of the pandemic our family needed a quick getaway that allowed us to do things outdoors. The Mirage was probably the only hotel that had their heated pool open when we were going to visit so we booked our stay with them.    The check in process wasn’t too terrible. It probably helped that we arrived on a Thursday evening. There was a line of about 10 groups; some of them were socially distant. You could use their mobile check in via their app but the app itself wasn’t very good.    We wanted a room that allowed us to see the volcano show. If you are noise and light sensitive I would not recommend a room like this. The volcano show happens every hour on the hour beginning at 7 pm and goes until 10 pm. If you aren’t in the room during that time then it shouldn’t bother you.    The room itself was rather dated. The fixtures inside the bathroom weren’t functioning properly. For example the handles for the sink and the shower were finicky - you had to overturn the the shower handle to get the water to get hot. So if you are traveling with children you have to be hyper vigilant so that your children don’t get burned. If you are traveling with children there is very little water pressure in the shower head and there is no handheld shower head so bath time is challenging.    The housekeepers also don’t like to replenish the bath products. So I recommend bringing your own. They provide bar soap shampoo conditioner and lotion. None of the products are very good. So ladies you are better off bringing your own products.    The pool area was better big. They had a waterfall area that was fun. Wait until later in the day to go under the water so that the water has time to warm up. The heated pool wasn’t as heated as advertised though. The lifeguards said that if you want to be maskless you needed to be in the water waist deep.    For those who need their coffee be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes for it. There is a Starbucks in the hotel. Many of the restaurants in the hotel weren’t always open so check ahead.    For those that are wondering if people in Las Vegas were staying socially distant the short answer is no. There are some who are trying to do that but many people aren’t. So if you are risk adverse Vegas is not for you.    If you have kids the Secret Garden on the property was good. You can see the white tigers that were a part of the old show. The dolphins in the habitat were cool.    All in all if you are looking for a place to stay in the strip The Mirage is an okay place. Just don’t walk onto the property with high expectations and it will be fine.
30,The location is great but we had issues with our room. In their defense we did not contact management but the smell didn’t say much for the general upkeep of the rooms. We noticed water damage in the hallway which had yet to be repaired. The public areas are well kept.
50,We had a fantastic stay at the Mirage! Such a great place for an weekend full of adult fun! We especially enjoyed the relaxing lounge that was close to the casino and the guest towers. We would definitely stay here again!
50,I love everything about the mirage. Best machines hands down. Every time I go to the mirage I win 1000 plus. EVERY TIME! The pool there is amazing and the rooms are the best. They are so comfortable. Everything about the mirage is amazing and that’s why I will not stay at another hotel. Mirage for life!!!!
40,For going during the pandemic it was overall a great trip. Celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary. I was sad the pool truly is not heated when told by several people it was when I booked. The staff was fabulous.
30,I've always wanted to stay here but sadly it did not meet my expectations. My room was not cleaned properly or at all!! There was hair in my sink I spoke to management who assured me it would be taken care of and offered to remove resort fees from my bill! Well when I came back 4 hours later the hair was still there! I called and spoke with Kyle who apologized and told me it would be taken care of and offered me a $50 room credit. He said they were behind so it would be a while before they get up there! After waiting 45 mins housekeeping came left my door wide open while I was in there half-dressed and proceeded to clean! The way she cleaned my room let me know it had not been touched which really put a bad taste in my mouth! I didn't bother to call management again because at this point I decided I just would not stay there again!!
50,The room was very nice everyone was very nice and we enjoyed our stay. The mirage is in a great spot in walking distance to where you need to go and the volcano show was my favorite. I would recommend this place to family and friends
10,Could hear everything on the bedroom next to mine even the alarm clock. The bathroom was super small and the bed was making noises. The location is great but didn’t like the rooms. The staff is not friendly.
50,Right in the heart of the strip a great location. The room was very clean and the staff cleaned it daily for me as well. The casino was great as well. Hope restaurants open soon would have liked more choices. Only downside was too many kids and that isn't the casinos fault. Great trip can't wait to get back.
20,Mirage is not what it used to be anymore. The restaurants' staff are a bit rude and the food often comes out lukewarm or even cold. This isn't just one restaurant- it was several. The table dealers seem tired and unfriendly most likely because they aren't getting ripped out which leads to the next comment. Table games and slots seem tighter than ever- I understand that it's a business but it all goes so fast. It's almost as if they don't even pretend to give you a chance. The entertainment value is just not worth it anymore. Last but not least everytime we left to head outside there were always people smoking marijuana with blatant disregard for others. I don't have a problem with it but I just don't like having it blown in my face when I'm outside.    It's almost as MGM is just giving up on that location since it is surrounded by Harrah's properties. Sadly we will not be going back. 2 stars because I have been going there for 15 years so a part of me still loves the place.
40,Great location on the Strip. I was upgraded to a tower deluxe room which may bias my positive review. Room was comfortable and express elevator to the 24/25th floors was helpful. Easy and efficient check in when arriving on a late Saturday afternoon. Free parking in multistory garage next door. I was able to get a great rate during these Covid times. Not giving it the 5 rating as I'm comparing it to Caesar's where I stayed last October. The suite that I had there also for a great rate was a far superior room.
40,I like everything about this casino but the hotel’s beds! I thought the beds were to hard from my comfort. The beds were really firm little too firm for me. I like the location. I like the casino layout.
30,The hotel was ok bathroom was dated with peeling caulk and cracked tiles. When we entered the room the kids got excited about the candy that was placed strategically right in front of us. They opened and started eating. Little one opened chips and I grabbed water. Big mistake. Each item is 18 dollars. But oh well we opened it we will pay for it. What I did not expect to pay for is the minibar items that we did not eat or drink. On top of 4 items we actually ate I was charged for 3 more. When examining the minibar noticed that few slots were empty without drinks but I though they knew how many they have in there. But I am assuming I was charged for the items missing from the fridge even though it was not there when we arrived. Please make sure to give a quick look over and mention any missing items in your minibar to your front desk right away to have a proof that you were not the one who took them. Got bill next day almost 160. NO help from Mirage. Disputing amount with my bank now. Hope to get money back.
30,We tried so many times to get food and coffee but everything had such a long line. It was just easier to find food and coffee away from this place. The staff and rooms were nice (except the bathrooms were so small only one at a time smaller than some of the old Fremont Street hotel bathrooms) we just got tired of having to leave to eat.
30,Rooms and casino were clean and nice. Issues were there are not enough outlets or working USB ports in the rooms. Also the selection for places to eat late were limited. You had to walk across the street which is easier said than done after drinking all evening. :)
50,"First time I have stayed on the strip hada great visit. The Mirage is really nice and the location is convenient. Loved the clean and beautiful room. Services were great and the service in the casino was unsurpassed. I would recommend this resort to anyone. I come to gamble and that is about it so the ""resort fee"" is a bunch of horse poop especially when many services are unavailable. Just charge a room fee and stope with the one offs....... I cant believe I have to type at lease 200 words at this point I am typing random words so that I can submit this stupid thing."
10,My hotel room at The Mirage didn’t have hot water for 24+ hours which isn’t ideal when you’ve spent the day at the pool and need to clean up for dinner. Instead of offering a room change the concierge (Andy) offered $75.00 in food and beverage comps. These comps were never applied to my account.    This EXACT same thing happened at The Luxor during my last stay except there was no water & I had to change rooms without any comps or incentives. I will not be staying with MGM in the future; the staff is rude unhelpful & dishonest.
10,We understand that Nevada now has legal recreational use of marijuana... That is fine... To each their own... But the hallways of the motel were so inundated with the smell of burnt marijuana it literally made us sick!
50,Everyone at the Mirage was so helpful and the staff kept the area and hotel clean! The only issue we had was a slight AC issue that was not bad at all! The Mlife staff helped us out with suggestions of what to do and the front desk staff was helpful in answering all our questions and helping us get into our room quickly!
10,"It's an ""older"" feeling hotel. The elevators are a serious shlep from the garage. I guess they want you to walk through the casino but I mean come on people think about the old folks.... I hate that they don't have refrigerators for your to use lest the sensor goes off and you have to deal with getting the ""charges"" removed. And seriously even motel 6 provides coffee pots.... as I you don't get enough money from what you charge folks?!!!! Will NEVER go there or recommend this place again!"
50,The Mirage has been my favorite property since I watched the movie Pure Country in 1992 lol. But the reason it stays my favorite is because they care. It is always upgraded clean the staff is friendly and the location is absolutely perfect!
50,Great environment considering I went during a pandemic. Lots of places to eat gamble and just enjoy a relaxing weekend. The mobile check in was easy and the check out was without hassle. Definitely recommend to anyone going to Vegas.
30,Our stay was comfortable we stayed in a stay well room. When we arrived the room was musty and the purifier filter said replace filter. We contacted house keeping and they sent Author from maintenance who arrived pretty quickly. He was polite and professional he quickly replaced the filter with a clean one. Pool was clean and staff were polite. Plenty of staff at pool saying hi and also asking people to follow face mask requirements. We ate breakfast at the Pantry they had excellent service and breakfast it seemed that they opened up seating at the restaurant next to pantry to accommodate serving more people which was nice. Didn't have much luck getting coffee at starbucks due to long lines. Casino was ok not many servers and lines long at mlife only one employee working at the time I was in line. Overall we enjoyed our stay.
30,When first checked in the TV wasn't working so maintaince had to come and fix it. Then the shower and tub had hair in it but I didnt want to wait for another staff member to clean it so I cleaned it myself. The shower head had green rust on it like build up. I had high expectations for this place from the ratings and the way they advertise themselves. It was just disappointing from a 4 start hotel. I have stayed at the MGM my other 2 times in Vegas and never had these problems. So I thought this being another 4star resort this would be another great experince. The staff was friendly but this does not make up for the cleanliness issues. Now more than ever cleanliness should be a top priority.
40,We stayed here for a couple days on a comp. we had an 8th floor room. The room was decorated nicely. It was also large in size and furniture placement. The bathroom was small but not inconveniently so. The room had the mini bar offering. The bed was too hard for my liking however my husband liked it. The resort is beautiful with a tropical feel. The pool was lovely and large. We really loved the Secret Garden. There is a fee there but worth every penny for the tigers and dolphins. They do provide dolphin shows.service staff were all nice and professional. This is one of the cleanest hotels we’ve stayed in. I would recommend to anyone including families.
30,Got waken up both nights with other guests coming back to the room either too late or leaving too early. The automatic hinge on the door slams it shut every time.    Housekeeper does not sweep so coming back to the room with debris on the floor from previous night.
50,First trip to Vegas. Rooms were quiet and sleep great. Staff so friendly. Casino was not as smoky as I expected- good air filtration. Restaurant on site that was open was good. Rideshare readily accessible
50,Our first family vacation since Covid and it was awesome thanks to staff at the Mirage. Staff went the extra mile to make sure we were safe and had a wonderful experience during our stay here. Hotel was clean and get safe.
50,Wonderful pool area. Great location. In the middle of everything. The staff was friendly. The best part was the check in. I was able to download the app and check in. Had my digital key to my room on my app so as soon as I got there I was able to go straight to my room.
50,Stayed here several times before.. always great experience! Hotel was very clean and great staff. Good at the Pantry and Still is amazing.  Recommend hotel and remember to get your players card.  Thank you Mirage for the great time again
40,"So working in the aughts for a software company I spent a lot of time at client sites in Las Vegas. Never for the Mirage but that's where we all gravitated...it was the coolest hotel on the strip at that time. I never had a chance to stay there for work and so for my latest trip with friends I found a deal at the hotel and was so excited we all decided to stay there!    In the time of covid of course the offerings in the hotel where limited but we didn't feel too cheated (damn I miss room service!).    I stayed in a suite and it was beautiful my only complaint was that the have the ""Beatles"" advertisement overlay on the windows of the suites so it actually hindered the view. Of course we weren't there for the view.....    Overall - would I stay there again? YepI would.  So convenient to so many things on the strip and who knew there was a cable car to the TI out front now? That made the north strip even more accessible."
40,The hotel was very clean and had many Covid precautions in place. Nice welcome kit provided with masks and hand sanitizer. Places were just reopening so not everything in the hotel was open but still enjoyable. Spent some time by the pool which was nice. Room was clean and location of the hotel is great. Would stay again.
50,Beautiful hotel staff very interactive and friendly. My room was near the elevator my request very noise staff gave me a option to move I refused but greatly appreciated the opportunity.. this survey needs to be shortened
50,Loved our stay! It was nice to get out of the house and enjoy some family time. Location was clean mask were offered and the staff was GREAT! I would recommend staying here. Wish we could have stayed longer.
50,Took our son here for his 21st. Very nice hotel. Good food and decent gaming options. Nice selection of shopping. Will be nice when the shows can open back up. Also the Beatles store should be open like the rest of the retail establishments...that was the only disappointment. Great central location on the strip.
50,The Mirage is in the top 5 hotels for me to stay at. It is very clean and a great value. I have stayed at several Las Vegas hotels and the Mirage is always one of my favorites. I stayed here with my girlfriend for a weekend getaway. It has a great center strip location.
20,I had a run in with a few very rude employees that ruined my whole trip. The food at the Pantry was awful stuff and spent over 150$. The Still had great food and the chef even helped carry out food up going out of her way she was amazing and thankful she cooked some awesome food that was worth the 160$ spent do not eat at The Pantry you will be disappointed any fast food tops their food.
30,inconvenient hotel to stay in. refrigerator in the room can not be used by paying guests for fear of being charged $50. to get a portable refrigerator in your is an additional $35 per day. kind of expensive. there was one ice machine per floor by the elevator. the machine took 20 minutes when making ice which was empty toward the evening pretty much everyday. When you are all the way at the far end of one of the hallways it took a minute to go to and from multiple times to see if you could get ice. mobile check in was awesome got our room before the 3pm check in time! no in room coffee at all unless you want a large container of coffee from room service when you drink one cup that was a waste and expensive. had to go all the way through the casino to the far side to the starbucks for coffee. not sure if you could get it from The Pantry downstairs main floor. the hotel is centrally located on the strip.
50,I loved the atmosphere. The room was very nice and the location was perfect. We were able to share keys get a early check in and not have to even see or speak to anyone at the front desk it was the most COVID friendly check in I have experienced since the start of the pandemic.
50,The room was spacious and very comfortable. Also had all the amenities; mini bar was well stocked. Although the room overlooked a roof top we still had a great view of the strip. Made it easier to plan our walking route. Great Trip!
50,Great location. Middle of the strip. Uber is around $12 everywhere you went (Fremont or Mandalay Bay). Great comps. White Castle across the street. Animal habitat has baby dolphins right now. Friendly staff.
50,You will get nothing but the best at the Mirage. They cater tti ALL needs and provide more than professional service but Royal quality experience. Also great rates as well. I never mind spending money here because they always reward me in points or comped rooms or even free play. Ive never stayed at any other hotel since i first came to Vegas because ive loved the service that i got here. I'm loyal to the experience that i get and will never switch. Thank you guys for always going the extra mile to provide more than exceptional service. Oh and this stay was my Honeymoon :-)
50,Staff were awesome . Hotel was very clean . The food was amazing . We truly enjoyed ourselves and would recommend the Mirage for your family vacation  business trip or any special event you are planning .
40,During COVID so things are different. Disappointed to see so many restaurants closed or limited hours. Had to leave property to find something to eat on a day we wanted to stay in. Room decent. Blue tooth speaker was not in the room. they brought one but it didnt work.
20,This used to be a really nice place to stay. Not so much these days. I took my daughter to Vegas for her birthday. Problems started at check in. We waited forever even at nearly midnight. Finally got called up to the counter. Right as we got to the counter a man walked up from the side and started talking to the clerk. Rather than asking him to get in line as I had done and wait his turn she helped him first. The other clerks finished their check ins and even helped additional guests while I stood there waiting for this mans issues to be resolved.  When I got to my room I relaxed and went in to take a shower. Once I was undressed and in the shower I looked up to discover several very dirty and soiled (poop stained booger smeared nasty) washclothes from a prior guest hanging over the shower rod. This is during covid. Cleaning staff cant be bothered to do better than this during a pandemic? I dont expect perfection I am in vegas....it isnt a sterile environment. What I do expect is to not come face to face with someone elses feces stained washclothes in the shower.  The neighboring room was basically hotboxing all weekend. Smoke coming in under the door of my non smoking room our entire stay. My luggage is so full of the smell of weed that I can not get it out. We had to sleep with the window open and the fan running on the AC unit to try to keep the room clear. All of my clothing and luggage and anything else that entered the room reeks of weed. We took a nap in the car one day to avoid going back up to the room and dealing with it.  The mobile checkout didnt work the checkout screens in the lobby said my reservation could not be found. So I had to stand in line again. The clerk was rude on checkout as well. Of course we were charged a huge resort fee for things we cant even use during covid. This place has gone way down hill.
30,The room smelled like mildew. I wouldn’t go back and stay there but I would go back to the steak house. The hotel it self is nice looking but the rooms need some help. I hope after COVID they update there rooms.
50,Hotel was very clean staff was great restaurants not all fully open but the k es that were were good. Bathroom door too close to the toilet the only downfall. View from my room was good as well we stayed on the Valcano view side nice show to see.
50,I usually don’t write reviews but this was perhaps the best hotel experience I’ve received. I’m enrolled in several rewards programs but every future stay in Las Vegas I’ll first seek out the MGM properties and especially The Mirage. From the staff to the amenities everything was first class!
20,2 bedroom suites and penthouses were old and outdated. Poor customer service from front desk and concierge. Wouldn't recommend staying in the 'nicer' rooms if you are actually expecting them to be 'nice'.
30,The Mirage has a nice casino and of course Love. The rooms however are really starting to show their age. On this trip in particular our room was very worn and tired looking. Didn’t feel very clean.
40,had a great time even with C19 going on and not so many people yet. hotel was beautiful won some money and room overlooked volcano. good access to the strip and security good about enforcing mask rules. many hand sanitizer stations throughout. Pantry is a good value for a light breakfast as well.
10,The line to check in was 30+ people. The hotel had 4 staff to check people in. The hotel did not accommodate the long wait to check in. The hotel charges $16 for a bottle of water! How can a basic human need be so expensive. Make the water in the rooms drinkable!
50,The Mirage is quieter cleaner and much better suited for those who don't like to party all night. Great stores and restaurants. Beautiful and comfortable rooms. Great price. Book the tower suite! It's worth it.
30,We had kids yelling and dogs barking and the head cleaning lady stood at the end of the hall and yelled at all the workers to do stuff!!! Couldn’t sleep past about 7! In Vegas you should be able to sleep late!
20,If you want to stay on the strip for a moderate price and still get an average room this is good. I like that it’s not stuck up and too fancy but it’s not ghetto like Harrahs. It wasn’t up to my expectations as a MGM property on the strip though. The hotel is pretty small the rooms are old and worn the staff was clearly not interested in being there and the food at the Pantry was just gross.
20,Beautiful hotel with common areas. Very nice and clean casino. However the room itself was horrible. The bed was uncomfortable the furniture was not in good condition and the carpets were ripped. The showerhead in the bathroom was absolutely horrible! It was definitely an average at best hotel room not what you would expect in Las Vegas. I’ve stayed in many of the other properties nearby and this was probably the worst.
50,Excellent everything great place for stay dinner and gambling great location the staff were very very friendly the front desk was very friendly and very helpful although the mask wearing could do some improvement
50,All hotel staff was polite and professional. Great hotel location easy parking great food and great casino. Love staying at this hotel and will continue to stay every chance we get to visit Las Vegas.
50,The location of this hotel is where you want to be. The shops are near by and the strip is right in front. The hotel itself is very clean and they make it easy to check in with your phone. I do recommend you get the MGM app which would have your info ready to go.
30,Rooms were good but few things weren't good like bedsheets and blankets have some kind of dirty spots on it then we had to change the room. New room was fine but bathroom had problem where bathtub was not that clean and then bathroom tap malfunctioned and water was keep flowing and was closing. I had to file a complaint and no one came soon to fix the issues so overall experience was not that great.
50,Checking was fast and easy. The front lobby was amazing! Many good restaurants to choose from. Staffing was friendly and knowledgeable! Rooms were amazing. Housekeeping was very nice and good! Customer services was excellent!
50,The Mirage is my favorite place to stay on the strip. The location is perfect and they have many options for dining. Only complaint was that the room seemed like someone had already been in there. It was a little dirty the bed had a dent as if someone had sat on it and the seal on the complimentary hand sanitizer had been torn.
50,Have stayed at several other Vegas locations this was 1st at the Mirage. Great room and view of the strip. Really good restaurants. Casino offers lots of variety and is clean. Service was good despite reduced staffing.
40,Casino is nice but the room door didn’t shut tight so it’d rattle every time a door shut in hall. Shower head terrible. Decor outdated . The digital key didn’t always work  so I had to use the old fashioned one anyway.
50,Everyone was very friendly and helpful no matter what the situation could have been. I will certainly come and stay at the Mirage as well as recommend this resort to family and friends. I really enjoyed myself in spite of COVID
50,Or stay here was amazing. Starting with our check in experience to the end of our stay it was great. Everything was clean they had hand washing stations mask at the entrances and in your rooms. Would definitely stay here and recommend you stay here as well!
50,This place really surpassed my expectations had stayed in most top hotel in Vegas and this is my favorita so far ! Will come back to it I will expect a welcome back letter or something nice as a welcome back treat ! I LOVE THE MIRAGE !!
10,I was charged for waters I did not open in my room. I asked customer service and they laughed about my concern and was extremely disrespectful. I sat for hours playing on machines and they only serviced the card tables and neglected the rest of the floor and if you asked them going up to them they shunned you away and treated you poorly.
50,Hotel was nice. Mobile check in was a breeze. We could here and smell everything in our room from our neighbors and guests walking by. That was the only down fall. More skunk than I have smelt in a long time!
50,The Mirage staff is super friendly and they are always there to help if there’s a problem. The room was clean & they provide a complimentary bag with masks hand sanitizer & basic necessities that you would need while staying during covid.
50,Great location right on the strip. Staff are very friendly and no parking fee( for the meantime). Loved the convenience of the tram connecting to Treasure Island. Casino floor average just missing more Bar Slot Machines.
20,Stood in a room with filthy bathrooms . I wish it was a memorable Valentine’s and was very disappointed in the uncleanliness of the room. Will not be coming back . We got this room through Costco but I have never had this poor of value through Costco travel
50,The staff was great housekeeping to wait staff at the pantry... Room clean and comfortable with a great location.This was my birthday weekend trip and we had the best time the entire staff went out of their way to accommodate.
50,Very friendly staff great customer service clean rooms and casino.  Restaurants had great food but a little pricey. Still worth it for the experience.  I feel they took extra precautions to keep patrons safe from Covid-19 by proper cleaning of machines and offered a lot of hand washing stations located on the casino floor.
40,Good room overall. Clean and comfy with a good quality bed to rest on. Center strip location which makes it very convenient for sightseeing. Unfortunately the pools were being worked on so i wasnt able to enjoy it
50,My stay at the hotel was perfect. Great service clean rooms and clean hotel overall. Everything was easy to access. I felt secure with the amount of security was present and my family enjoyed their stay here as well
10,My son found a pc of  Clothes next to the bed..  unsanitary and so unsafe  my kids are with me. went back to lobby and had us wait almost an hour just to clean a new room. Going back and forth with all our luggages with no help at all...I will not go back to this place at all..
40,The stay was great and the room was clean and ready when I arrived. The only problem I had was the lack of security at the elevators as before.    I did enjoy the free self parking but I was sadden about the lack of valet parking
20,Rooms were very dated and small. I asked for a view upgrade since I had 3 rooms booked and had the worst view ever. Most restaurants at the Mirage weren't open on the weekend. The casino was nice and paid out well the rooms on the other hand were not.
50,Love that girl in front desk gave a best view with out having to pay upgrade but cocktail service was not good at all she have a bad attitude and was rude even though I gave her a $20 tip.. but will be coming back soon hopefully i get more comps.
50,Our room was great! Check-in through the app was easy and fast we were able to head straight to our room once we arrived. So much better than standing in line to get a room key. We were upgraded to suite which made our stay even better. My family loved the Secret Garden the dolphins were amazing. Hotel was clean staff was constantly wiping down frequently touched areas. Would definitely stay again!
40,Property was clean staff very friendly and helpful as usual but our room was showing its age a bit. Broken wooden frame at foot of bed tub drain wouldn’t seal and there was a deep crack running through the bowl of the sink. We visit Vegas several times a year and Mirage is still one of our favorites-we will stay again.
50,This was a great Hotel to stay at my first time here. Staff were on the mask situation which was great liked seeing them tell people to put on mask including my self lol. Need to go back and check out the dolphin exhibit.
30,This was our first trip to the Mirage we have stayed at a few other resorts on the Strip. It is centrally located on the strip. It’s an older resort/hotel as long as you keep that in mind and keep the expectations inline it’s not bad. This is not a high end place but it’s relatively clean and safe.    The check in was a little bumpy but they are only open a handful of days and are doing their best with limited staff and all the Covid restrictions.    The restaurants are a little expensive but there are plenty of other options just out the door. There is also a Walgreens that sells booze and anything else you could want just across the street.    No shows open loads of restrictions on restaurants bars nightclubs. Don’t go to LV right now and expect it to be how it was pre-Covid. As long as you know what you are going for and understand why it’s not the same it’s fun.
10,I reported blood running down the side of my toilet from previous occupant. Instead of just cleaning it they told me there was no blood. They cleaned it then said there was no blood. They basically called me a liar.    My friend had a dirty tub took a picture and Mirage comped a suite. Then the suite smelled like smoke. They were comped about $200 in food. (I can’t remember the exact amount.)    Now I know better. Take a picture! But even more important the rooms are not cleaned thoroughly at the Mirage. I do not recommend. That’s too bad cause I like the location and the pool area but not worth my health.
20,bathtub was rusted still dirty and the air would not work it was too hot.the 1st time I called the person at the front desk was rude as hell and pretty much told me they couldn't do anything. this was on Saturday morning. Around 10pm Feb 13th I called again because it was too damn hot in here and than finally was like I can move you but it has to be right now. I told wth I haven't even packed to go to a new one like I dont have time for this I have plans and I'm not going all the way downstairs to get moved. He argued with me over the phone for 5 minutes and I 5old him just took some resort fees off. it was the worst customer service ever!!!
50,My husband and I absolutely love The Mirage.. we always have a great experience.. The food and staff are great and it smells amazing. Reminds me of a tropical island.. The machines are all spaced out comfortably and covid safe
50,Excellent hotel . This is by far our favorite place in Las Vegas to stay. Extra big rooms  Great food and service is impeccable. The waterfalls and pool are stunning . The casino is also nice and we usually win on the slots
50,We stayed in a Corner one bedroom suite and it was by far the best room we’ve stayed in the room view made us never wanna leave the room and it smelled amazing it had a fully stocked mini bar a full living area with a large dining room the bedroom was a perfect size with a hide away tv that came out from the bed and the bathroom was amazing 😉
10,We opted to pay the $40 fee for guaranteed early checkin at 11am only to have been told that the room was not available. About an hour wait missed our required reservations for lunch. The walls and doors were thin heard every person walking down the hallway conversation
30,Hefty resort fee. Pool was empty and supposedly there was another pool but everything was blocked off so we couldn’t locate it .... bell desk was superb very quick service. and the beds were comfortable ... great location on the strip ... long lines in the lobby at checkin and checkout times and we were not able to get the mobile app to work
30,Beautiful hotel great customer service good restaurants but room fan didn't work causing room to smell spoiled/moldy. Should have been caught before we got room. Was stuck in the room for extent of stay. By end of our 3 nights we were both coughing and not feeling the greatest.
20,While situated on prime real estate the hotel is outdated. The casino's footprint is small and is something that seems to fit a casino off the strip. Now this is only the perspective of a hotel guest who's stay there was short and discouraging. Furthermore the few key entertainment factors that drew attention and the primary reason for the stay at this resort were closed or in the meddle of some sort of reconstruction/maintenance or nonexistent. One would even say these factors were misleading or with false impressions/promotions to get guest in the door. As for as the staff not all seem to be hospitable towards the gusts. Some even seam to be bothered when asked questions in regards to M Life nor motived to resolve the issue on hand. The lack of knowledgeable staff and the neglect of upper management ability to address issues as such really reflect the lack of professionalism and the motivation to make The Mirage what it once was. Unfortunately our stay at The Mirage was an uncomfortable experience and unquestionably not what we would anticipate form an MGM resort.
50,Just too good. I would have never thought I would stay in the same hotel my parents made me. I stayed in the Suite on floor C and never expected such a beautiful view. Have to love Las Vegas to the Fullest
50,Amazing first time there saw the lava show had a great room and will go back there. Everyone was super nice from the lady at check in to the security to ! The rooms where nice and roomy and tho I did not play games I was tempted to go do so
50,Always fun to come to mirage. Good location. Staff was awesome and very friendly. Will definitely be back! Every time we have stayed at the mirage was were never disappointed. Only small pool was open but the big pool looks awesome can’t wait to come back in warmer weather.
30,Hotel was in a nice location but a lot of things in my room didn’t work and I was in the tower suite. I was in walking distance of most things. They do have an easy check in process via the mobile app.
50,Not one complaint everything was clean Covid protocol in full effect. Food drink and gambling experience was unmatched. Cannot wait to come back to the mirage. Rooms were plenty big enough amazing views all over the hotel a ton of things to do as well.
50,Friend mentioned MyVegas app in Jan. All 4 of us started playing in Jan. By the weekend of 2/5 we had a 3-day stay at the Mirage comped minus the resort fees of course. Nice rooms great staff. Yeehaw!
50,I loved the view location and services were great and the staff was very helpful. Only thing I was looking forward to that I wasn’t able to do was see the dolphins and go swimming at night because I was expecting the dolphins would be a part of the hotel experience which was paid for.
50,This is hands down the best hotel if you are looking for a sports book! Plenty of space. Very generous with drink coupons. The smell os pleasant even for a slightly older casino. The people really are friendly. I have had bad experiences with customer service at hotels like the MGM and Aria but these people are simply nice as can be!
50,Had a very good time with my other half. We enjoyed the room amenities as well as the casino. Really loved the sushi restaurant in there very upscale and food was delicious . Also enjoyed seeing the dolphins and white tigers and lions. All around great stay.
50,During these tough times pandemic everything was kept clean and sanitized. The staff was friendly and accommodating to any and every request. The rooms are very nice and clean also. The Mirage is very conveniently located on the strip
30,Too many people at the pool outside that don’t even look like they afford this place??  Weird rules of masks outside around pool. Makes no sense we have to wear masks laying out?? While we a six feet away from everyone but yet in the small pool that was open none of them had to wear a mask and half of them didn’t look like they have taking a bath for days!!! Ugh
20,This place was old and dated. Room was dingy and gross. Shower was bad so was bathroom. Service was great. I was expecting the room to be so old. The curtains didnt even close. I would never stay here again
50,Very nice property. Rooms are very comfortable. There is hand sanitizer everywhere. Wide variety of slots and table games. Social Distancing is implemented so that's very good. Employees are very nice and friendly.
50,Time to get away? Mirage is the place. Make yourself at home guestrooms featuring minibars and LED televisions. Your pillowtop bed comes with premium bedding. Wireless Internet access (surcharge) keeps you connected and cable programming is available for your entertainment. Private bathrooms with showers feature complimentary toiletries and hair dryers.  If you are thinking of bringing your pet and want to know if pets are allowed at The Mirage Hotel & Casino please read the hotel pet policy.
20,The room I reserved was not given to me I was charged 3 times for the room and housekeeping knock at 8:30 am and open the door and walked inside the room. Not a good experience. Room too small aswell
50,The property has a great location on the strip. It is beautiful inside and out. Don’t forget to make reservations to eat it’s the mandated by the governor! See you soon when shows are up and running. The staff was extremely accommodating during this busy hopefully we go back to a more normal Vegas in the upcoming months.
50,Nicely centered Resort at the Strip. Affordable room prices & Great Atmosphere. Covid protocols enforced. Highly recommended. Starbucks inside few nice restaurants. Wish the buffet was open but understandable because of Covid. Overall Great first time stay home.
50,I loved my stay here definitely favorite sports book in Vegas. I love the vibe here and they have playable games for every one. Games are always decent minimums that’s why I say something for all of us.
20,Overall the room was acceptable. It needs more accessible electrical outlets on or near the nightstands. The couch on the suite area was old and had a couple of Cigarette burns on it. The suite smelled of smoke though it was a non smoking room. It was not overwhelming but discernable. The was far to little staff to serve the amount of people in the hotel for super bowl weekend. The sportsbook computers went down for hours not allowing winning tickets to be cashed after the game.
50,Such a beautiful hotel & property. Room had an incredible view of the strip and the Volcano. Would recommend to anyone looking to be on the strip and be located in a great spot next to other amazing hotels.
50,Enjoyed the location of this hotel and really liked the views especially the volcano show at night! Resort tower king room was fantastic. It so was nice to soak in the tub after a long day! Would be great if power outlets were updated with USB ports. Only complaint was the lack of power outlets but we managed. Would stay again in a heartbeat.
50,Very comfortable bed nice hotel great location paid a little extra for early check in which was nice room over looking the volcano was very cool. Make sure you make reservations for any restaurant you want to eat at because they are required everywhere.
50,Location is perfect the Still and Pantry are the best restaurants. Perfect proximity from room to everything offered is a huge plus. Staff is friendly everything is super clean. The pool in the summer is the best of the strip
40,24 friends and family in from all over the country to enjoy super bowl weekend. We had multiple rooms on multiple floors  very clean and the mattresses were very comfortable. We will definitely stay here again.
30,Arrived to find out digital check was offered but no one knows how it works! We had room D23 don’t ever get this room unless you don’t sleep it’s right next to vending area and you can hear a constant whining noise all the time. Went into the bathroom there was a glob of hair under waste can GROSS!! Ice bucket was also never dumped from previous guest double gross!! Bed was comfortable and awesome pillows we did call staff about ice bucket and anew one was sent up.
50,We booked the volcano view and it did not disappoint! Room was clean bed is so comfortable. We loved the ease of checking in and out through the mobile app. They have room keys sent to your phone so there was no standing in lines trying to get keys. Enjoyed our stay at the Mirage and can’t wait to go back!
50,What else can I say. Haven’t stayed I’m here in probably over 10 years and this trip did not disappoint. It’s walking distance to everything that you could get your hands on. Customer service that front desk from the time I had checked in to the time I had checked out exceeded my expectations.
50,We love staying at the Mirage. The location is perfect on the strip and dining options are great! We upgraded to a penthouse suite and we’re not disappointed. Great views and privacy. We will do stay here again.
50,The stay there was wonderful and I will be staying there again in the future. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The overall experience was great. The housekeeping kept refilling me on towels and other things.
30,Stay was good liked the room but didnt match the expectations. Food services was good but way expensive. Would not order from the pantry. Food were not that good enough. View was ok. Staff were friendly.
40,Enjoyed the room pool and casino. The staff was extremely friendly and are taking covid precautions very seriously. The Mirage is older and not perfect but very clean and well taken care of. The location is very convenient for exploring the strip. I would recommend and plan to stay here again.
10,I don't recommend visiting the Mirage during covid casino floor had more reps making sure masks were being worn than actual staff enhancing your experience. Only had 1 cocktail waitress and very few bartenders. Most the staff was rude which after speaking with them was due to the covid situation and how the owners were still profiting while they suffered.
50,I said all I had to in my review in the previous section of the survey. :)  Yet again I want to thank the staff for the incredible service and very friendly attitude mixed with their willingness to help me when I approached them with an issue!
20,When we got to our hotel room there was a used tissue on the ground by the bed and a dirty sock on the other side with trash still in a can. Called to get it fixed and they told us we would have to not be in the room for it to get clean. So we left for over 3 hours and came back to the same dirty room except a clean trash this time. Got moved to another room and it also wasn't clean so they had us stand there for a long time to go to another room. My wife and I were tired and the third room we got to also was dirty. The bathtub stop was broken and called for that to get fixed. it took a day for that to get fixed. Overall it was a dissapoining visit and we will not be staying there again.
10,This hotel completely sucks! Total nightmare! My parents first impression of Vegas! Our hotel room key would not work for three hours! We finally asked for an upgrade and got a room that was just as lame by the ice machine. Total epic fail!
50,The casino was clean beds were comfortable and had a great experience overall. Masks and sanitizers everywhere. Location was fantastic as well as the breakfast at Parlor. We enjoyed our stay a great deal.
40,Although there are still not any shows to speak of Vegas is coming back to life! The Mirage is in a great location on the strip and has wild Cats for your viewing. Staff and atmosphere was great and I can’t wait to go back!!
10,Dirty room never received my free room and when I called didn’t receive any help and the sad part I loved this hotel and the guest were friendly but management didn’t give me what they promised and I’m upset
50,Room was absolutely perfect staff was extremely nice rooms were very clean location was great also this hotel has a very very nice volcano 🌋 show that will surly WOOOOW you again if your looking for a nice clean friendly hotel the MIRAGE is definitely your stay
20,Came for my birthday alone. Picked this hotel because I've heard great things but I couldn't get any assistance with anything I needed help with. Long story short I didn't enjoy my birthday and that was the whole plan.
50,Extremely nice staff and hotel the restaurants were nice to eat at the room was extremely clean and the bed was very nice!!!! I would definitely recommend the mirage to anyone for any event at all!! Definitely always coming back
50,We brought our 6 kids to Vegas and had a blast. The Mirage didn’t let us down. The property is very well maintained. The hotel smell alone is so inviting. Having the Secret Garden on site was a huge bonus.
50,this place was very comfortable. its live all day long. clean and close on the strip. perfect place and friendly staff. very attentive. they made sure we were fine the whole stay. its independant when checking in that i like you dont have to talk to anyone at the desk you can check in through app
30,I payed for king room and got two queen beds I was kind of upset about that because it was my birthday and have been planning this for a while.But I ran with it any way but next time would like the king bed thank you.
10,Booked a penthouse and was really looking forward to staying at this property. Unfortunately I was totally underwhelmed with the experience here. Our room had a clogged sink damaged (dated) furniture no strip view and the pool was emptied out. When I called to book I specifically asked about the pool and was told that it would be open. Very disappointing experience. I won’t be staying here again.
10,The room was extremely outdated. Mismatched furniture that was horribly uncomfortable. The closet doors were broken. The refrigerator smelled horrible. The shower handle was broken. I travel to Vegas at least four times a year. I won't be staying at the Mirage in the future.
50,From the moment I valet my vehicle every step of the way forward my expectations were met. I recommend The Mirage to anyone who wants to be in the center of all the action and be recognized for it. You will truly enjoy your stay.
40,This hotels is well situated on the strip and has great value for the money. The restaurants are really good including a nice sports bar called The Still. They even have a year-round pool open. Overall a good choice among the MGM Hotels.
20,Was a fight outside our penthouse suite at 3 am that security over 20 minutes to respond to. Wife was nearly assaulted. No comps! I’m not sure what was going on but it sucked. Also the main tv was stuck on the history channel all weekend
50,The Mirage always provides a comfortable and welcoming experience right in the heart of the strip at an exceptional value with great in-hotel options in which to choose from such as California Pizza Kitchen The Still Center Bar Diablos and a new option Shacks which offers one of the best burgers and fries anywhere.
20,The rooms were still very nice and the location is excellent but the overall experience was subpar. Taking into consideration that COVID restrictions must be very difficult for all of these properties there were still things in the casino that could have been handled so much better. We went for a guys' weekend and found that on a Friday night there were only two tables of blackjack open for a total of six seats for blackjack players. There were six in our group so we would often occupy four of the seats while two others milled around or played other games while they waited for a seat to open up. Even with the extremely small number of tables open the dealers were terribly inexperienced and poorly trained. There were a few dealers that were excellent and what I've experienced at The Mirage previously but most didn't understand the side games were unacceptably slow and frequently missed payouts. The floor staff didn't seem quite as good either. I don't know if they laid off their more experienced dealers for cost-cutting and rehired new dealers cheaper but it made for a very frustrating experience.
50,The Mirage and it’s staff went above and beyond to insure we felt safe. Our room was flawlessly clean. The casino staff were constantly sanitizing all of the gaming equipment. Gloves masks and hand sanitizer was readily available for everyone. Thank you for a great weekend!!
40,Mirage just does things right. No disappointments all the times we have stayed. I would definitely suggest giving them a try if you’ve not been there before. The tropical themed property is a comfortable escape from the desert.
50,We have been coming to Las Vegas sine 1989 and have always stayed here. It is always excellent. The rooms are beautiful and very clean. The casino is super clean and well attended by staff. the Pantry restaurant is excellent.
50,This was our first trip to Las Vegas and The Mirage did not disappoint. We will most definitely be back! We were able to upgrade to a suite upon arrival and I am so glad we did it made for an amazing Vegas experience!
50,Great place to stay if you have kids! Very clean which is super important during COVID! I love the increase security presence on the Main floor. Since I was with my kids for the first time in Vegas it helped me rest easy!
50,The property is excellent. The service was superior compared to other hotel/casinos we've visited. There are hand washing stations sanitizing stations and masks available all throughout. When we checked into the room we noticed a vinyl bag containing 2 cloth face masks and hand sanitizer. I thought this was a lovely gesture.
30,Check in was ok we were assigned to a room that was very outdated with a dirty toilet and rusted tub. I took pictures and spoke w/ the front desk. In turn they provided a free upgrade which was very kind of them. The second room was much better however the tub was also rusted. Not many food options in the hotel open due to covid however when we walked Cesars Palace they were fully open. I’m guessing it’s at the discretion of the hotel.
40,We had a volcano room which was cool. I checked in using the app. It was super easy did have to go to the front desk at all. I printed a key myself later on using the self kiosk. I didn't like that the entrance is super far away from the hotel elevator.
50,My wife and I had a rare weekend off together. We decided to go to Las Vegas. We chose Mirage based on their location on the strip and their room rates. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the food was amazing.
40,My buddy and I had a nice stay at the Mirage. It has a fantastic location on the strip. I think they do a good job of keeping up the property. Everything was clean and the staff provided good service. Value for money spent was what I expected. Only reason for 4/5 stars is because I'm comparing it to the newer 5 star hotels on the strip. I can see why this hotel has had such a long run in Vegas. Good value for money great location good hotel.
50,Clean and entire hotel was sanitized. Room was clean. Slot machines kept clean. Bartenders gave exceptional service. Not one negative comment or feedback of our stay. We will come back and stay at The mirage again.
50,Had a blast and felt safe despite covid. Staff is friendly. Hotel is clean. The front garden is so fresh and beautiful. We upgraded up to a two bedroom penthouse happy we did this would highly recommend
50,No need to leave the resort since everything is here. My only issue was at Heritage Steak. This was a disappointing experience due to the pricing point of entrees. No tablecloths no crumb person didn't feel high end at all. Service was good not exceptional. Decent portions.
40,"We arrived at about 10:30PM on Friday January 15th for a three night stay.    We used mobile check-in using the MGM App; therefore we were able to skip the front desk completely. It worked out well.    We reserved a Stay Well King Room and were assigned to 12-061. This is a nice room and we had north and west facing views from our room which showed us the hotels north of us and the mountains and valley to the west.    The bathrooms are tiny in most rooms at the Mirage; however other than that our room was in very good condition. The Stay Well Rooms have a firm mattress; however you really sleep well. The room was very clean and we felt very comfortable inside of the room.    The overall resort is still in good condition with all the common areas being in awesome shape.    So there was one problem. When you stay in a Staywell room you do pay an upgraded fee for certain amenities. Most of the Staywell amenities in our room were not working or not properly serviced. The air purifier in our room would not work since the ""replace filter"" light was on. The aromatherapy machine was non-operable. The shower infuser was empty. However on the plus side we loved the energizing light in the bathroom and the Staywell mattress. We did call down to the Front Desk to ask for maintenance on the three items on Friday evening. They never came. WE followed up on Saturday with a in-person visit to the front desk and they still never came.    So we were disappointed that we did not get to use most of the StayWell amenities. I hope for a 5 star stay next time."
50,It was my husbands first time staying here and he loved it. I have stay here many times before for work or girls trip and have always enjoyed my stay! You guys are doing an awesome job trying to keep the hotel Super Clean and Sanitized during COVID! Thank you so much!! This place is also Great stay if you have Children!!
50,From the moment I parked in the complimentary parking garage to the time I left the Mirage staff made me feel like family. Not the annoying family member you wish you didn’t have but the one everyone loves to be around. Every individual there I interacted with seemed genuine and helpful from check in to check out.
30,When we arrived the service was amazing and very polite. Although the rooms in itself were beautifully designed but had its downers. The bedroom tv we had would not go down into its sleep setting and tv wouldn’t stay on for more than 3secs the vanity in the bathroom wasn’t working either then the switch which opens the curtains wouldn’t open them. After a quick call to the front desk they changed us room only for us to experience the bar fridge being locked and not working. The front room TV remote not working properly for certain buttons and the room only had 1 single toilet paper roll to start off with
40,We stayed for 2 nights. Clean room and friendly staff. Love how you need your room key to access the elevators. My only complaint would be the shower head was old and flowing different directions ... and it was super low. I’m short and it was still too low for me.
50,Our stay at the Mirage was fantastic! Our view overlooking the Strip and the Volcano show was a really great touch. The staff were all so courteous and professional and really made our stay memorable.
50,We visited Las Vegas as a family for a camp for my son. We rented a car and needed to drive to Summerlin twice a day. The self parking garage was easily accessible and the location of the hotel was superb in relation to the highway. The hotel room was very large and extremely clean...even the parking garage was spotless! The only thing that would make the whole experience a 10 would be upgraded linens (towels and sheets).
50,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Mirage from start to finish. I appreciated the contactless check in via the app and the room key access via the app which was very convenient as well as made us feel safer without having to be in contact with too many people during the COVID pandemic. It was clear just walking through the casino that extra space was added as were sanitizer stations. The safety seal on the door to our room was also an added touch of comfort for our concerns about cleanliness. Sadly I experienced a medical emergency while at the hotel which forced us to leave earlier than expected however the security staff was very caring and helpful and made us feel comfortable despite the embarrassment I felt for being taken out of the room on a stretcher (cardiac not COVID). When I returned to the hotel from the hospital we were sad that we had to leave and head home four days early but the staff was very understanding and helpful and worked with us quickly and easily to arrange transport to the airport and checked us out early without any hassle at all. The room while we were there was also very comfortable. We look forward to going back sometime soon now that I'm feeling better and having a chance to finish enjoying our stay at this wonderful hotel.
50,It was a great getaway here at the Mirage had a great time during our stay. Staff was nice and helpful. The secret garden was a a nice experience the animals were beautiful and they looked like they were taken care of.
40,Stop over on the way to Utah and the Mirage was a property I've never stayed at with a good deal of $100 for a Friday night including the $39 resort fee. We felt totally COVID safe here. Room was good everything was clean and in good shape for an older hotel which was a concern for me hence the title of the review. Bathroom needs updating but was fine. Casino floor was the same all socially distanced and protected with barriers though I'm not ready to handle everyone else's cash and chips yet :-)    Special shoutout to the Heritage Steakhouse. WOW. We had awesome dine-in NY Strip and salmon. Must visit.
40,The Mirage is a good place to stay. Great location on the strip. Rooms are comfortable. The pool is nice and heated. During Covid time they are taking very seriously keeping everything sanitized...as best you can. The staff is very welcoming they are glad we are back. I felt very comfortable and safe.
40,Perfect location right in the middle of the strip!! So beautiful inside and out and clean! Just a great inviting place! Was nice being able to check in on our phones and have our room key on there too didn’t have to worry about dealing with the front desk!
20,"Only a couple of dining options and I had a noisy neighbor. With the hotel at LOW capacity not sure why I even had neighbors? The Mirage is ""ok"" but I'll pay more for the Mandalay next time. It's worth the extra money. Rooms are better Mandalay at least has a food court which helps a lot with so many restaurants closed due to covid."
50,Service was great you can’t beat the location. Do you need to try the crepes at the Blizz. Do not forget to visit the Dolphins. You can do great shopping right next door and from there you can go all around the strip.
20,I arrived to Las Vegas for my first trip in hopes I would return to this hotel. I have heard many great things about this hotel but walking into a dirty room and failed promises on how to resolve the issue. Walking into a room with drugs on my counter was beyond unsatisfying. I was angry to have this as my first experience with Mirage. This needed to be resolved and I feel I should have been reimbursed for my room. The hotel is beautiful and loved the view and the staff was friendly. However my room made this a awful experience.
50,I loved it. From the time we checked in to the time we checked out the staff was very helpful and accommodating. Everything was clean and the maid was prompt and efficient. We will definitely be staying again
40,Local resident. Stayed for a girls night. No complaints. Room was clean mobile check in was a breeze. Wished the TVs were updated a bit with Netflix and such but other than that it was a great stay. Not all hotel restaurants are open due to Covid but the location of the mirage was near plenty of options.
30,Room was clean and nice but elevator broke and had someone struck that fire department had to rescue. Lots of employees walking around but not much cleaning going on. Waitresses not passing by as often as before maybe once every 20 minutes
40,The rooms were nice and clean. Always someone wiping things down. The only draw back is no microwave and if you touch the refrigerator you will be charged a fee. Located near plenty of shopping and food.
50,The room was clean. The location was excellent.... right in the middle of the strip. I will Recommend to family and friends. We couldn’t bet the price. Will be booking again in summer. We ate at the still which is inside of the Mirage & it was delicious.
50,We’ve stayed at the Mirage twice and will come back again. The Mirage has a very pleasant and unique scent compared to other Vegas properties. The staff is excellent and the rooms clean and comfortable. The location is nice center strip! A great place to stay highly recommend.
30,Was disappointed when I got to my room got the queen room with 2 beds Volcano view but the linen that I was expecting was definitely not there.. plain boring all white linen where purple was advertised on their website.. Misleading advertising..
10,Don’t stay here! Staff is horrible. We arrived Monday night room was hot and safe was locked. We called that night they didn’t come up to check (thought since we checked in around midnight it was late tomorrow am) tuesday am when we woke up I called again stated same issues. We went out all day (didn’t leave privacy sign on) got back in late And guess what it wasn’t fixed. Called again more aggravated nothing was fixed that night. Well come Wednesday am called again we went out came back around 3 and nothing was fixed. We packed out bags and left to the Wynn (now thats a hotel)
30,Staff that we met (Security) were friendly and doing their best to control the crowd.  Check in - I love MGM app and being able to access through my phone. It sure beats that long line we saw when we came in. It was so nice to go straight to our room.  Guest Room - The door shower was broken or off tract so the water kept shooting outside and the shower wasn't working - not able to move it! Bathroom toilet makes noise all night as if something is dripping. Room was nice but a little run down...    I didn't understand the hotel elevators and why we would only have two floors (24 & 25). Not understanding how to get to our room until afterwards another guest told me to use my phone.    Although it was during the NYE 2020 - we didn't anticipate it being crazy busy. The hotel should have had their valet services available even if ti's on the weekend. It was a mad house from the parking lot to the lobby to the elevators...Didn't matter what time - It was NUTS in Las Vegas! Super crazy.  One time visit though!!!
40,Decided last minute to go to Vegas for New Years Eve. Rooms were affordable and comfortable! Check in was a breeze and the staff was helpful! Lots of Resturants and entertainment to choose from and the hotel is located in the middle of the strip so everything was accessible! I would definitely recommend!
10,Super disappointed that the Mirage wouldn’t return my money or transfer my reservation. We had a reservation for my nieces 21st birthday through Southwest we purchased the hotel and airline tickets through southwest on a package. We were in Vegas a month and half prior and saw that the Mirage was not open due to Covid. When we got home we canceled our flight and what we believe was our package. But we were still charge for the hotel I called them and they said that we did not cancel the hotel. I couldn’t understand that because we purchased them as a package. I knew it was a mistake so I called them Mirage to confirm and they said no we had to cancel separately. Just being not a tangible product that cost them anything I couldn’t see why they would not reimburse me or let me use at a later date. They said NO. So we did not get to enjoy our vacation and now we’re out the money to ever have a vacation. So disappointing in this company. It’s clear that we canceled the package prior to our travel date.  They would not even transfer it to a different date so we could enjoy a trip. Out $566.11 and when you’ve been off from work for five months due to Covid it really sucks!!
10,Room was dirty and heating system was extremely dirty.. Has not been cleaned in months...very dissatisfied with room and how staff handled the situation... I showed them the pics and told them just to hear in return that I was not supposed to look in there.. And they would give me my resort fee back.. Still had to pay for a dirty room
30,Garage was packed on friday and saturday hard to find parking and valet not currently offered. Long walk between garage and guest elevators. Escalators and garage elevators were not functioning on saturday so had to walk several flights up to reach the car. Room floor was tilted at a slant felt like we were on a cruise ship. Leather headboards had rips and need to be replaced.
10,The room is old. The bathtub was rusting. It felt like a motel room. Only good about this hotel is the location. And the volcano show. I understand it’s an old hotel but it can be upgraded. Or atleast replace rusting tubs!
50,We stayed at the Mirage for NYE to bring in 2021 and had a great room with a wonderful view of the strip and volcano! I was very pleased to see how well this older hotel had been maintained and the lush tropical plants were beautiful throughout the property!
20,The failure to provide a clean room or even a fully functional room in a suite that set high expectations provided an unsatisfying stay for me and my new wife. Upon check out there was compensation for all the issues we faced with the hotel but compensation is just that and nothing more.
20,Room was very dirt and the chairs still had a stain and crumbs on it. Check the showers. Ours made a horrible noise and there was mold on the ceiling and walls. The rooms look way nicer on picture. We got good service at the Rhumbar from one waitress. Most of the rest of the servers could careless. If you want to table gamble they only have a handle full open with $25 up to 200 max.
30,There was a horrible smell in the room when we arrived after getting moved it was better but there was a strange smell in the bathroom of the new room as well. The Staff were friendly and helpful. Casino area and restaurants were great food was fantastic (large portions) a bit pricy. Overall a good hotel they are part of the MGM Resort group so many perks at other hotels because you were staying at one of the hotels in the group.
40,Liked the vibe of the Mirage. Check-In was fast and there was every slot you could think of on the casino floor. The hotel is huge so it is tiring to get around sometimes but it was worth it. Good family or solo trip location
40,Every single thing except hotel room bathroom was great. Love this resort...location casino restaurants staff but the hotel room bathroom was just awful. Rooms could use an update new shower heads or tiled shower pocket door for bathroom and new toilets would have made this much better! Also the safe in our room didn’t work.
20,Front desk who attended us was very passive aggressive towards me and my wife which made it very uncomfortable on our first night welcome  Once we got into our Hotel room we found scraps of trash throughout the room floor seem to us the room wasn’t properly cleaned being that we are in a pandemic doesn’t seem quite ethical/acceptablewe avoided bringing up our complaints due to trying avoid any interaction with the desk attendant that helped us prior ! We love The Mirage but unfortunately due to this experience that might have changed!
20,There are numerous better value options on the strip. The restrooms are old the staff is not friendly food options are limited. There is lack of information on their sites COVID is an excuse for them to slack on everything in the resort. Couldn’t even buy milk in the resort one of the nights
50,I felt like this hotel was not too crowded and everything was very clean. The dealer was telling people to put their mask on the pit boss was telling people to step back which I liked. I was able to check in early with no hassle and check out using my phone so everything was hassle free.
50,If you are looking for a casino and hotel that offers great customer service great food and amenities this is the place! Not too large but for us just the right size! It is a little dated but it’s very clean!
50,The Mirage was great as always for a NYE get away! My wife and I enjoyed our Mirage Suite with a great view of the Strip! The room was clean and spacious and the Casino was very clean as always! I will return soon.
40,1-2 mile walk to either end of the strip. Close to The Fashion Show Mall. Room shower had so much pressure it was painful. No plug-ins next to the bed. Mattress a little firm. Great food although limited options due to Covid restrictions. Friendly staff. Lots of Security.
30,The hotel room was good not until I got into the restroom was not really cleaned. They must of missed the tube was dirty. Other than the tube everything in the room was average. The costumer service was average it could of been better though. My precious stay was really good no problems at all and service was great.  This time eventually was not the dam e experience. But it all varies I guess on who helps you out. I would stay again though.
40,Clean room very friendly staff close to many scenes on the strip offered us an upgrade when we checked in nice amenities in the hotel! The hotel took many precautions to keep people healthy and safe during our stay.
30,Room was dirty - blood or similar on doorhandles.    Have stayed at Mirage before but this time the standard was not there. Especially during covid times - sanitization had not occurred in the room as the sticker was broken on both doors of the suite.
50,Staying at the mirage you are in the heart of it all. Glad to see the volcano show during the pandemic. Room was fresh and beds were so comfortable! Housekeeping was great and the staff was friendly. Glad to be back and help the economy!
40,hope there’s a choice not to pay the hotel resorts fee.  the check in was easy.  you can do online or at the hotel.  there’s no laundry area that you can use 😔  the room was clean but the bathrooms not clean nicely.
50,Our first time staying at the Mirage the room was clean very spacious and we got nice view to the strip. Over all it was a. Nice experience. Plus the location is awesome because you have easy access to other casinos and the strip.
40,Fast and friendly service. The staff was friendly and were eager to help at anytime. The location is absolutely the best in my opinion. It is across from several attractions and within walking distance to a lot of things.
10,I had so many problems.. my phone wasn’t working to get my luggage up so i went to the lobby to get it fixed and that never happened. Room was dusty I assumed it would be near spotless considering the pandemic. Fridge was locked on arrival. Bath tub took forever to fill up considering the drain hardly worked. I was told that I would have house keeping everyday and I honestly don’t think they came once.. the upsides are that the beds are super comfortable and the bell hops were super nice. Plus the location is prime considering it’s kind of central.
30,Boring. Poor value for the money. Property in poor condition overall with tremendous signs of normal wear and tear. Inappropriate repairs made to furniture shower tile and baseboards. Very slip shod attempts to fix problems.
10,The rooms are not how they appear online. The front desk manager was horrible. We experienced poor rooms and broken showers. The stay was so bad we decided to check out early and was penalized for doing so.
10,We got to our room to find used qtips left behind in the window sill and the floors were stained and the walls looked dirty. It was our wedding night and it was sad and we definitely overpaid for a room that was dirty.
50,Went for birthday/New Years Eve and had so much fun! The pandemic didn't keep us down. Just adhere to the rules and go about having a good time. Plenty of restaurants to still choose from but probably be best to make reservations even for breakfast!
30,Great location and large suite was very nice and clean. Overall the stay was pretty good however there are a few things which would prevent me returning. First room hot water was an issue at times (not enough). Second the view was probably one of the best in Vegas however the Beatles wrap on the outside of the building really ruined it and made it difficult to appreciate. I would not stay at any of the suites near the top. Third the gym's limited hours (9am-6) and mask requirement while working out was not convenient.
10,We clearly marked on our reservation we wanted a north facing room and they did accommodate. After talking to the suite manager he told me he dont read those requests and we could not accommodate the requests . He stated that i should not tell him how to do his job and that all rooms were booked up. Evethou there were clear suite rooms that were emptied across the hall where we requested to be moved too. This guys was really terrible and should not be a manager at a mgm hotel.
40,Check in experience was exceptional. Only reason for 4 stars is room was outdated and had some maintenance issues. Was not the type of room expected at 4 star resort Casino was excellent as well as the food
50,We’ve stayed along the strip many times but staying at the Mirage is the perfect place for location and a clean friendly atmosphere. The staff went out of their way to make us feel at home. Definitely where we would stay in the future.
10,"At check-in I was offered an ""Upgrade"" from my original room (not surprised as I'm an MLife member) but was sadly very disappointed. Room 25-054 was the ""upgraded"" room but had several problems. The shower head was broken and almost detached from the wall which made it impossible to move and adjust. On the shower floor as well as on the ceiling above the toilet and sinks was a weird discolored substance that looked like dried urine but not exactly sure what it was. The room was also very dusty and seemed to be untouched which was not nice. The bedside clock was also an issue as the power connection was messed up and made the clock go on and off which is annoying when trying to sleep. The USB connectors at the work station were also a problem as two of the three connectors were not functioning. Usually the Mirage is a great hotel to stay at and last time we were upgraded to a Penthouse Suite which was nice. If you choose to stay at the Mirage be sure you have other dining options as there is only room service between 7am-2pm several of the restaurants are closed (COVID-19) so be prepared to not have lots of options for food. Wish I had better news but the rooms at the Mirage are currently not very good."
40,We love staying at The Mirage. Beautiful hotel and nice accommodations. Unfortunately we didn’t sleep well. It was loud lots of people slamming their doors and our bed was super stiff. I would want the bed to be softer.
20,Watch out for hidden fees. They will change double your room reservation upon check in and do not disclose this information. The resort does not do a great job at cleaning the casino floor. You will see someone with a cloth walking around from time to time to wipe things down but nothing like it should be. The resort is just a standard hotel and nothing stood out as great and did not make me want to return. Can find better resorts at better prices on the Strip in Las Vegas.
50,Check in was a breeze. The layout was perfect. The food was amazing. All the staff was friendly anytime I have a question. This is a dog friendly casino. So if you have a service dog this is a perfect place for you. This casino is in prime location  very close to everything.
50,Great get away. Hotel was very clean. COVID rules were logical and enforced. As with all casinos it was Smokey but the hotel had a flowery smell in the air that made it tolerable. Some of the amenities were closed but not a big inconvenience
30,While the location of the Mirage is great the penthouse suites need some love. We had issues with the bathroom sinks (when you turned one on the other filled up) which took over 2 days to get addressed even though we let them know the evening we checked in. The bedroom tv went up and down on its own and took over a day and a half to get addressed. There was a huge crack in the window overlooking the strip which distorted the view. Additionally the bar counter and parts of the bathroom floor were stained.
40,I hadn't been back to the Casino/hotel for awhile. As locals we decided to spend Christmas eve as a family in the 2 bedroom penthouse. The Mirage is still lovely love the main lobby.    The room was nice but for a penthouse seemed rather sparse (I am assuming COVID) so no coffee maker. No microwave and no spare well anything ie blankets or pillows.    Again I'm fairly sure it is due to COVID cleaning restrictions but was surprised. It would have been nice to warm up the food we had to pick up due to dining restriction and to make some coffee without running to the floor restaurants.    All in all though enjoyed our stay. The remote didn't work but they sent someone up fairly quickly and beds comfortable. Beautiful bathrooms if we were staying longer. Nice views.
40,Great location spacious and modern rooms. Very good staff. I had a room with on the strip and on the volcano on the 23rd floor. Be careful end of December 2020 the poker room was closed (transformed) even if their website indicated that it is still open. Only the small (outdoor) swimming pool is opened (not the big one) and the water was not as warm as the Bellagio's one.
50,Have not stayed at The Mirage in years. Everything was to liking. The service was excellent. Food including room service was hot and delicious. The suites still needed some updating but that did not bother us. We had lovely view. Beds comfortable and pillows divine. Not disappointed in the visit.
10,No tv the entire time and called multiple times for the tv to be fixed. We were told it wasn’t working building wide but it was working in friends rooms. Also we specifically called and asked before booking if the main pool area and waterfall was open. Which is the entire reason we stayed here. Our other nights we stayed at Paris Las Vegas and switched to the mirage because it had an open pool starting Friday. When we got here the main pool and waterfall area all was closed and only a very small side pool that was crowded with people.
50,Everything was very good rooms casino sleeping service especially the front desk clean we had a small issue at the beginning as I mentioned before (with the 2 queen bedroom) but you guys solve it right the way thanks.
50,Mirage hotel offers mid-high $ and its provides more than expected. Your stay will give you the feel of being in a cabana at a luxury resort. Friendly staff super clean property with top security for your safety. It has the easiest access to the strip where you can get to all your wants and needs in minutes. Their pool is gorgeous one of the best in town. They have dolphins and tigers/lions right on the property for you and your family to explore.
40,Great place to stay. Easy to get around. Place is clean and sanitized all the time. Very nicely decorated at Xmas. The only bad thing is the bed. I sleep on pillow top and this bed is rock top. Sore back every day!
40,Check in was wonderful and housekeeping workers were friendly. They might want to have them to train the casino floor staff. The casino floor Waiter that bring the drinks were very rude. Watched them help everyone else even after we tried to get their attention on multiple occasions.
10,Very old and dated rooms. Bathrooms are the worst part of the room. Beds sag. Another big issue is the powerful smell off cigarette smoke throughout hotel and in the room. Heat didn’t work. Only saving Grace was front desk willing to work with us and move us twice until we could actually relax. Don’t count on maintenance ever showing up at your room to help either. Good luck with that.
10,Hoping it was because of Covid that are stay was horrible. Just felt like nobody cared whether you were there or not. Nothing opened late no vending machines for water no room service. No comps pr free play. Not what we expected. Should have stayed at Stratosphere where they seem to at least give you freepkay your first day for booking a room.
40,We love the Mirage and had another great stay. Friendly staff great food and drink. We definitely like the convenience of having a crosswalk to get to the other side of the strip. We are looking forward to our next trip this spring.
40,The hotel was nice the staff at the front desk and housekeeping were very friend and able and willing to accommodate my needs. The view was nice and all parts of hotel were very clean and neat. I would definitely return due to the value received in the cost.
50,We absolutely love this hotel because of the staff and the tranquility of the hotel.  Our check in with Jessica at the front desk was great. She was very helpful and warmly greeted us upon arrival.  We certainly look forward to returning here again because of the tranquility after walking the strip.
40,First time at the Mirage. Enjoyed our stay. We'll definitely be back soon everything was clean and felt safe. Face mask' enforcement is a great idea making sure everyone is protected from one another. See you soon.
50,The Mirage security did a great job assuring that all guests were wearing mask. Politely ask 3 guest that had their shirts over there face to use a mask. And then handed them a courtesy mask. I was impressed from what I had seen around the town.
50,I would highly recommend this hotel and casino. Super friendly and great atmosphere. I would say get the volcano room it’s worth every penny. Made the weekend even more exciting. Also the restaurant The Still is absolutely amazing. You need to try their deep fried Oreos!
50,There was nothing but quality service during our stay from the time we checked in the staff went above and beyond to accommodate our needs making our stay one of the best I’ve experienced.  I will be returning again
50,Excellent rooms bed and pillows amazing which makes all the difference to your stay..........staff very accomodating and friendly great resort amenities . Mirage always the best deal!! Surrounding casinos do not come upto the standard of MGM and Mirage!!
50,My first visit to Vegas and definitely won't be my last. Being at The Mirage definitely made it all worth while. From the staff to the room everything was clean and of professional standard. Very pleasant and adhered to the CDC guidelines for Covid.
50,Everyone at the Mirage made this a memorable and safe experience! Times are weird and the casino and staff out a lot of effort into safety and still making it that fun Vegas experience. I’m excited to go back again soon.
40,Hotel was great great location but does not seem to be updated since we were there in 2013. But great value during all of the lockdowns it was not the fault of the hotel but the casino was not real happening... we hope that changes soon.
50,Safety measures and customer service were excellent considering the season we're in. Loved arriving to a door with a cleanliness indicator at the door and having the option to deny cleaning service during our stay. We were only there one night - slept soundly the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable the room was quiet and clean. Very pleased with our experience.
30,Overall not impressed. The lobby and casino area is definitely the nice part about Mirage. The room could have been much better. Hair on the bathroom floor shower head that sprayed the ceiling and couldn’t be adjusted something sprayed on the headboard that you could see in sunlight half ass made bed (I had to tuck the top sheet under the mattress) dirty comforter. I guess I expected a cleaner room with the virus but I just felt more awkward in the room. It honestly wasn’t horrible but it gave off 3 star hotel room vibes for the 4 star hotel that it is. Great location but they need to update the rooms and clean better.
20,The overall experience with the hotel was good but was diminished by security harassing my party about how and when to wear a mask to the point that 5 of them followed us throughout the casino. Room was excellent the cocktail waitresses were excellent along with the front desk staff. If you are planning to gamble have a cocktail or smoke in the casino be prepared to be constantly harassed as to how and when you wear a mask.
50,The hotel and casino was very clean spacious and didn't smell like smoke. I would definitely stay at Mirage again. The Pantry Restaurant had excellent breakfast however its pricey ranging from $$ - $$$ but so worth it. My breakfast kept me full until dinner.
50,Nice stay resort fee too much for limited access to hospital amenities. The temperature was hard to maintain as it was cold the entire stay. Pricey sundry items which is to be expected at the higher end hotels but wasn't expecting it at the Mirage.
50,Stayed in a King Tower Room and it was really clean bed comfy and room the slots were nice too. I've stayed at Mirage a few times and never have they disappointed me. There were a few restaurants open Pantry the Sill Bar & Grill and there was a Deli that replaced Carnegi Deli up front. Will be returning in January. Only thing was that California Pizza was closed even on the weekend. Great stay
50,We upgraded to the Stay Well King room with volcano view. Had an issue with finding a pill on the bathroom floor (turned out to just be Tylenol) but left me wondering how clean these rooms actually are. I used a tissue to pick up the pill and grabbed a handful of hair too. The bed was clean and comfortable. Im not sure the aroma therapy was working in our room because I never noticed anything. Watch out for that minibar. I grabbed some M&Ms and those turned out to be $18. Beers were only $12 which isn’t too bad. Plenty of places to plug in your devices. Bathroom was small but I’m not living here just seating for a few nights. The room was a great size. Great views in the evenings. We watched the volcano from the room but it’s definitely worth watching outside with the sound effects. All the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. Great atmosphere!    We made a reservation at Bare and had a great day down there. Great service. The water was cold and you have to be all the way in the way to remove the mask at the pool. They didn’t allow you to just sit on the edge with feet in.    Had no problems finding tables to play at until closer to the weekend. They have so many tables closed that they fill up fast.    All In all we would definitely stay here again.
50,I love cleanliness at the hotels I stay.  I am 100% satisfied.    The hotel provides a kit with a mask a d hand sanitizer fir the guests and that just made me feel safer at my room.    The hotel had hand sanitizer all over the areas. The checkout process is great we didn’t have to make a long line to checkout we did it right from our room. Minimum personal contact which is safer for everyone during this pandemic.
50,It was really nice and true cleanest hotel I ever stayed in Las Vegas. I enjoyed it even though it was one day. I hope they bring shoes safely and that it becomes normal soon. This did not ruin the experience I just wished the buffet was open.
30,My sister had her wedding here. They did an amazing job...food was wonderful it was everything she expected and more!!!    Now the rooms were just ok. I felt like they could have been a lot cleaner and the sheets were very dingy looking. Not my first choice for a normal rm.
50,We have been to vegas 3 times in the last year and have stayed at 4 different hotels. The mirage has been one of the best regarding covid from the cleaniness of the rooms and table games to the availability of sanitation stations throughout the propert . I felt safe
50,I'm still sharing pics of the room and the view it had of the strip. From the minute I checked in to time I checked out the service was outstanding. I couldn't believe how enjoyable my experience was even in this time of covid. I git it 5 stars.
50,We always stay at the Mirage. We just feel at home.  The location is perfect and still maintains the high standards of Vegas’s first Mega Resort.  During these trying times the hotel seems to be making every effort to ensure safety. Upon arrival you’ll find your room immaculate and sealed. Inside are complimentary masks and portable sized hand sanitizer. Everywhere you go on property you’ll see normal touch surfaces being constantly wiped down. We felt completely comfortable.
10,Everything closed rude employees and absurd prices this place has went downhill fast beyond my comprehension I heard all MGM properties are like this now very very sad!! So many other better choices now!
50,Went with my daughter had an amazing time. The staff was friendly. I had a beautiful view of the fountains and the volcano. The room was clean. Wanted to see the secret garden and the new dolphin. I want able to.
30,Good hotel clean close to new Vegas but no drinks if your spending money!!! You have to go purchase drinks on your own. Went to several other casinos and offered 2 3 drinks within hour. I did like the room not that we spent much time there.
50,We were able to take video of the wonderful (night) view from the top of the parking lot !  It was Amazing 🤩! During the morning we just crossed the street to have some breakfast and coffee and take pictures in the way back !
50,We felt like VIPs staying at the Mirage. The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. The bellman are friendly and got our luggage to and from the room fast. The only distraction from a perfect stay is the self-parking. It was free but getting to and from the garage is confusing. More signs directing you back to the main entrance would be nice
20,Room was not properly cleaned broken and exposed electrical outlet missing toilet cap torn bed / backboard leather dirty sock on the floor from previous people. We told the front desk and they apologized but didn’t offer to switch us to another room.
50,Easy check in via MGM app. The app provided me with a digital key so I avoided the check-in/mobile check-in line. The room was clean & smelled great. There was plenty to do there (restaurants stores gambling & entertainment). Housekeeping was awesome. They cleaned & sanitized my room daily. They greeted me everytime I walked through the halls. That made me feel welcomed. Definitely will return.
10,I was disappointed & underwhelmed in the lack of upkeep of their rooms. I stayed in 2 rooms during my stay and both had broken/chipped furniture dust and heavy carpeting stains. Not The Mirage I expected.
50,My family stayed at the Mirage over Thanksgiving weekend. With the pandemic slowing things down I was worried service may be lacking. Everyone there was wonderful. Dining staff check in cocktail waitresses security gift shop staff were all hard working and friendly. I love the location. The hotel had everything we needed or wanted.
50,Great room great staff! We arrived at 10am on Friday was unsure if we could get an early check-in. The front desk gal was amazing! Early check in and late check out PLUS a view of the Volcano! We loved it! House keeping was on point. Room was nice and big if I was looking for something to be a lil negative about the bathroom is on the smaller side. But overall from the room to the staff you couldn't ask for better. And the location was perfect! We usually stay on the south end of the strip this is so much better. Right in the middle of the action. Also the table games staff for the most part were amazing. Just one bad apple.
50,Lots of places to see and visit where it’s not too far from everything on the strip. Easy access to shopping malls especially cesars shopping and plenty to see. Easy access to freeway and parking lot.
20,This was my first visit to vegas and after a lot of research we decided to stay in the mirage priced at 90+$ per day. But it was a bad decision the room didn't feel clean thick layer of dust on the surfaces with an extremely unpleasant view and a very small bathroom. Overall a poor experience for the brand value this hotel has.
30,Too noisy at night  No coffee brewer in the room  The shower was not draining fast enough  I upgraded my reservation but it was not worth it  The view was OK  Too nosy at night  I wish to have stayed at a real suit and not the upgrade the offer.
50,Hotel was very comfortable. And exceptionally clean and quiet. This was my first time staying at this location I've stayed at numerous hotels on the strip. Food choices were great but due to Covid California Kitchen was closed. All in all great experience.
40,The staff was very nice and I saw lots of people cleaning everything. There was plenty of social distancing and even the tables had plexiglass separators which was a surprise. Wish there was poker though.
50,Great Room! We found the room very clean with comfortable beds! Friendly Staff! Front Desk staff was very friendly and checked us in quickly! Good Location! Located in the middle of the strip close to many casinos and chose to shows. Steakhouse in the Mirage was Excellent!
10,We changed rooms twice and it only got worse . I will never return to this hotel not even to gamble . I was disappointed  after looking at the rooms online and recent vide on YouTube. I thought things would be great . Oh how I was wrong  either they gave us the worse rooms in the hotel or the whole building is trash
10,First we got the room # 12074 the bed room frame is making squeaky noise every time we lay on the bed and turn or move our bodies. We called the front desk and reported. Then they gave us a different room. The bed from different room # 12070 is better but the the bathroom exhausted fan is supper loud it can make me debt every time when we use the bathroom.
10,When we arrived in our room the first thing we noticed was that the bathtub was dirty and there were random hairs on our towels.    Calling the front desk or concierge was basically useless no answers or closed. Rude staff when calling the front desk. This hotel has very few food options late night and no reasonably priced options during the day. Will not stay here on our next trip. Of all of the hotel properties we visited on this trip The Mirage was the least nice property.
30,The casino and room was very clean. Wash stations easy to find and fully stocked. Masks and hand sanitizers were available. My husband and I were fully asleep and awoken by a staff person saying housekeeping and all the did was peek into the room and just closed the door. I was very annoyed for the rest of my stay.
20,Got hit with the all famous resort fee at checkoutan additional $175.  The manager was very unaccomadating.He told me that no matter what I said or did I was going to pay.Do not use the mini fridgeI put some food in it and was almost charged a fee for that.The food is way overpriced.The sports bar changes the rules on drinking depending on who the bartender is.One day the beer was freeone day you have to put $20 in the machine and one day you have to sign up for the rewards card.The bar mannager was a complete jerk that yelled at the bartender in front of everyone and wouldnt even come talk to me.The floor waitreses were few and far in between.Most employees were very nice.The room was nice and clean.Vegas has changed lots in the past few years. The mirage is a place I will never stay at due to management.
50,A great spot from which to enjoy all that Vegas and surrounding has to offer. Staff was friendly and helpful. The beds were excellent and allowed us to get well re-charged for the next day's adventures.
50,This place is great. Awesome rooms with great views. It's located right in the heart of the strip with ceasers beside it venetian across from it. The staff is excellent and they just really know how to treat people. First time I was there I lost a 100 grand and still wanted to go back.
10,Staff were not very friendly. Only one place for breakfast with incredibly high prices! The supposed King Volcano View Suite we booked turned out to be comparable to a regular Motel Six room. Our room was smaller than a normal suite; it's bathroom was fit for only one not two like normal suites. Only one tiny soap for two people; no volcano view but an ugly roof top view; and people yelling in the hallways throughout the night making it very difficult to sleep.
40,Book this trip for a quick getaway ... first time staying at mirage. Location is perfect everything was clean... rooms are a little outdated  Restaurants served good food  Overall liked the hotel and enjoyed my time here
10,My room was dusty. I was charged twice and at check in they kept giving us the round around . I still try to call front desk to get my money back because I was charged twice they said it was not coming up and her computer
50,Great price great location enjoyed my stay and they definitely are taking precautions during this pandemic. Walk right out and your in the middle of the strip. You can walk anywhere free parking The volcano was awesome
20,"The bed was so hard that both me and my husband could hardly sleep and we both had to see a chiropractor when we returned home and get a massage. Also the cokes in the mini fridge were $10 and if you get your own you can't use the fridge in the room because if you move anything they charge you $50. Why do the pringles and nuts need to be in the fridge? I wish the mirage would stop trying to nickle and dime people. They also were supposed to give a $60 per day food and beverage credit but they said ""I wasn't actually signed up for"". The only good part was the location you are right in the middle of the strip or walking over for food or drinks."
40,I enjoyed the hotel location and customer service would definitely stay again as well as recommend to others. Most of the staff was very friendly. There were a nice variety of of restaurants on site so there wasn't a NEED to leave the grounds if you don't want to.
40,Our stay at the Mirage was pleasant except for some noisy guests being loud and rude at different time during the night and early hours. But the hotel staff was nice and friendly. Not much you can expect during a “pandemic” year. Most businesses were closed only a few restaurants to choose from. Our favorite Chinese restaurant at Paris was closed.
20,Old rooms maintenance issues. First room literally had no commode. New room had multiple maintenance issues that were never corrected. Two calls to fix problems. No response from maintenance. Paid for a 1700 sq foot room and could never use the nice bath tub because there was no hot water and the plug was broken. Other shower wouldn’t drain.
50,Very nice rooms. I will definitely be back. Front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was nice with a big screen TV. Quiet and relaxing. I like the ambiance downstairs with the palm trees and the water.
30,We stayed in a suite which was dated had some things that needed repaired and on a Saturday night while playing machines we couldn't find a cocktail waitress along with other gamblers. The location is excellent for our needs and the exterior of the property was gorgeous.
10,The room was terrible and a Motel 6 would be better. Yes the hotel is on the strip but I guarantee you will get big if not worse. The sinks and ceiling if the hotel were falling apart and full of grime that has not been cleaned for year's. I have never in my life taken time to leave a review but I was disgusted by these rooms. The casino and entrance areas were fine the rooms were terrible even with an upgrade things were bad
30,Hotel needs upgrading for the prices they have. Plumbing problems outdated furniture. Great customer service excellent response to all needs. Dining very good food and best customer service security on site and prepared
20,"While the outside of the hotel is really cool and the lobby is beautiful there we so many ""features"" of the hotel that were misleading. They advertise amenities such as ""in room refrigerator"" however at check in they mention that you cannot take anything out or you will be charged for it (even if you intend to put it back) and if you put anything in you may be charged as well. If it is an amenity of the room it should be free. We bought our own waters and sodas with the intention of keeping them in the fridge and we couldn't do that. Plus while booking through Vegas.com we payed per individual and it said we would receive a $20 food and drink voucher which we then assumed was per person as well but it wasn't."
40,Loved everything about our stay with the exception of housekeeping that either knocked in the morning or entered even with the Privacy & No Housekeeping signs on the door. The staff keeps everything clean from the windows to the elevators to the machines.
20,My experience was Poor was not satisfied will not recommend to stay there!!! It was dirty felt stuffy not secure loud to enjoy your sleep. Valet wasn’t open had to walk from parking structure with all our luggage that is so unprofessional and inconvenient.
30,Upgrade to 25th floor not worth the price  Overpriced food per usual for Vegas  Clean & Safe  fast room service for towels  Ok view of volcano but windows needed a cleaning  Great location  Free mask gloves and hand washing station I thought was great due to covid
40,I actually been here before a month ago and I liked it a lot so I returned. They are reasonable and pretty clean. I only wish as they closed the pools and gyms they should charge you less for resort fees if at all.
10,The worst customer service ever from any hotel i have stayed at. Everyone made excuses as to why they were unable to do anything to change the situation. And the DONT CARE ATTITUDE i received was unacceptable
50,The hotel rooms and casino floor was clean staff on the playing table were very friendly and patient and good Vegas strip location. Pool area really nice and clean kid friendly as well if traveling with kids. If visiting check out the lions.
50,The room was very nice excellent view of the Eifel Tower/Paris at night. Staff was amazing super friendly check-in. Food Drinks and Experience was really fantastic. Enjoyed the Secret Garden and Dolphin Exhibit. The gaming was fun and the gift store/shopping was fun. Totally loved the experience staying at The Mirage Hotel & Casino!
40,Easy access to strip. Complementary parking. Staff is friendly and helpful. Great value for the money. Went for our son’s 21st birthday! Nice easy environment for families. In the future will stay there again
20,I watched 2 cocktail waitresses have a conversation 20 feet from where I was sitting....and continued to sit for an hour without ever being asked if I would like a drink.  Also my friend asked our waitress in The Still 2 times for ice to no avail. I went to the bar myself and got her some ice.  When booking online I requested a smoking room and was put on a non smoking floor. I didn't even stay. I will say the room looked comfy but that is all I can say about the Mirage.
20,Items were left behind by previous guest. With COVID I would have expected my room to be extra clean. I got a large suite and it was not as pictured. The picture showed a pool table. I was very disappointed!
40,I had to pick up my daughter in Arizona so we stayed one night on the way. The room was a great price clean nice staff and for a hotel a comfy bed. I wasn’t happy there was no coffee pot microwave or a fridge we could use. It was stocked with expensive items and we wanted a place to put our left overs from the night before.
30,I would say the room was nice. I had a 2 bedroom suite. The beds were comfortable. However the living room had a totally old sofa sectional. I’m not sure why it was even in the room. Half of the sectional was worn and sagging to the floor. Not cool to have a as an option for a 2 bedroom suite.
30,Staff doesn't know what the actual rules are when you are at the pool drinking. Very frustrating when you are taking a dip of your drink and have a security gal tell you to put your mask on. Talked to 2 different people and got 2 different replys.
50,Our stay at the Mirage was great! Had a beautiful room with an amazing view of the Strip! Love the location! Easy was to the Walgreens across the street and also to Casino Royale one of our fave casinos. Hotel was beautiful and clean. Would stay there again for sure!!
50,Very nice stay  i love the casino very clean. i would stay here again ... Very afforable nice staff. they got a stay well rooms as well  for a little bit more  the hotel gave me a 50 dollar resort credit it helped alot ;)
10,The condition of the room was not what I expected. The window to the outside was dirty and drain in the shower was nasty. The TV had a green line down the middle. The condition of the room was not worth the price paid.
50,The dealers and the pit boss in this casino were incredible! They made losing money fun! Lois was amazing and her team were funny enthusiastic and personable. We came to the Mirage daily just to play with them! Thank you for a great experience.
30,Great spot on strip room was alright - it was a little pricey we had the hospitality suite on 24th floor with strip view room was little dated but you're only in it to sleep. Freemont was best part.
40,Overall a very good stay with friendly staff. From check in with the bell hope to the check in process. Everything was smooth. Very clean with sanitizing high frequency areas. Very nice looking hotel.
30,Hotel is average the bed and pillows were the best thing about the room. slots are to pricey and they raise the price on their tables to high. The hotel is in a good location on the strip.  Mlife lied to me about rewards compensation.
10,There were so many other rude and/or unprofessional staff encountered during our stay with the exception of Freddie. The bellman Steve would not assist us with our luggage once he overheard me telling my traveling companion that I needed to get cash. The waitress at the SNACK restaurant overcharged me which I'm assuming was to include here tip. When I called to dispute the FRAUDLENT charge on my credit card after arriving home I was hung up on. I will call back and lodge a formal complaint.
10,I couldn't believe when we received a charge to our credit card for Refreshment Center Fee when we didn’t drink anything from it and then after trying several times calling your Guest Service phone number I was never able to speak to a human being and only email but never get it response.    I have one 2 years old son so I need storage for his milk then just take out the fridge items and put the milk in. They charge me $200 for this BS fee    This is not acceptable more so it is illegal to charge me for something that I didn’t consume and if what their voice machines “explained” to me it is correct it is not acceptable that no one from the staff would have explained this to me upon check-in and they don't have sign on the fridge.    I look forward to hear from the Management / Guest services Team to reply to an email I have sent or this comment.
50,I really enjoyed my stay at the Mirage. I believe they told me they didn’t carry my favorite drink to gamble with (midori sour) which is a bummer. I didn’t not spend much time gambling there because of this. But the location is great right in the middle of everything including all the food Vegas has to offer! The hotel rooms were good clean standard rooms. Elevators were easily accessible self parking is free and the rates are great! If you want to stay in the middle of everything and not feel like you’re compromising to get a good rate this is the hotel/casino for you.
50,I like the fact the mirage had individually wrapped masks at each entryway the other hotels I visited while I was there and casinos did not they had Mass but they were not wrapped. Also the pool area grotto and the front of the hotel are beautiful
10,I went through hell trying to cancel reservations. They wouldn’t refund me or send me any proof of my cancellation through email. I had to call over five times in a period of three weeks. Very unprofessional and unorganized. Never again .
50,The room was clean and housekeeping did a great job keeping it that way. The bell desk was helpful and extremely friendly. They did a great job ensuring that all guests were wearing masks (I know it sucks but it is what it is). We will definitely be back.
40,Clean and spaced. Easy to stay distant. Some restaurants are open the machines are distanced. Mirage is on the bus line which is nice and easy to get around the strip. We had a nice time and enjoy the volcano view
50,Efficient front desk check in . Was able to get to my room early instead of the 4 o’clock check in. Bell hop guys were nice too. Housekeeping did a superb job. Happy that security enforced mask wearing. I get safe
30,Stay Well room I stay in was much better that a regular room. Some small perks not much value! The housekeeper didn't do much cleaning just straighten up the room. Carpet was stained and the shower head had mildew.  Stayed 5 years ago and had a better experience in a king bed room.
50,Love this hotel. Went during the week so the price was great. Also location was perfect and close to everything. Great Hotel and will definitely return to this Hotel and Casino. My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary and glad we chosen this Hotel for our celebration.
50,This hotel was extremely fantastic I had so much fun here everything was amazing the hotel rooms were very spacious and very clean the staff was also very exceptional I had a wonderful time here EXCELLENT
20,When we got to the hotel we had to be switched out of our rooms twice before we were placed in an adequate room. The first room had a sink that didn’t work and there was a bug in the bathroom. The second room had curtains that were all shredded up and caked up dust on the counters that looked as if the room hadn’t been cleaned in months. Not what I expected out of a 4.5 star resort. This was the worst hotel experience We’ve had in Vegas and we travel there frequently.
50,Even with the Covid restrictions we had a great time. I was in a Resort Tower King room on the 25 floor. I had an elevator that went directly to the 24th and 25th floors. The lobby to the guest elevators is quite a hike. I am assuming because of Covid they removed places to sit and rest. I felt safe and secure plus masks are thankfully mandatory! If your mask is below your nose a security person is there to remind you to put it up! My room was very very nice! Huge windows overlooking the strip and volcano. A comfortable king bed with plenty of pillows. Big t.v. Plenty of places to hang my clothes and plenty of drawers. I didn’t find the safe in the room until I was going home! It is in the bottom drawer of a nightstand. The bathroom has two vanities a soaking tub and a separate shower. Be warned the hot water gets burning hot after a couple seconds. The main pool was closed but we took advantage of the pool that was open.  We went to see the white tigers and the dolphin show. I thought it was worth the money. The Mirage is pretty much accessible to the rest of the hotels and casinos on the strip. The staff was super friendly. The volcano goes off every evening at 8 9 10 11 make sure you see it at least once. If you want to go when more things are open and available go Thursday.-Sun. We went Sun.-Thurs. and it was not very crowed at all which we loved.
20,I was locked out of my room for five hours and the situation was handled poorly. Multiple trips to the front desk were taken although we kept explaining the issue. No one from management ever reached out to me about the issue.
10,The shower didn't drain at all. No room service in the entire hotel . Mini bar was stocked with minimum selections. Small amount of towels in the bathroom. The hotel in general just looked old and used up!
50,Great Customer Service Team! Very hospitable. Enjoyed dining at the eatery The Pantry! The staff was very friendly and courteous. We did encounter any real issues regarding noise. Relaxing time by the pool.
40,The resort is great but towards the edge of trip. Hard to walk the strip and make the way back. Overall a good pick but would recommend a car rental/ubering around for the sake of your feet! The staff was great and the individuals at the Pantry restaurant were great along with the members at MLife rewards! Resort was clean and there were sanitizing spots everywhere and security constantly reminding people to put their masks up!
30,Room was fine. Television did not work and each day we received 2 wash rags for a room for 4 people. Not sure how they figure that. They did get the TV repaired and said they would credit the resort fee for the day for our inconvenience but they did not. I didn't expect any compensation initially but don't tell me you're going to do something and then not do it. I was pretty disappointed and expected more from this property.
40,Great trip.... during Covid. Casino still has a large number of closed restaurants and attractions. I would HIGHLY recommend Otoro food is exceptional and atmosphere was very inviting. The STILL has many choices of food and beverage. From what I saw you really can’t go wrong here.
10,First the problem started before even checking in. I called there on Friday and spoke to the front desk and someone at the FedEx center asking them if I could get a packaged overnighted to me and get it Saturday they both told me yes. So after spending $50 dollars to get it sent comes Saturday and I can't get my package. They email me Monday after I checked out and let me know my package is there and to get it from them there is an additional$10 fee?! What does our resorts fee if we can't get a package sent to us without paying more.    Second issue is when I checked in the lady told me I couldn't check in using my debt card. That it had to be a major credit card. This was my 5th time to Vegas this year and never had a problem with using it before. Finally she lets me us it charges me a $300 deposit (I was at the MGM in September for a week and only was charged $100 deposit) and tells me since it's a debt card I can't use my food and beverage credit.
10,We stay there four nights the room wasn't clean we found used Qtips and used stained towel hanging on the shower curtain rod there was dust around and the carpet wasn't clean. If you are bring your kids you want to avoid this hotel.
50,Very relaxing and calm atmosphere. Perfect location on the strip. Everything was close by just a few minutes away from anything that you could possibly need. Check in was fast and easy as well as the check out you can check out through your TV room.
50,The Mirage is located dead-center strip. Wonderful place to call home-base whilst the availability of running around the city can put you right at ease. Wonderful staff everyone is helpful. Great time!
50,Thanks Mirage for entertaining our group during the Covid era. Despite the pandemic we had a wonderful time. Can’t wait to go back!!! The golf experience to Shadow Creek was best golf in my life (and I’m a golf professional)
30,The Mirage is in a great location and I have stayed at the property a few other times in the past. Unfortunately it's starting to show it's age. The rooms are a nice size but the chairs were old and dirty. The bathroom's grout and caulking needs to be replaced or cleaned appropriately. Despite Covid-19 our room was dusty under the furniture which was concerning. The property itself needed some better cleaning such as the elevators which had some stains on the metal walls. Vegas is hurting right now but I was disappointed in the number of table games that were open along with the higher betting limits. Because of this I sought out other casinos to meet my gambling needs. Mirage has lost some of its luster and I hope they spruce up the property to make it a preferred destination.
40,Good location mid strip. Rooms are comfortable but a bit dated. For all restaurants that are open you will need a phone that can scan a QR code. This will put you on a waitlist for the restaurant. Then another scan will give you the menu. Since I'm technology challenged this presented a bit of a problem for me.
50,Wedding Weekend with Family & Friends. Mirage is what I call home when in Las Vegas. Great rooms restaurants shops slots and gaming tables and sports rooms. Constant attention to players and drinks. Sad to see Buffet and some Entertainment venues closed due to Covid-19. Safe and Extremely clean due to pandemic. Abundance amount of Sanitizing Stations and Free Mask coverings.
40,Stayed at Mirage from November 6-10. Check in was easy. Staff did a great job at keeping machines clean. Ate breakfast at the Pantry twice. The French toast is a must. The only issue was the bed was extremely uncomfortable. Woke up with back pain every morning. Made some money on the slot machines.
50,This property does clean and safe right! From room cleanliness and Covid protection amenity bag to socially distanced gambling and dining! Can’t wait till next time and when Beatles Love is back! Keep it up and stay safe! Thank you!!
50,You can use the Mirage App to check in once you arrive. Felt very safe with regard to cleaning of machines and staff reminding visitors to keep their mask up. The bed was super comfortable and the room was clean. Check out is also a very simple process and there were no lines at any time.
50,The Mirage was very clean! Huge rooms- very friendly staff! The food served in hotel was delicious and decently priced for being in a resort in Vegas. I really enjoyed the cleanliness and space in my room.
30,Not strict enough sith mask enforcement. People were walking around and drinking at machines with no mask. Also people were smoking and blowing their smoke in the air. Smoking should be prohibited during the COVID crisis. People can go outside and smoke.  Outrages food prices with only a few restaurants open.
20,"Loud party across from my room that lasted all night long that forced my wife and I to check out at 4am because we couldn't stand it anymore. All the front desk could offer was ""sorry that it happened"""
30,We booked the Mirage for a weekend family trip with our 9 year old. We chose the Mirage specifically for the pool and hot tubs. I called prior to booking to confirm that the pool and hot tubs were open. I was assured they were. They were not open during our stay and the hot tubs had been closed for 8 months. I booked the room the same day we checked in so whomever I spoke with had to have known the hot tubs had been closed for a while. We felt tricked into booking here. The place was nice but we felt duped.
30,I feel like I wasn’t being treated fairly at the casino tables that was my first time staying at that casino and it Well be my last they try to be nice to me after I started gambling $500 a hand and that not cool
50,We had a great stay here for our birthdays. With the comped room and the resort credit it made it easier and fun to stay here. Very clean and well managed. They attended to most of our needs. I recommend staying here.
50,My family and I stay in Vegas one to two times a year. This was our first time staying at The Mirage and we loved it!! This was definitely not our last stay!!! Thank you guys for a wonderful experiences
40,Big rooms clean staff was honest and took care of the problem in other ways  Check in was good and smooth  Check out took longer  Restaurant food was good and good value for money  Good variety of food but missed the buffet
50,This is my favorite Vegas hotel centrally located. Clean friendly staff great restaurants. This always my go to hotel in Vegas. The pool is awesome! Wish we had better weather this past weekend to use it. Covid clean! Hand washing stations and hand sanitizers and masks available
10,You have a choice when it comes to staying at an MGM resort when visiting Vegas. The Mirage will leave you disappointed from the terrible customer service lack of cleanliness and less then friendly staff.
20,If you need a good meal stop there for a drink or atmosphere avoid. Staff either was being treated poorly or horrible management. People were rude and abrasive all weekend waiting around 40 minutes trying to get more service
40,Weekend getaway like the hotel room was very good clean casino well table are pricey weakened rates are steep pai gow table yes just one starts at 25$ Please open up more pai gow tables at 10-15$ per hand. I had to go to South point Hotel Casino to find 10$ tables (8 or more) of pai gow.Where as Mirage has one..
20,"The Mirage has a reputation as being a high quality establishment. Their table minimums certainly support that but the upgraded 21st floor room I had certainly didn't support that. It was small with a small window and it just had a dated feel. Would have been ""OK"" for a freemont street hotel and associated rates.  To be clear it was clean and everyone was friendly but just meh"
40,Good quality casino hotel with several good eateries (Carnegie Deli and a burger place) having been replaced in the past year. Used to have pretty good atmosphere during weekends but now OK atmosphere due to Covid.
10,TVs didn’t work. Mini fridge broken. Mini bar half way full. It’s like they don’t care too much of how they up keep there rooms. Stood at the pent house. When these concerns were addressed to the front desk the apologized and said they would send someone up to fix this. I had to call the front desk several times and during my entire stay could even watch tv in my room because no one came. I will never stay here again.
30,Was not impressed with the room quality. Seems run down and in need of attention. Bathroom door has been painted too many times to  Count and the furnishings bed carpet we’re past their prime. The shower was the worst shower head was horrible
50,I had a great time and I most definitely will be back I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family. I only experienced one issue with the bathroom smelling like wet towels that mildewed but other than that excellent
50,my girlfriend and l we make plans to get married November 2020 and both decide to stay on mirage for the excellent hotel service last year 2019 both stay at mirage and we choose to continue the tradition to come back to this magnificent experience thanks
40,I have stayed in numerous places in Vegas - i like to try different hotels just to experience them. Back in the ay Mirage was considered a luxury choice. Now it's more middle of the road. That said the rooms were exceptionally clean well updated and the property in generally is well maintained - if a bit dark (they really need a lighting refresh). If you can get a good deal it worth staying - especially with free self parking.
30,During times like these its important to remember that if you can figure out a way to set your company apart and rise to the top it will carry over into times when normal life returns. We had two couples traveling together and stayed in a two bedroom suite and unfortunately we didn't experience anything that set the Mirage apart from its competitors.
30,Resort fee does not provide anything other hotels provide automatically such as coffee in the room a microwave or a refrigerator that you can put your own items in rather than being forced to pay premium for items they prestock.
10,Room was cleaned decent. Backboard was ripped and hidden by the pillows not sure why they didn’t fix this? 2 of the hand towels had blood on them in the bathroom I believe the cleaning staff didn’t notice it.
30,The Mirage had no shows to offer most of the restaurants closed. So the stay was very boring. Prices where high for food in Mirage. Would recommend taking a short walk to the Fuel Bar. Was best part of stay in Vegas.
50,Great stay at the Mirage very clean and great service. Always a top notch property and in the perfect location. Took a self driving BMW Lyft ride down to see family at the NY-NY from the north entrance really cool. Will stay again soon!
50,Helpful staff extremely clean and well kept due covid 19 circumstances. Loved the dolphin exhibit. And the iconic volcano show. Also give the Heritage restaurant 5 stars . Perfect setting to celebrate my wife's and I wedding anniversary. Will be back very soon
40,Very friendly staff and clean room/hotel. The location of the hotel was very nice and the view from the room was pretty cool. The check in process went very smoothly due to the excellent front desk person we had and the bell service people were also very friendly.
50,Excellent stay nothing was wrong best Stay so far same thing at the slots everything was clean perfectly very clean hallways stayed at the flamingo in August did not like that sty for reason they were not cleaning rooms and you guys perfectly did
50,Very nice clean rooms and excellent customer service! They have a restaurant called PANTRY it has great food...... very fresh and appetizing went there for breakfast and lunch  the burger is OUTSTANDING! the potato wedges are also yummy.  And breakfast was also worth every penny I ordered the jackpot and everything was fresh and appetizing
40,The Mirage hotel is showing some signs of age especially when compared to Wynn/ARIA/Bellagio but it is still a nice hotel offering a lot of activities. The pool area is spectacular the restaurant choices are very good and the rooms are comfortable. The location is perfect with the Forum shops on one side and the Fashion Mall on the other. Wynn Venetian and Caesars are a short walk.
20,Lacks in Customer Service and quality. Our ac did not work the plugs to charge our phones did not work commode did not flush well and the water was always running. Customer service is lacking as the front desk is rude. Times listed for the restaurants change without notice. Choose a different property this one is lacking in so many areas!
40,Very good enjoyed my stay enjoyed the aquarium lovely pool. Volcano show was very good to experience. I loved the convenient location on the strip as well being next to caesars palace Venetian and forum shops and the grand canal shops. I was hoping to enjoy Diablos cantina but I guess they are not open during the week
30,Beds were hard food overpriced. Rooms need updated. Shower sucked. The Still was confusing as u order good from a truck and drinks from a waitress. Not sure who to tip. New elevator system was awesome felt safe from unwanted guest in hotel
20,Took out $500 in fees and deposits when I checked in. Housekeeping every other day you couldn’t pull the curtain on the cabana very few options on the pool menu pool closed at 4pm so I asked the lifeguard if it was because of covid he lied and said no it always closes at that time. I said no it doesn’t because I visit once to twice every year. I had just been to vegas this march. We needed to pay to have the drinks and snacks refilled which is usually included with the price. Im sure all the resorts have made cutbacks so I’ll stay at one of the cheaper resorts next time and make it worth the lack of amenities. Our rooms were overlooking a parking lot and someones car alarm kept going off the nights we were there.
50,The Mirage is located in a great central location on the strip. The casino floor offers a variety of slot machines. The property is very clean and the staff is helpful. The rooms are clean and the views from the room are amazing. We love a few of the restaurants at Mirage and there is a variety of choices from quick serve casual and upscale. Mirage does not disappoint!
40,Friendly staff plenty of dining and gaming options.The self parking is easily accessible and a close walk to the hotel lobby. The only drawback is the rooms are really dated and badly in need of an update.
50,Even though a lot of shows and other entertainment was still unavailable due to covid we still were pleased with the dinning and entertainment available within walking distance of our room. A quick cab ride and you could be anywhere on the stop. Our room was the most basic and it was comfy. They have windows you can open! Beautiful lobby and the Pantry's breakfast is a must. They have gluten free bread. Wonderful pool. Helpful staff.
50,This place is my favorite place to stay in Vegas. Its always friendly and clean. I was sad they still had no valet parking and no buffet but I understand its not by their choice. They go above and beyond to make our stay the best
10,Terrible! No refrigerator to keep your food cold! Hair all over the room and room service was terrible. I asked for extra towels and never received them. Staff wasn’t friendly. I will not recommend this place when visiting Vegas.
50,Highly satisfied with everything especially since we were there for 7 days will definitely be back and stay at the mirage again some of the nicest people we talked too compared to all the other hotels
50,Even wearing masks everywhere we enjoyed three days of fun and relaxation. We liked the layout of casino shopping and food areas very nicely done and staff everywhere to answer questions. Will stay there again.
50,My wife and I celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary In Las Vegas. Our stay at the mirage was MORE than we expected!! We stay 7 nights and every day was filled with something new and exciting to do!!
50,Reasonably priced hotel right in the middle of the strip Room was very nice and clean the bed was comfortable Staff was friendly and helpful and Great COVID Prevention  I would definitely stay there again
10,Good scene but not good if you enjoy playings slots no where in Las Vegas strip at all they’re all the same trying to rob those who been looking out for them for so long . Las Vegas is dead it will collapse
50,Beautiful hotel and casino. Well take care of and COVID Prevention to the highest level. Great stay. Will definitely be king back soon. The pool was great could of been heated a little more  but very nice.
50,I've stayed at Mirage 5 times previously and it's always superb. Prime location amazing pool excellent customer service at every turn rooms are slighty outdated but clean. I stayed at Harrah's my trip out 3mos prior as Mirage was closed. Boy was it good to be back! Harrahs was AWFUL and I will never stay anywhere else but the Mirage again. They make you feel like a VIP even though the rooms are very affordable for a 4 star hotel. Thanks again!!
50,This is a great reasonably-priced hotel right smack in the middle of the strip. Staff are super friendly excellent customer service. Rooms are nice and most importantly clean. Beds are nice and comfortable.
50,I come to Vegas every week from  LA to gamble I have tried Luxor Mandalay Bay mgm  but nothing compares to being mid strip in nice modern rooms. I highly advise staying here. They have an aquarium at check in! Lines can be boring
10,Slept on sheets that was never changed prior to my arrival... third night found dirty socks in the bottom of bed.... was comp my entire stay but I was sick to my stomach the rest of my stay because of it.
50,Service was outstanding. The slots were pretty tight but the rooms were clean and the staff very friendly. Good choice of dining spots. Even with the pandemic and everything not being open we enjoyed our stay. This is our first time staying here and we had a lot of fun. We will stay here again on our next trip out for the races October 2021.
50,The best spot on the strip! Pool area was awesome. I have so much respect for the staff who have to tell members to put on their masks. They did it so friendly and professional. Room was very clean and wS super comfortable.
50,Great stay! Very clean and everyone was very professional. As you go to your room they have a seal on the door to let you know that the room was sanitized. You also receive a free toiletry bag with a couple of nice masks as well as hand sanitizer. If your coming to party hard like the good ol days think again. Due to COVID many hotels are still closed restaurants not open and the strip was basically dead. The food was the biggest issue as in Vegas your used to getting any type of food at anytime. Not right now! The Pantry was about the only restaurant open in the mirage and it’s open till 11 pm. Decent food but well over priced $60 for 3 burgers and fries no drinks.
20,I just checked out after a 2 night stay. Upon entering my from I lifted the toilet seat to find it ‘encrusted’ from the previous guest. Disgusting.    Mistakes can happen so I called housekeeping to inform them and asked for the toilet to be cleaned.... and check the bath to make sure all surfaces are well cleaned and sanitized.    I left for an hour returned.... and the toilet was cleaned. Or so it appeared...    The next morning I pulled back the shower curtain to find long black hairS around the tub and filth in the corners. It was easily dislodged with a washcloth. Really gross!!    My room was NOT clean and my efforts to ask for assistance were not fulfilled.    I left the room and ordered a salad at the cafe next to Starbucks and watched the team member go through all the salads in the fridge. Something was wrong with the dates? She found one and I checked out.    As I was half finished with my chicken Caesar I saw that the date on the container was 4 days ago? Did it expire 4 days ago? Was it made 4 days ago?? Either way not good.    I spent my last night next door at Caesars. ;(    Covid has certainly dealt a blow to everyone especially Vegas. Nonetheless there’s no excuse for poor housekeeping.    Furthermore MGM makes a big deal of their Covid safe cleaning procedures including a ‘sealed’ door to showcase their sterilized rooms.    If the toilet is FILTHY tub disgusting and a return trio by housekeeping produces no real resolve.... how clean is my room!?    It’s not!!!    I’ll be back next week. I won’t stay at The Mirage!!!    Room 21018.
50,While staying at the hotel my family and I had an absolutely beautiful time. The location relative to everything on the strip is perfect. The amenities in the hotel left very little to be wanted. The only issue we had with our stay was the fact that we could only go to the floor that our room was on. Our family was unable to get rooms all on the same floor so this was frustrating. Otherwise I absolutely recommend.
50,We upgraded to a suite and it was so nice. Floor A one bedroom with a bar area living room huge bathroom walk in closet separate toilet room and dressing/makeup table. My husband loved the 3 TV. Especially the one at the foot of the king size bed.
50,Excellent place to stay you have to get the volcano view it’s amazing! The staff are great! I played and won and it was cool. All in all I would stay here again. The restaurant Pantry was great with great staff as well.
40,Overall a very nice casino. The only problem I had is with late night food. I’m out drinking till 2-3 in the morning and hungry you have to leave the casino to get food. I know probably just because of the COVID-19 but having to walk down the strip to Caesars to eat one night and across the street into another casino for the Subway sucked. Mirage has a eatery called Snacks which says Open 23/7 but it’s not true. They closed before I got in every night and didn’t open back up till 10am. 😢. I would still stay here again once everything back to normal.
30,Room is good size but restroom is too small for two people. Rooms are loud we were woken up every morning to loud talking in hallways & slamming doors. I prefer a room with less sound more private and bigger restroom.
40,We really enjoyed our stay at the Mirage! Everyone courteous and helpful! I really enjoyed my comfy bed and pillows! I slept well after being out all day and night! The hotel could use some renovations and upgrades but overall satisfied!
40,We got a great deal on a room at the Mirage and were pleasantly surprised with a super soft bed and fluffy pillows to rest our weary bodies. Online check in was super fast and MGM had plenty of above and beyond services with COVID. The only negative was that we stayed on the 2nd floor and got robbed of the amazing views of the strip amd instead got to see a dead bird on a roof. All in all the Mirage was a great place.
50,I've stayed here numerous times when in Vegas and keep finding myself coming back. It's a very nice clean Resort with many options from dining to gaming. In the pool and my opinion is one of the best on the strip
30,Circuit breaker doesn't work in room 1850! And I forgot a brand new $700.00 wallet in my room and it was stolen! I called when we left but was told to call the following day and was told it wasn't in there!
50,This was my birthday and it made me feel great  I will definitely come back and stay at this hotel/casino  I love the quick & friendly check in and  The lovely view I had from the window of my room  Parking was also exceptional
50,The hotel was clean and staff was great! I loved that you could not go into the elevator without a room key . That made me feel safe . I loved the location in the strip. I was in the heart of all the best hotels and shopping areas.
50,Extremely satisfied with their outstanding customer service. Strongly recommend this hotel if you wanna to receive remarkable customer satisfaction clean room good food and fast room service. I would be definitely staying again.
40,Awesome weekend at the Mirage. Great staff and great value for a fun weekend! Convenient hotel to stay at if you want to walk around the strip. The pool was awesome to end my weekend in Vegas! Very friendly staff that cater your needs.
40,This trip was for sure a quick turnaround. I honestly thought that the room was going to be a lot better than expected. But I can’t be mad for the price I paid. It sufficed for our trip. There were a few issues with the room but overall it worked out it. It wasn’t like we were going to spend the whole trip in the room.
30,Clean room but things inside don’t work. They didn’t hurry to get anything fixed. Pre-Covid this was our favorite place to stay but it seems as though they don’t care now. I’m a patient person but this stay took the cake. To top it off it was a Penthouse Suite.
50,Covid protocols were followed. Not all venues are open. The room was clean and the staff were friendly they did stay on top of requiring masks be worn. Getting a beverage during the week while playing slots was nearly impossible but there were more staff working on the weekend.
50,The room was extremely clean and had a sticker on the door verifying that it was cleaned and sanitized. Also some slot machines were turned off to promote social distancing and employee enforced the mask policy.
50,I totally enjoyed my stay at The Mirage. From the mobile check in to the easy check out on the TV it is a very efficient system. ALL of the Mirage Staff were kind & accommodating. I requested a Volcano Room & had a wonderful view of the volcano & the strip.
50,Overall great experience. All amenities were great. Maybe if I had to suggest something it would be a higher enforcement of covering mouth and nose from people wearing masks at the casinos. But overall I had a great at the Mirage
40,Nice hotel. Enjoyed the nature/jungle themes. Dolphin show was amazing and worth time and money. Easy online check in. Rooms were clean but average. No mini fridge to use. Bathrooms could use a small upgrade.  Overall solid hotel and location.
30,I chose to come to Las Vegas to celebrate my 60th birthday. This was my first time to Las Vegas. I was in tears and disappointed with the Mirage Hotel. The manager gave my guest $100 food voucher but that did not compensate me as the comp and birthday guest.
50,Pool was great saw the dolphins and tiger's. Will stay again next year! Easy access to the strip. Enjoyed the volcano.  Close to the other hotels and casinos. Hopefully everything will be open next time.
20,Was double charged room booked was unavailable at check-in refrigerator locked and therefore unable to use. Staff not understanding and made our visit feel us at fault for misfortunate experience. At bag hold staff had no sense of urgency after we specified we were in rush to get to airport and never bothered to even get off her seat to even try and attend to our needs.
50,It was definitely different with less people there and not all of the attractions available but still a tremendous visit. We will be booking the Mirage again in the future. Hopefully next time we can hit it big!
50,Had the kids 25snd 24 years old. Stay at Mirage. They loved it. I was across the st. At Venetian. Perfect. I did most my gaming at mirage That alone tells a lot about this property. They also offer a lot of comps after you play there once  Perfect stay
40,Aside from the fact that I checked in early through the MGM app I was told that I couldn’t change my room. Aside from being penalized for this everything else was great. You figure through a pandemic the staff would go above and beyond to accommodate but sadly that wasn’t the case.
30,Make sure your flight isn’t early because you won’t have a room  And they don’t give free drinks while  You gamble and you have to  Ask for a blanket .the Venetian is across the street and the palazzo they give free drinks while you gamble
50,This is my favorite hotel in the heart of the Strip! It is always clean and comfortable. This is probably my 10th time staying here and it never disappoints. I will stay here again when I return for sure!
50,Check-in went smoothly all staff was helpful and welcoming room was comfortable and CLEAN privacy was met! Definitely stay here again! I’d definitely recommend many friends and family members to stay
30,Room was decent for the price . Beds were stiff not soft . Bathroom was not updated seemed old. The window being able to open was a nice feature. That had a good bar with a dj on Saturday night . Loved the vibe
20,The bed was comfy but the pillows sucked! Their website said that you get a comp room upgrade from Sun-Thursday didn't get that. We were also told when we checked in that we would get a $50 food and drink credit if we used the restaurants inside the Mirage didn't get that. The drain inside the shower wouldn't drain and we called it in twice. The last time it looked like they used one of our clean towels to wipe out the drain and then left it. The casino was very good to me. There are plenty of hand sanitizer but when you walk around inside with a drink or are smoking you can take off your mask. If they get shut down again they will know why! I will stay elsewhere next trip!
30,The check in process was lengthy. The rooms need to be updated.Television was small. No late night snack places open. Housekeeping was good about coming at anytime to clean the room. Housekeeping staff was nice.
40,Hotel service was excellent. Cleanliness was perfect!  The only reason it’s not a 5 star rating is because the beds and pillows are extremely uncomfortable. Very hard and stiff nit firm but old. Other than that great hotel.
20,I have stayed at this property before when it was a nice premier place to be! Not this stay workers not happy rooms neglected & not cleaned to covid standards food options limited with no food available in the late night hours not even room service! Gaming floor not frequently cleaned nor maintained all in all very disappointing & we will not be back
20,Walls too thin. Very loud acoustics especially when door slams. Channels went In and out! Very good location however. Guess staff were friendly. My primary issue was the noise from neighbors due to bad acoustics/poor insulation/thin walls etc
50,Clean rooms masks enforced and great staff!! Great place to stay and play! Right on the strip too! I’m not a gambler but there’s still so much to do. Nice pool with lifeguards and bar. Child friendly area too
10,Mirage has manipulated the casino tables to give the house better odds. Added another “Mirage” slot in addition to 0 & OO but Payout odds remain the same. Craps table has added 11 and 12 as point number to make the game unplayable. $25 limits on a Monday morning? Staff acted like a policing force rather than customer service. RIP MGM and Vegas. If you live in Vegas think about that when choosing a Governor.
50,My family and I stayed in the Tower Suite and it was amazing!! I wish it had a microwave and a better fridge but I we were still satisfied. We will definitely come back here and I highly recommend this hotel and room.
10,We experiencing the worst peak of the COVID-19 pandemic yet your “safety measures” are sloppy irresponsible and woefully inadequate. I’m sure MANY people are being infected on your property then they travel home and spread it to their communities. There is absolutely no excuse for this kind of carelessness. People’s lives are at stake.    Your website says people’s temperatures are checked when they enter but that is NOT true. I was there 4 days and I only occasionally saw someone with a thermometer and they only checked people who entered the hotel check-in line so at BEST the only people who are temp-checked are those who go thru that line which is likely a small fraction of people who enter the property and at MOST those people are only temperature-checked when they first check-in not on any subsequent days. Plus if you check in on your phone which is highly encouraged your temp isn’t checked at all. In the 4 days I was there my temp was checked exactly once. Inexcusable.    Also every day I saw many people not wearing masks or with masks dangling off their ears or below their noses. I estimate that at least 10-15% of people were freely breathing coughing shouting and laughing their germs all over the place and no one told them to put their masks on properly.    I stayed at the Wynn in September and their COVID protocol was FAR superior. Every individual who enters is temp-checked every time (as it obviously should be) and everyone wore a mask. Just because you offer cheap rooms and cater to a low-end clientele that is no excuse not to take proper safety measures. Everyone has a right to be safe even if they’re not paying hundreds a night.    Finally I know all the hotels do it now but adding more than 50% to the room rate in the form of a “resort fee” is TOTAL BS. Seriously my room rate was $86 and the resort fee was an additional $44... so the ACTUAL rate is $130 - more than 50% higher than advertised. There are few if any “amenities” that can be safely enjoyed right now so it is inexcusable to force people to pay this exorbitant fee for which they get virtually NOTHING in return.    I felt very unsafe at The Mirage. For all I know I’ve been infected. I guess I’ll find out soon enough. Also the property is really starting to show its age. My room overlooked the roof of the casino and there was literally a giant tornado of garbage flying around. The whole place feels dirty and rundown. It’s definitely not what it used to be.
50,Mirage is a great property with lots of history. Great location to explore the strip from. Go check out the alley between Flamingo and LINQ. Mirage always smells GREAT when you walk in from valet area. Hidden gem is the Sigfreed and Roy Garden. Lots of good reasons to stay at the Mirage
30,Our stay at the Mirage was fair. It had been a while since I have stayed in Las Vegas however one thing I never forgot while staying on MGM properties was excellent customer care. Maybe it is a sign of the times but that detail seems lost these days.  The rooms were comfortable enough but my biggest complaint is with the allowance of yelling and constant door slamming.  It seems that a group in the next room also had members of their party across the hall. Unfortunately they treated this setting as an opportunity to let their family run back and forth yelling and slamming the doors. My family and I are often patient not wanting to make issue and giving things a chance to settle. However my own 10 year old daughters wondered if it was some kind of joke that what was going on was allowed. No one in our room was able to sleep with this constant disturbance. Needless to say we called down to see if we can get a late check out due to this inconvenient situation hoping to get a little rest before our trip home. However we were told that we would be charged for a later check out regardless of the reason. Reluctantly they finally did send someone up to inform the other guests to refrain from slamming the doors. I imagine other people complained as well. Our call was in no way demanding we just wanted a chance to get a little rest. It was very disappointing to say the least.
30,Many things were told to US during check-in and then afterwards they countered and told us they couldn't including accessibility toilets. We called multiple times before and after check in the assured us that the toilets could be made color for handicapped families. Once we checked in and requested it they told us they no longer could because they were already compliant
40,I am not a regular to Las Vegas but went for business and stayed at the Mirage. Our room was clean and we felt that the service kept it clean and were very attentive. I do dislike that (many of the hotels) you have to walk through the casino and past the shops to access the elevators for the rooms. I understand why this is done but when you walk SO much in Vegas anyway - at the end of the day that LONG walk to the elevators is just ugh. Everyone was very friendly anywhere we went in the hotel. If I come back to Vegas I'd certainly consider another stay here.
50,Hotel was very clean. They had great safety protocols for covid 19. My wife and I are both sensitive to cigarette smoke but we barely could smell any smoke in the casino area. We were very impressed with everything.
10,Checkin was terrible. The mirage took $1000.00 of our money that was needed for our 10 year anniversary trip to Vegas. Finally talked to manager and he acted like we were lying because the mirage had no record of 3 duplicate charges.me and my wife dealt with at frustration our whole stay and still dealing with it. As far as the gambling goes I have seen better payouts at convenience store in georgia
20,The Mirage has a good location. However we found service to be not up to the mark. A casino server/waitress was straight out rude to me and my wife. Could not enjoy a warm bath because bathtub water stopper did not work and water kept draining. Housekeeping entered unannounced in our room second day thinking the room was empty (checkout). Cannot not use fridge to save water or store leftover food better remove these useless fridges to save electric cost. Additionally no microwave in the room meant we had to eat cold food from last night. The room windows were very dirty with visible dirt and water spots. The Bare and Zoo/Aquarium not discounted for the guests.
50,Super pleased with The Mirage. We were in town for a quick weekend to get married. The hotel was pristine. Check in was easy staff was super accommodating and helpful. Everything was very clean and smelled so good. Masks were enforced.
30,The rooms were spacious the staff was friendly and the hotel overall was very clean. I enjoyed my view of the Strip and the nightly volcano show that was displayed right outside my window. Like most of the hotels on the Vegas strip the hotel had a casino a few restaurants one overly priced tattoo shop and 2 boutiques that didn't carry much. My stay was comfortable and I have no complaints about my room but I will say that my hotel didn't have much to offer. Unless I was taking a shower or sleeping I spent most of my time at other hotels such as Caesar's Palace and the Venetian.    There is no free parking I did not see a pool (but I also wasn't looking for it).  For a young couple or group looking to have a great time this is not the hotel for you.
20,Hotel amenities were few. Customer service average. I wont be staying there in the future.resort fee not worth it. Rooms and beds were average. Staff and customer service were average . Unhelpful at the front desk.
40,This was my second stay at this property and I am impressed with the cleanliness and almost all of the staff. Most are proud of their jobs and value it enough to be long time employees. If you have stayed here in the past and not enjoyed it for some reason this is a great time to try it again.
50,The customer service was great. The only thing that I didn't like was the AC in the room. It didn't seem like it was getting cold enough but it definitely wasn't a major problem. I would just prefer it to be colder. Other than that the stay was great.
30,We were at the Mirage one year ago pre Covid and the hotel was in a cleaner state than it is now. Also the marijuana is out of contol on room floors the hallways were fjll of it and making its way into the room
20,The place was dirty and the meal prices were very expensive. $140 for four at the breakfast diner. We were gouged and taken advantage of as there were no other places to eat but Starbucks. Every place at the Mirage was very expensive. We ended up leaving early and moving over to a beautiful resort where it was much more affordable and clean and nice. We will NEVER return to the Mirage.
50,Overall a great trip. We have stayed here before. Always a great stay. I don't think we can stay anywhere else. Staff always nice and the never any waits at the restaurants. Will recommend all the time.
30,We had a long check in process due to computer issues  room was nice but bath was small lots of noisy guests in hallway after midnight every night.. Food is very expensive and slots were very tight. I would do this again.. Better to stay off strip lots of crime on strip during this period
20,Bathrooms were horrible with mold on shower tiles. Pool servers say shots are cheaper to sell them and are triple the price at the end. This resort use to be amazing but sadly the rooms are run down now. Room rate PLUS $45 nightly resort fee added stay at another Vegas resort.
50,The Mirage is solid choice when considering where to stay in Vegas. The restaurants are exceptional. The staff is very accommodating. The property is very clean and well maintained. The hotel is centrally located to both shops and other attractions.
50,Consistently my favorite place to stay. Clean beautiful property and they keep the rooms fresh and updated. My only grip is that the hotel rooms are 100% Non-smoking as a smoker I would like the option for smoking.
40,Great location  awesome pool    Cleaned room but very small bathroom need some remodel    Pricy for essentials items $(7.58 for a toothbrush)    No access to the mini fridge in the roo  Dues to stocked beers and wines    No coffee maker in the room    Smaller casino area
50,Clean. Friendly. Great place to stay. This was our 10th time staying at The Mirage always great. Many hotels on the strip could learn a few things from The Mirage on how great it’s run. You won’t be disappointed.
10,There was no hot water in my room.It took them hours to fix our hot water.The manager Adama made us pay for a full  Price room after we checked in a few hours before check in time for a additional night.
30,Hardrock was better but since it no longer exists I’m trying to find a good replacement. Well the Mirage was not it. The air did not work properly and the hotel was a little dirty. We were there for 4 days and the same drywall dust and paper laid in the hallway during the entire trip dispute being walked over dozens of times by hotel staff. If they put this little of effort into vacuuming a pile of dirt in the hall I really question how much effort they are putting into cleaning the rooms. Especially with Covid-19 in the news and their “sevens step” promise.
30,Our first stay didn't quite meet expectations. The General Manager Rachel reached out and addressed our concerns and invited us back. Room was just ok. We were on the 23rd floor and far away from elevator. No maid service for two days but the hotel staff were very friendly and we really appreciated the mask kits that were in the room. Very nice touch.
50,I will stay here everytime i come to Vegas.Everything was perfect I had no problem at all. Staff all in the hotel was very friendly and helpful.The view was everything and more. I just really enjoyed myself
50,The staff was very friendly. A little wait for the restaurants due to Covid-19. The food was wonderful in both restaurants we went to.  The pool had many area's to hang out & the hot tub's location was wonderful.
40,Overall my stay was wonderful concierge made it easy to find things front desk made it easier to check in and out overall I had a great experience and would only to suggest upgrading the rooms a bit but love it
10,Good service and staff but the hotel policy of no microwaves or fridges is terrible. Hotel room description is not accurate. If you enjoy a 15 foot by 30 foot box then get the suite. It is small and not like the description at all
40,I assume that the new trend in roulette is the triple “0” wheel. I loved this casino in the past for having the European wheel which has a single “0”. Unfortunately it seems like the “000” is being pushed and I was forced to look elsewhere. Other than that the casino floor had good dealers and my wife loved the selection of slots.
40,Had a very good time would could anytime and was near everything and was able to experience the whole scenery of the strip and the service was real good and the Rooms was very nice and I love the volcano water fire show outside the mirage.
50,The staff at the front desk casino and restaurants were great. We walked the strip one night and visited many Casinos. Mirage by far had he best atmosphere of any casino. We are already planning our next trip to Vegas and we will be staying at the Mirage again.
50,Service was great the accommodations was super. The food was good. The slots (something I play) were tight; lost a lot of money. I never saw anyone win jackpots though hits were minimal. I heard tables were nice. The waitresses were good about accommodating fluids as needed. Had I not had a physical disability this year I would have walked more to other casinos. I found slots at Mirage to be quite repetitive in games. In that case it was a little disappointing. After four days I was expecting at least one jackpot but instead lost more than I started.
30,This was a needed trip and after traveling all day I got to check in and was given the complete run around. I was truly disappointed and tired. I checked in to only get in the shower that didn’t work.
40,My stay at the mirage was good. Everyone was nice the from the front desk and housekeepers were very welcoming. The only thing I didnt like was the room was a little bit small. Overall a good experience.
40,Nice room clean modern - A good location on the Vegas strip. a long wait for room to become available. Resort fee is very expensive. Staff is friendly and helpful. Long lines at hotel desk and at restaurants.
30,Average hotel for the price. Upon arrival no King rooms available. Had to call to get wash clothes replaced. Not all restaurants opened for service. Didn’t go to the pool or spa. Staff were friendly and helpful
10,"From check in to room to leaving. Staff does everything to avoid people/ guess it must be the covid 19 effective. distance don't talk and don't see// For a place wanting business and ""advertising we are open.. acted like they just wanted to be left alone."
30,Came here in August and got an amazing room with a strip view ( i was upgraded to the stay well suite free of charge ) loved it! Nice bathroom and not to close or far from elevators.  Only downside was the pool waitlist was in full play and i didn’t get to swim.    I went back last week and while i got to use the pool and LOVED It. I was given a pretty rough-Ish room. While i did get a partial pretty pool view it was a obvious downgrade from the stay well this hotel is older so these small room upgrades are sorely missed when not present. A glass door shower and some upgraded shower heads and carpet removal would really make this place a 10/10. May rebook for thanksgiving break if The nicer rooms aren’t too expensive.
50,We stayed Oct 17-21. The weather was amazing! The hotel was absolutely beautiful. It was very tropical and the waterfalls were gorgeous! The pool was very nice with huge waterfalls as well. The volcano was pretty awesome and better than I thought it would be!  Truly a lovers paradise!
40,Checked in at 1500 and our room was not ready. An upgrade was offered at $150 extra per night which we did not think was appropriate.  Room was clean and comfortable (if you like a FIRM bed otherwise be prepared to feel like you're sleeping on a wooden table lol) a travel pouch with two cloth masks hand sanitizer and a metal door opener was provided.  Buffet is closed and restaurants are operating with reduced menus and operating hours. The Pantry had yummy food but the service was just ok. It was disappointing to see a Manager mistreating one of the workers at the entrance of the restaurant.  Costa restaurant was just wonderful. The food was delicious and the service impeccable. Make sure to order the focaccia with burrata appetizer. You will not be disappointed. They also provided us small satin bags in which to place our masks while having dinner. I thought it was a nice touch.  Vegas is not its usual self but if you go with realistic expectations its still a lot of fun.
50,Had a great stay at the Mirage! The hotel was very clean the staff was friendly and helpful. The food at the hotel was yummy and the location was perfect. I'll definitely stay there again. Looking forward to going back.
10,Dirty rooms! Broken shower spray.  Blood stained sheets from previous person! Stayed 3 nights sheets never replaced! Unacceptable experience! The only thing they did was to return the resort fee which doesnt make any sense!!
50,Our family of 3 had a great 3-night stay at The Mirage. FYI: the lobby Starbucks opens at 6am. The Pantry (our best breakfasts of our trip) opens at 7am. Denny's across the street is 24-hours McDonalds across the street opens at 6am. My family is from 2 time zones away and wanted breakfast at 4am so that's how I know all this info.    More helpful info: unlike at Disney World resorts where the mini-fridge in the room is empty and you are encouraged to stock it with your own items if you even MOVE anything in their fully-stocked mini-fridge there are electronic sensors for each item and you probably will be charged when you check out. We had unknowingly moved some things around so we could keep our own stuff cold and had an extra $130 charged to our bill upon check out. Thankfully they took off the charges when my husband explained our error.    What was nice about our room is that there are 4 huge pillows on each bed (bring your own pillow if you need a flat or low-profile one especially with kids) real glass tumblers (4 of them) and they provide you with a set of complimentary face masks - and not some cheap disposable ones. These are high-quality washable fabric face masks and the paper insert describes the microns it filters the quality of the fabric the number of washes it can be used for (50) etc. and have a nice woven Mirage logo in the corner. They are awesome. Also they give you a good-sized tube of hand sanitizer for your use.    Our bathroom was outfitted with a very flattering main-mirror lighting and one of those lighted swing-out magnifying mirrors where you can see every pore and prevent any makeup error you may make. In addition the hot water went from hot to scalding very quickly so be careful. We loved the hot water and the excellent high water pressure in both the sink and the shower.    There was a crack in the sink which at first looked like a long hair but wasn't. The TV does not have many channels (we wished it had more kids channels and wished it had HGTV).    Overall we really enjoyed the hotel and felt very safe with all the health-safety measures that were in place throughout. If you are driving right now the parking garage is free. Save time and park on Level 4 where the short walkway to the hotel is.
40,Beautiful property with very clean rooms. The volcano show is a must see. Bathrooms are small in the guest rooms. The beds are very firm. Mobile Check in is a breeze. The digital keys take some getting used to. The atrium off of the main entrance is a sight to see.
10,We had a suite and we were not confident it was properly cleaned. People cut us off from the line and the concierge said nothing. Staff need more training. Delivered a roller bed to the wrong suite. Then called and took nearly 2hrs to get it. We were tired and couldnt wait. Then were woken up in spite of the signs that said do not disturb. We didnt even use the bed since it got to us late
40,I felt like I should’ve been offered to a great upgrade I paid almost $600 for apparently the basic of the basic from and it was so far from the elevator the room just seemed up dated and not modern didn’t even have a mini fridge 🤦🏽‍♀️
20,My wife and I arrived at the Mirage on October 11th and checked out on the 14th.  When we arrived we were told the room wasn't ready even though we payed for the $40 early check in.  The we asked for the manager all of a sudden the room was ready so I asked for a pool view like we always do and guess what? The pool view is now considered a premium view so you have to pay extra per day for that view. We asked for the manager again and he or she didn't even come out but they waived the fee. Now we get to the room and right away we noticed toe nail clippings all over the carpet we called the front desk and they moved us to another room. We check into the new room my wife went to shower and the pipe that is connected to the shower head has a leak in it and the entire bathroom got soaked!!! I wrapped a towel around the pipe and we just tolerated it for the next 3 days. The staff is not what they use to be at the Mirage it is clear that they are not happy and not wanting to be there and zero customer service skills!!! The rooms are run down and the hotel is definitely showing its age. I have always praised the mirage but its sad to say that I cant do that anymore and after 20 years its sad to say we will never go back there!!!!
50,My new favorite hotel love the mobile check and Digital key as it made check in a breeze. My room was very clean and the staff was very nice and professional. Mirage has a great pool and love the size of the pool area and the pool seemed heated. I will definitely return to The Mirage
30,We arrived on a Friday evening. Checked in. No explanation of amenities dining options at all.  Got to our room on the 9th floor. Room 9-098  Bathroom light didn’t work.  Called down and was told to push the button in the outlet. So I did and it worked then the breaker would blow shortly after. There was long black hair (I am blonde) as well as pubic hair on the ceiling of the bathroom.  The bathtub was worn through in an area  Window track very dusty  Room service is only from 7am to 3pm  There was mask station hand washing stations set up but no one walking through sanitizing like some of the other casinos had
30,The hotel was pretty for a sleep and go type. Our issue is Our room doesn't get cold and one of our beds are broken and the faucet on our room doesn't get cold its just stock on hot water and when we change room its still the same the room are warm were following what they say that you have to lock the door inside which we did and still the room are warm. Which is not good for a hot state. But the staff are great.
40,The overall hotel is nice. Bathroom can use a renovation. Other than that pool is great location of the hotel is one of the best! Right in the middle of the strip. Outside of the hotel is also the nicest with all of the water.
20,"They have cut back services so far that if you want simple amenities like food at night (ie 11pm) room service your out of luck. A handful of places open for a VERY few hours each day. PLUS In spite of being ""sanitized"" window in a 25th floor strip view room was filthy shower and tub in desperate need of a serious scrubbing AND caulk. Can say bedding was clean as well as public areas and most of the staff friendly so adding a star for that."
50,Its a nice hotel with a lot of options going on from restaurants to entertainment and playing options.  Its very luxurious and the staff is very laid back with their attitudes. You still get a casual feel about being there
50,Everything was excellent. Only issue was charged for items in fridge that were not missing I never used fridge except to store I food box. Otherwise had a lot of fun loved the pool and bartender was excellent.
40,When we got into our room we realized the A/C was shaking the panel it was behind and rumbling quite loud. Front desk offered us a different room with no view so we declined and was told someone was going to come fix it and ultimately that never happened. Our bathroom vent stopped working after the 3rd day and started screeching. We did get most nights comped so I can’t really complain about free rooms. Housekeeping was very friendly and The Mirage is a great location on the strip.
10,First room had a very slanted floor. walking uphill or downhill in the room. Second room had a flood from the ceiling in the bathroom. we had to move to third room in the middle of the night. Third room housekeeping kept knocking on the door every 30 minutes are you checking out even though we had late check out.
50,Well laid out with friendly staff and top notch amenities! There's limited staff for dining and gaming. While it will take time to get this back what is there is great! We have had fun at the Mirage for over a decade.
10,We stayed here as our first outing since COVID. We were extremely excited to be in Vegas as it’s one of our favorite places to be. However this trip was not what we paid for! Our shower in our room wouldn’t drain nor would the sink and there were whiskers on the shower curtain and sink. The next morning we went down to the lobby to get a new room. We even paid for an upgrade to make sure it was better. When we told them about our room ... all we got was an “I’m sorry” our suite that we upgraded to .. smelt like weed and for us to get the smell out we had to buy a room spray and spray it for 2 days!! Upon our departure I had left something and reached out to them and even filed a lost and found report and I have still yet to hear anything back!! We checked out almost 2 weeks ago!!! They got their money and that is all they care about!! We will NEVER stay here again nor will we recommend it to anyone. Sad that one hotel stay can ruin your whole trip.
30,Upon arrival everything was good until we got to our room and the bathroom light wasn’t working.I called the front desk several times nothing was done until I saw housekeeping in the hallways.Thank you housekeeping for getting the lights back on and no more showering without lights.
30,"We found a great deal on the 2 bedroom penthouse suite and just couldn't resist. We met up with another couple for a fun filled 3 days in Las Vegas. I will start with the positives - the hotel is clean and felt safe. Hand sanitizer/mask stations found easily throughout the hotel staff all wearing masks correctly and doing a good job of reminding guests. We did see housekeeping regularly cleaning public areas - however not sure how often elevator interiors were wiped down and found guests regularly willing to squeeze into an elevator with 4 people already inside. Not all the restaurants were open (understandably) but finding out what was open and when was not easily done - many times the various pages of the website were not working and we found the signage outside the restaurants to be unclear at best.    Now regarding our 2 bedroom penthouse suite (D-16). After a check-in challenge (the previous guest requested/was granted late check-out which caused us not to get to our room until after 5:30pm) we found the correct bank of elevators for the top 5 floors of the hotel. We walked into our huge room and immediately noticed how ""tired"" the room looked. The colors were dated the furniture chipped/worn baseboards dirty (and I don't mean dusty) and sloppy mopping along the walls (could see dried dirty water marks anywhere there was tile). We proceeded to check out the sleeping rooms - the room to the left when you entered was fine - nothing too fancy - large enough for a king size bed and an interesting chaise type chair. Then we headed to the room the right - this room was huge - massive bathroom walk in closet separate WC separate shower and jacuzzi tub. On the surface it was all good but it was strictly surface. Upon closer look this room had no accessible power in the sleeping area and no clock. The TV cabinet at the foot of our bed may have been broken as it looked like the TV should be able to be raised and lowered - we tried all we could and never did figure out how to make the TV disappear. in the main living space the TV would get a dark cast over it - we tried everything to restore the brightness - but the remote had no way to access this and we found no buttons on the side of the TV to help fix it. There were 2 mini fridges - one holding the usual assortment of mini bar provisions the other empty - however the empty one barely got cold. Our group of 4 sort of laughed it all off - imagining the number of parties (of all types) the room has likely seen. Another note - the first morning of our stay as we headed to the elevators we were hit by a cloud of marijuana smell - it was fresh it was big and it lingered - housekeeping was out in full force so they couldn't have missed it - have to wonder if they contacted security/management of this guest violation.    Again - we loved the size and space of the 2 bedroom penthouse suite but really wish it had felt more up to date and the larger of the 2 bedrooms had been properly outfitted for guest comfort."
40,Location couldn’t have been better. There were plenty of food options other than the casino within a quick walk.    The rooms are average bathrooms are insanely small we had no air all three nights we stayed. They said they’d send an engineer up but never did.
50,I would like to stay here again. The location of the hotel is in the strip. It was close to other hotels. This hotel had a secrete garden we were able to see the Dolphins and take pictures with them.
50,Gambled quite a bit. Found some good VP machines outside The Parlor Lounge. Food was excellent as well. Egg’s Benedict at the Pantry is awesome. Blizz frozen yogurt a nice treat after the pool. The highlight was Heritage Steak by Tom Collichio. We had the NY strip and bone in ribeye and they were cooked to perfection. Highly recommend the truffle risotto. The pool was a blast as usual. Clean with good music and drinks. Also the one bedroom tower suite was incredible. As big as our apartment with stunning views of the strip. Can’t wait to be back!
30,Hotel is a little outdated as expected. But I feel they could’ve done a little better in the room. Traveled with 4 other couples and all had a similar experience. The Hotel/Casino is still very nice. But out room had some issues. The curtains were torn and seem to be stuck together. The bed had a stain on the sheet and the bedding was also torn. Spoke to the front desk and the bedding was changed immediately. They really couldn’t do anything with the curtains I’m guessing because they weren’t changed. Overall didn’t let that mess up our get away. All the staff are very friendly. The Hotel also makes sure they and the guest are following guidelines. They are trying very hard to keep the guests safe during these crazy times.  Would I stay here again? Maybe
50,Best hotel on the strip. The atmosphere service are second to none. The pool is the best in Vegas.  The casino and staff are wonderful. The slot machines were kept clean and wiped down. There was plenty of hand sanitizer throughout the casino and staff made sure no one was violating mask policy. Felt safe
20,The servers at the casino were terrible they are not even checking body temperature anyone can walk into the casino some people were not even wearing a mask the overall experience was okay. When we arrived they told us they were going to put us in the old rooms but when we made the reservation they didn’t promote that they made us pay an additional $20 USD per room if we wanted the renovated rooms secondly we ordered food to our room and the lady (LADYA) or something like that she was rude on the phone I felt harassed she told me the menu was very limited and when our food arrived the Asian guy that brought our food almost threw it at me I ordered a set of utensils for two and they only brought one also tried to charge me for not bringing them the first time also missed my steak knife even though I ordered steak and eggs I would strongly suggest to eat outside this type of room service was a first for us. Never going back again. The overall service throughout the casino was terrible. Go to Wynn they are way more professional at that property.
20,Central location - close walking distance to main attractions. Reserved room was not available upon check-in. Housekeeping entered room twice without announcing self. Key cards did not work and digital key does not work in elevator. Fridge won’t open if room reserved with debit card. Bathtub did not drain and had to call for maintenance.
40,Hotel was nice loved the decor the food is good. I didn’t like that fact that in a motel 6 you can get a fridge and microwave and not in this hotel w/out paying $35 more a night and the room seemed out dated room.
40,Great place to stay but the room was a let down. The shower was like a mister. The pool was one of the best in Vegas. The location can’t be beat and the room was clean. If you are in the room in Vegas you are doing it wrong.
30,There was a ton of kids everywhere. The restaurant service was slow and always had a wait. The wifi dropped every couple of mins. A ton of swingers in the pool area. Security was unfriendly and follow you around often.
50,My first time staying here and I would do it again! I can always expect a great stay when staying at an Mgm property. Definitely would recommend to a friend. Staff was nice and rooms were clean. I just hate that buffets are closed all over.
50,Good clean great customer service. Everything about my stay was amazing no complaints. Easy access to everything which was good for me an my family. I would recommend staying here to anyone visiting Vegas.
30,Extended my stay through hotel reservations. Received calls every morning up to that date about why I hadn't vacated. Very uncomfortable. Finally decided to just change hotels and was told I had to vacate within 10 minutes or be charged for another night even though my credit card was already charged for that night. Very disorganized and I was treated like a criminal.    There was hair in the dresser and bathroom drawers. Someone's grocery bags in bottom drawer of dresser.
50,I arrived today morning and was lucky enough to rent a Room at the Mirage and they gave me a reservation For a very accommodating Room in less than a hour of booking online The staff was friendly the rooms were clean and parking Was very convenient
40,"The Mirage has many activities that are kid friendly. Starting with the ""volcano"" in the front of the hotel that gives a great show with beating drums building up to the big explosion to the Secret Garden where exotic cats and playful dolphins live (and you can actually get close up to the dolphins! The fees are reasonable too) there is so much to do and see inside and out of the hotel. It seems to be less smoke filled than the other casinos (wouldn't it be great if they were ALL smoke free?!) We didn't come home smelling like ashtrays which is much appreciated. The condition of our room could have been a little better but no doubt the room has seen many a drunken idiot.... The carpet was dirty I wouldn't allow my child to play on it while we were there - making him sit on the bed the whole time was challenging - he didn't appreciate that at all. It would make more sense (to me) if they simply did away with disgusting carpets and used laminate flooring instead that can be easily cleaned and sanitized. You really can't ask for a better location the hotel is right smack dab in the center of it all. We walked to the ""High Roller"" (enormous ferris wheel) and rode it (fun!) and shopped at the swanky Cesar's Palace mall. Just a few blocks down is the Belagio that has a super cool water show. We didn't spend much money while there because there are so many neat things that are free like the water show and the Mirage's volcano. Unfortunately Vegas is seeing a common problem on the streets with a growing homeless population which made for some dirty areas. We actually saw a rat on the street (and you know that people are walking where that rat has been where homeless individuals have relieved themselves and then walking on hotel room carpets - gross!!!) Despite the bad stuff that is out of the Mirage's control we had a really great time so many positive memories were created at the there! We plan to return someday. I was sad to leave!"
50,If it weren't for COVID-19 and the ensuing measures I'm sure we would have liked the Mirage more. As it was the air was filled with a heavy scent (sanitizer?) that burned our eyes and made us feel sick. Most of the restaurants were closed. There is currently no valet service and masks must be worn at the pool when not actively swimming. Just didn't find it relaxing enough. But on the plus side the staff was great and the hotel was clean.
50,Loved the hotel n room the room i stayed in was huge everybody in the mirage was very very helpful and friendly I would come again and stay at the mirage absolutely loved it here and the pantry restaurant was very good as well
40,Our stay at the Mirage was very good. The location is great and allows for easy access to everything the Las Vegas Strip has to offer. The pool is speculating with its waterfall and several fountains giving a very paradise feel to the Mirage’s pool.
30,Hotel smells tabaco and old odor carpets need to be replaced humidity marks on the walls etc. Check out at app doesn’t work. I tried to warn a manager about one cristal glass on the floors to prevent an accident but didn’t listen to me....
50,The hotel is very clean and hand sanitizers gloves and masks available everywhere. We were given a mask and hand sanitizer in our room upon arrival. The machines are tight so don't expect a big payout. We did go to TI and won there. There is a tram to get to TI if your feet are extra tired from walking the strip.  The strip is about 50/50 for people wearing masks outside but it is mandatory every time you are inside.  I can't say enough how friendly every worker we came in contact with was towards us.  There is a mobile check in/ out so no need to stand in line if you download the MGM app. You can print your own keys or use the digital key on the app.  All and all we had a good time but I don't think I will go back until we no longer have to wear masks everywhere. It is very difficult to wear a mask at the pool in 99 degree weather.
30,"I have stayed at the Mirage many times This review was based on my visit after the COVID reopening. Gaming was much more restrictive than other casinos in the area. Also appeared fewer games were open. The Carnegie Deli is now closed (was one of my favorites). The clientele was significantly different than the past. This may be due to COVID and the significant reduction of room rates. I also do not see the value of ""resort fees"". I will always rate down when these are added. Housekeeping did an outstanding job!"
50,excellent location close to everything to walk and enjoy the environment outside and inside the place. The fashion mall bellagio the high roller venetian etc If you like to play the casino has good slot options but very tight.
50,I had a good stay at the hotel I drink eat sleep an gamble good.. I felt safe my entire there .. I see persons going around cleaning the games off I see persons going around telling people to pull there mask up.. I was a good second experience for me .. looking forward for a next stay there
30,"Had several issues during my last stay here. The staff - especially Jasmine - did a great job in resolving them for me. Unfortunately some of them couldn't be overcome.    Not convinced that they actually did all the things they stated in their in-house video to ensure the cleanliness and safety of their guest rooms and the hotel. There were little things - smudge marks on the iron; heavy ""traffic"" stains on the carpets; etc. - that made me wonder about just how committed they were to meeting their objectives to preventing the spread of COVID19.    Experienced a couple of other operational ""fails"" during our stay - incorrect room charges; retail outlet glitch; locked out of room - hotel's fault; In-room Checkout unavailable. All were pleasantly resolved by their staff but overall not a great guest experience."
30,The short older man that works the counter was so rude!! More worried about cutting into his lunch than providing any hospitality  to out of state visitors in need of a vehicle. Never had such an awful experience.
50,The Mirage was much nicer than it's neighbor Treasure Island. Hotel was clean staff was friendly and informative and the view from our room was nice! I found the lion leopard and tiger enclosures to be a bit too small for animals of those sizes. It was kind of sad honestly. But I'm sure the animals quality of life is much better than if they were to be in the wild....
50,The hotel was extremely clean they followed all safety protocols for corona virus measurements.There are plenty of things to do without even having to leave the hotel restaurants shows and even a convenience store located inside. They have scooters you can rent if your not in the best shape to do a lot of walking which is required in Vegas! I will most definitely be coming back with my kids next time
40,Enjoyed our stay. 10 bucks for a coke was excessive. Bed was broken down and hurt our backs. Wish everything was open and available. Enjoyed our stay other than that. People were friendly and accommodating
50,If you are looking for a stay where you feel like family and total comfort i suggest staying here at The Mirage. stayed here over a weekend during this whole Covid-19 Pandemic and must say that my experience was amazing. the staff ensured that everyone practiced social distancing as well provided safety precautions and equipment.
10,I stayed here for 6 nights and I can’t even fathom listing all the service issues experienced.    The reviews are true and all I’ll add is if you care about anything else other than the hard product (which is average 4 stars) stay away. Service. Cleaning. Attitude. Safety. All 1 star. I spoke with the manager and it’s clear it comes top down. It’s sad to see an establishment that has potential just completely loose touch with its service mindset. The Mirage glory days are clearly in the past. There are a few good employees down the line and hopefully they’ll find their ways into more solid establishments. With so many options in town I recommend staying elsewhere.    (Mlife Platinum. Hyatt Globalist. Bellagio loyalist.)
20,Our room was 80* and we were told they needed to “conserve energy”. We paid extra for a strip view but couldn’t enjoy the view as we kept the curtains closed in an effort to cool the room down. We were offered a new room the night before we were departing however if they didn’t brush off our concern upon arriving to our room on our 1st day maybe we would have had a comfortable restful stay and sleep.
40,Hotel & location was great. Casino was clean with plenty of space to play. Food & evening entertainment was good. Only downfall was that there were too many new slots missed some of the older machines. Also ran out of time and couldn't make it to the pool. A must if staying here.
30,The overall hotel An dining was nice . Trying to get your bags to your room was a bit of a chore . No valet - had to move Your luggage from parking garage to check in. Then across casino to elevators to room.
50,Easy reservations and check in. The room was great. They seem to of gone out of their way for cleansing this. Location is right where you want to be in the sooner the action on the strip. The shops well I spent too much money in the shops.
50,Awesome stay and trip the staff was amazing and very ready to help and was amazing that’s all I know to say when I go back I plan on staying here and enjoying all the benefits the mirage has to offer I loved it
50,I love the location. I was hoping for a better view. Also room service was not open to order food. We had a great time food food and drinks. I will be back again. The Mirage was a beautiful location.
50,We’ve tried almost every major property on the Strip and we keep coming back to the Mirage. Beautiful rooms great staff solid food lovely pool area and we like the animals from the fish at reception to the secret garden in back. Centrally located love the volcano and once shows reopen Shin Lim & Colin Cloud put on a fantastic show.
50,I usually don’t stay here but I came for a wedding and everyone was staying here because “this is their place”. Thanks to Covid the rooms were a good price. I get why people love it here. It was great
50,We were very happy with our visit we will definitely be coming back. Don Presser took great care of us and I just have absolutely no complaints. We ate the Italian Restaurant the Japanese restaurant and twice at The Heritage Steakhouse which is my husband’s favorite. Each of the restaurants provided us with great customer service and delicious food.
10,Room had huge nasty roaches in the bathroom (front desk refused to handle the situationand said they'll only look into it once we check out). Got charged for taking something from the minibar even though I did not take anything (they checked the room and nothing was missing). I would not recommend going here unless you're comfortable with the above mentioned.
30,Had a two day stay at Mirage after 3 nights at the Flamingo. Decided to cut my trip in two nights at each property. Flamingo would have been free without Resort Fee but I wanted to go to the Mirage pool so I bucked up on the Resort Fee plus taxes. Mirage pool is the gem stone of the casino. Check in was great and they gave me a small upgrade as things were VERY slow. Most table games still not open and most bar tops empty with the exception of the Sportsbar. Some casnin's in Vegas were busy others were not. Even for a Monday/Tuesday in September with current medical conditions I could not believe how slow things were. Bed was comfy bathroom was nice. This classic Vegas show girl of a casino to put it bluntly was boring. Vegas still on the rebound. Staff were friendly and cocktail service was better than the Flamingo and Caesars. I would have died of thirst in the pits in Caesars. 45 minutes with nary a server and I asked a slots attendant three times to send on over. They are really cheaping out on staffing the casino floors everywhere. I was over four days with the exception of Cosmo. In closing Mirage doing everything very average but nothing currently standing out. I was a little surprised. When the pool weather ends I think I would be at Cosmo or Venetian or even MGM long before here. This used to be my favourite casino. I hope it gets its mojo back. Final thing. They did have maid service and Flamingo did not. Good on MGM for doing so. I have gone without maid service at Ceasers casinos twice in the last 2.5 months. So that is also a positive
10,Upon check-in I was told my room would be ready in an hour. We ate and stayed close by didn’t go to the pool like we wanted because due to covid it’s 50% occupancy and if you leave you may not get back in and have to be put on a waitlist. Even if it’s only one person in your party that leaves. Few hours later still not ready but they were “cleaning it” so we hung around the casino. Finally few hours more I went to a manager and was told yes room is being clean at that moment (must be a giant room) and would get us in ASAP. After total of 5hrs of waiting heated that we could’ve been at the pool and wasted the day my room was ready but only to see it wasn’t the suite. They said we can move you the next day to one. At the time I checked in I had given a deposit that I was told I could use for charging to the room. The next day we charged some at the pool and finally got into our new room which was dirty. Hair in bathroom and rug not Vacuumed. At dinner in one of the very few places opened at Mirage the waitress was terrible. She clearly forgot to put our app in and blamed the kitchen then tried to over charge me on our drinks.  I woke the next day to see that my bank card had been run again for a large amount and now my spending cash was tied up. I spoke with the “head cashier” manager and he said well it’s based on the fact you charged things to your room and we wanted to make sure there was enough. WTH! I hadn’t even gone over the first deposit and they just decided to run my card without me knowing. I was mad because we had no intentions of charging any more and when I said I guess I’ll have to now charge to the room since you took my spending cash off my debit card he rudely told me my card would be run again if I did! So you tie my funds up even when I hadn’t been over my original deposit then tell me I can’t use that!??? This is very shady and no reversal would get my funds back on my card in time for me to use. (BTW it’s been 4days and the funds still haven’t been released) I now don’t have any of that spending cash for remainder of my trip. Awesome!  I’ve stayed with them in the past years all the time even in the penthouse numerous of times back when guess relations was phenomenal. Spend a little more and stay at Bellagio or Aria. Never coming back here! Besides the over the top pool patrol on mask wearing (in water next to people without mask is ok but laying 6ft apart is not) our last day there we tried to catch the volcano show and nothing happened. I asked a security personnel and was informed the guy called in sick lol seriously!??? You only have one person who runs it?? SMH
50,The trip to Las Vegas was pretty amazing we got engaged at the Sky Walk. So we stayed in a suite at the Mirage the room was amazing. House keeping kept it super clean. The Mirage staff was very accommodating.
30,Our room had some issues. The shower was bad. The toilet was broken. Someone had to come to our room. We weren't there. When we got home my husband's ring was gone. We had two jewelry pouches and one was gone. We also told the maid not to come in but there were towels put in our room anyway. Bed was comfortable.
30,They took our dirty towels but did not leave clean towels to replace them. They did not leave a new liner for the ice bowl. The floor was not clean. The staff at Siegfried and Roys Secret Garden were amazing. The shower sprays so hard you get a good exfoliation.
50,It was so beautiful the view the fire show the waterfalls i absolutely love the mirage i will be back and would absolutely stay at the Mirage everything and the waterfall pool is to die for I cannot wait to go back
20,Just returned from 4 nights at the Mirage. Thursday check-in was great. Room on the 18th floor with a view of the pool and mountains. Room was 1st from the foyer near the elevators. Lots of noise after midnight from people headed to their rooms. Thursday and Sunday nights were less crowded in casino. Pool was great on Friday. Our server at the pool indicated that 900 additional rooms were being filled that evening. The casino got very crowded worse on Saturday the crowd was not socially distant many wore masks below their nose and mouth. Crowd was less civilized than previous stays. My favorite restaurant Stack was closed. Typical sandwiches including fries at the The Still Restaurant were $21 and up Beers were $9. Restaurants required RSVP. Casino capacity was not reduced smoking and drinking was allowed. I did not see many machines being wiped down after use but there were dividers at the table games. Floor was re-configured with less machines and many were turned off. Masks were provided  Wipes were not provided (offered in Detroit). Regarding the room; the bathroom was very small about 9x5 with poor lighting. Room was nice size but very dated and worn out. We declined housekeeping but got towels everyday. Service bar but no fridge or coffee in room. Mirage is center strip with many casinos and restaurants nearby. If you want to go to the pool get in line on the weekends as it fills up by 9:30 AM. Slot and VP machines were very tight with very few winners
50,Our stay at the Mirage was met with polite and accommodating staff. Our room was clean and provided amenities such as a refrigerator/ ice maker for use (not filled with items for sale..a separate refrigerator includes these items). We will return to the Mirage on subsequent trips to Las Vegas for sure.
50,Absolutely no issues very pleasant and relaxing for our staycation. Beautiful room of the Strat and Volcano show at night. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. I have and will continue recommending the Mirage Hotel and Casino to anyone I know and everyone I come in contact with
40,We recently traveled to vegas for a quick getaway and enjoyed our time. Vegas isn't fully open but if you want to just walk the hotels and eat some restaurants then it is a good time to go. Vegas is picking back up we thought there was a good amount of ppl just walking and staying at all the hotels.
40,Hotel grounds are beautiful it has a tropical feel. The pools are nice as well. We stayed in a King room and it was a good size room for 2 no fridge but there is a minibar. Our TV kept going in and out with connection. You have the chance to check in via mobile app and if you have not dowloaded it DO SO NOW! This saves so much time and you can get your digital key on your phone. Just wish there were more food options; we stayed at the MGM a few months ago and they had high end restaurants as well as a food court. Sometimes you just want a quick pizza or hotdog.
50,What a great balance... in a time when people are concerned about safety and cleanliness while simultaneously starving for real away-from-home entertainment Mirage hit both out of the park for us. I felt safe as the Mirage guest density is very comfortable while also still somehow providing the fun level that I have come to know for years.
50,Hotel and location is nice minus the resort fees. I loved the convenience of the restaurants casinos and shopping stores being close by. Since COVID has shut down a lot of things I feel like the resort fees should have been refunded.
10,Most of the restaurants were closed during appropriate hours and using the food and beverage credit was made extremely hard though at the end of the day The Mirage did not apply the credits (which I'm still working on getting resolved). The website does a great job of hiding the significantly reduced hours a d days while making it sound as though they are open.    My biggest complaint comes from the pool. I got a daybed that was to include a safe but the staff couldn't get the safe to easily be opened or closed and I was to be reimbursed for the daybed (which also has not happened).    While on the bed I fell asleep while reading and part of the daybed services was for the umbrellas to be positioned throughout the day to combat the sun...this was never done. As I was on the bed asleep I was roasting for 4+ hours in the sun with my mask on. This resulted in me suffering a Heatstroke that completely ruined the rest of the trip. I was bed ridden for several days and needing to take repeated cold showers.    Finally received the efolio and the room rate was wrong the credits not applied and charged standard pricing for everything.    This was a horrible trip and the only redeeming quality was its location and waived parking due to COVID.
30,This was my first visit to Vegas since the beginning of the pandemic. I was very much looking forward to hanging out in Sin City! The check in process was straightforward and the front desk staff was super friendly. Special mention to Michael for being so professional and resolving my issues there.    The room was very spacious with all amenities necessary for a great stay. Bed was comfortable and so were the pillows. There's a mini fridge in the room but you can't use it to store your stuff or you'll be charged a $50 fee for doing so.    The resort amenities were partially opened with some major restrictions. The pool definitely needed to be cleaned as there were countless of leaves and dirt at the bottom. Other annoying thing is that there are so many security guards patrolling the pool area and constantly reminding people to put their mask on. That really annoyed me as I don't understand why someone should wear a mask outside in 103 degree weather! Unless you're in the pool or actively drinking or eating you must wear it the entire time.    The casino was basically the same way with dozens of security guards constantly reminding you to put your mask on even though we just took a sip of our drink. It was definitely too much. I totally understand the rules but they were enforcing them a little too intensely to our liking. Most restaurants were closed and it didn't feel like it was before covid. Overall The Mirage is a beautiful property and the pool area is beautiful but I'd personally wait till covid is over to visit there again.
10,We went to celebrate our Anniversary. Made a formal complaint to Security about being served a cup of water that smelled like SEX! Found a picture of the waitress who served me in my random pictures. Called and no one followed up with me.
20,Everything was like a transaction there wasn't any talk or concern on how our travel went to arrive at Mirage. Making sure to let us know about everything that done to provide a safe and good experience at the Mirage during the pandemic. I expected something to ease my mind that I did not make a big mistake by coming to Vegas. I needed for the resort to let me know they are there for me to keep me safe to the best of their ability during the pandemic. The worst part is I was given a used room I walked in and noticed the phone off the hook. As I turn I looked over to the bed and pillows were everywhere and you can see the indention were people laid. It felt as if someone was still in the room so I called the front desk immediately and they moved me to another room.
30,We had one night in Las Vegas after a week in the Utah parks. Thought by reading the website that the Cirque du Soleil was actually performing. Bought tickets received tickets then got a room. Later that night they cancelled the tickets and I realized that the show was not being performed and never had thought about being performed. But we thought okay we'll go ahead and stay there. Following our GPS we never found the main entrance but were able to enter through the north entrance. It was a long walk for us through all the gambling to get to an elevator. We are not smart enough to gamble so that was a wasted time for us. Walking down the hallway on the 22nd floor one could hear conversation or tv out of every door along the way. Could hear conversation through the adjoining room so turned the tv on just loud enough to mask that noise. The room itself was great. Plenty of room to consolidate all our belongings into the three bags for the flight out. Left out the next morning  getting to watch unhappy looking smokers playing their games. Oh yea the volcano was fun to watch from our room. Would like to see the Beatles LOVE sometime.
50,The Mirage has stepped up their game with new COVID protocols since they re-opened. Room doors have a nice sanitized sticker to let you know its ready. They included a little bag with the no touch door keys masks and sanitizer. Many of their facilities are open some with modified hours or days. Do not let that sway you!  We enjoyed our stay.
30,Rooms were a little outdated but a plus is the water gets very very hot. Other than that the stay was ok. I didn’t have any issues and nothing was impressive. I felt safe. Masks were required throughout the property.
30,The room and available gaming slots were old and of poor selection. The food at the Heritage Steakhouse was not good and very expensive for the quality and size of the entrees. The property was clean and I did not feel uncomfortable with the CoronaVirus in these unsettled times
30,Got there on a Thursday. There wasn’t a line to check in. Upgraded the room to the tower suite on the highest floor with a complementary view of the volcano show. The room was fair. Had some problems with the toilet but all in all a good stay. Water doesn’t get very hot and kinda annoyed that the makeup mirror did not work.. but no big deal.    No problems getting into the pool. We got there as soon as they opened and stayed for about an hour and it didn’t ever get crowded or reach capacity which was great.    What I did not like was the mask security at the pool. There’s like 40 security officers just walking around making sure your mask is on while just sitting at the pool with a feel is a bit much. We are outside and socially distant. The only people we were coming in contact with were the security guards! Which is very backwards to me. Everyone was socially distant and you couldn’t even take a picture without the security coming up to you about your mask. Most of them were nice but again they walked pass you constantly as if you were a prisoner at the pool.    All and all great hotel. Will stay again after Covid subsides.
30,Substandard room cleanliness That was horrible and disgusting a bottle of personal lubrication was found and that was on the floor near the bed and obviously a gross oversight by the cleaning staff and hospitality in general
40,I was a little worried after reading reviews that the mirage was closed prior to our arrival but it opened the end of August. The casino is very much open. the check in was easy however check out took some time since there were not too many people ( only one) working the front desk. Also it was rather hard finding food to eat in the area at the time. A lot of places are closed but are not reflected on the websites. We tried to go to dinner Sunday night but were surprised with a much smaller menu and smaller space requiring a wait despite a reservation. otherwise we had a great stay. the room was clean and the hotel did a great job with cleaning.
30,Place was under staff and hallways smell rooms were avarege. Pool area was under staff waited over 40 minutes to get service from staff and never got any. Hotel needs a bit of a remodel you can tell is an Old Hotel.
40,I hit a jackpot at The Mirage. Normally always stay at Mirage but they were still closed when I booked our stay. We actually stayed at MGM but spent two full nights hanging out at Mirage casino. Wish we would have moved to the Mirage after the first night. Needless to say I will not stray from Mirage in the future.
50,Great casino lots of activities wonderful stay. Would recomend Mirage to anyone and plan to come back soon. Also great location on the strip. Was able to park ans walk around to everything that was close
50,We enjoyed our stay at the Mirage. I booked it based on recent reviews and recommendations from friends. We have no regrets. The hotel was very clean and easy to navigate. The parking garage was well lit and good signage directing guests. The Pantry restaurant was very good for breakfast. The room was very nice. The room fridge is stocked so we did not have room to keep things cold but I believe you can request an additional fridge. I liked the security at the hotel and the security cards needed to get to your floor and room. The only issue and minor at that was we extended our stay by one day and the front desk person seemed to have trouble with that it seemed to take a long time for whatever reason. I even reserved the room the day before. The pool area was very nice as well.
40,The price for the location is great. The staff was friendly. Casino had plenty of gaming options. They have a good mix of restaurants. The food prices seemed high except for Otoro sushi. Has both family and adult only pool. Rooms just need to be updated.
50,Clean hotel Front Desk very professional and attentive to your needs. Mirage Security enforce the wearing of Mask. A Hand Washing Station provided with mask and gloves for guest. One of the best hotels in Vegas.
50,I am very pleased to have choose to stay at The Mirage and Casino everyone was friendly profession and lively the Hotel was very clean very organized and changed my perspective on the experience and i feel like i am definitely going to be coming out to this hotel again soon excellent Hotel!
50,It was excellent I loved staying are The Mirage and would love to stay here again. The staff here is very nice and friendly the place is very well organized. Love the tropical theme and overall the hotel.
40,Mirage hotel is very centred on the strip great location. Stayed at the Mirage a few times but this time was a little disappointed. There was no Room number at my door so was not sure if I was at the right Room. the Room needed to be vacuumed and the bathroom water was very hot almost unbearable had to stand at the back of the tub to shower. The TV kept going in-and-out the signal was not good.
50,Fantastic service ambiance tunes scents and gambling. I’ll definitely return for another stay when I can find time off from my own service industry job. If I could visit more often I definitely would thank you for making my trip amazing!
50,The Mirage did an excellent of job of cleaning and maintaining the appropriate social distancing for their staff and guests. The size of the resort is perfect. Everything is close and handy. All of the restaurants were open and spaced out for social distancing. Rooms are large and the bed was super comfortable.
20,Housekeeping walked in my room more then once yes there was a sign to put on the door but why should I have to remember that when I just paid moneys to stay there. I’m not a complainer I just wont stay there again
10,They should have kept the Mirage closed. This property and the employees are old unengaged and unwelcoming. There are better ways to lose your money. They had limited eating options. The food at the new Snack the Old Pantry and the steak house was expensive but terrible. Maybe the new owners of Caesers will provide value because MGM just does not care.
50,it was a great trip the staff was really nice and kind. the hotel was clean and very well taken care of. the pool was a great time. kim at the front desk found out out why we were out there and gave us a free upgrade. it made us feel very special. patrica inside essentials and the patrica that is a server also made our experiance at your hotel incredible. thank you and cant wait to come back
50,Service was great room was super clean and the restaurants were excellent ! The rooms were beautiful and we truly enjoyed our stay. The casino floor was great fun with never ending free drinks to keep us happy! Overall Excellent Stay!!
10,I’ve stayed here several years ago and wanted to see if their was any improvements and now I see why I stayed away for so long! It was a wasted comp night that I’m trying to get my money back from! Notice I said COMP night yet my was card on file was charged 3 different times for different amounts! Now I’m getting the run around on getting this resolved and my money returned to my account! Next time I’ll continue my stay at the Venetian across the street or go back to Bellagio for my comp nights I never had a problem of this magnitude! I didn’t want to end my birthday trip and vacation stressed! Using self parking bring good walking shoes.
10,Don't waste your money going to the Mirage ! the most unfriendly staff in all areas of operation I will never go there again and i will make it my job to tell everyone how awful that retched place really is.
40,Normally a great property to stay and play. Understandable that there are limited restaurants and shops open but no bar service? If ordering drinks one must wait for a server which are few and far in-between. ...and remember to cover your mouth after each and every sip of your drink or you'll be scolded by the 'face mask police'.
40,We wanted to try a different casino this trip. We chose The Mirage. Our room was clean comfortable. It was easy to navigate around the casino floor. We didn’t have maid service due to Covid but maid service was an option.  We had no problem getting towels. The hotel was quite crowded over the weekend. There were mask stations at the entrances and hand washing areas as well as hand sanitizer areas. Guests were reminded to cover their faces if they were lax. There was a lot of drinking and smoking going on and at times no social distancing. In all fairness in a crowed space it would be difficult.
50,They are Covid ready... I saw constant cleaning and the staff was on top of guest removing their mask. The hand washing stations with spare mask were plenty...everywhere was friendly and helpful staff.
30,Not at all the same experience...but what is these days? It is annoying to see the internal bars closed but the restaurants are open. I can sit down over here with a group of people not wearing a mask but I can't do the same 20 feet away. Does not make sense to me. Also did not feel as safe walking on the strip even during the day. Too many aggressive people.
20,This by far was one of the worst hotel experiences we have had in Vegas. My newly wedded wife and I visit Vegas quite often and The Mirage was definitely not up to par with the other hotels we have stayed in before in Vegas. It’s not worth it and there are way better options that you can choose from for the money and you will have a way better experience.
50,The hotel was beautiful and the staff was great. No complaints except for issues in my room. I’m ready to go back and I just left. I would stay there again in a heartbeat. It’s close to everything we wanted to see and do.
50,Rooms were great + it’s in a great location on the strip for easy access to cruz to other casinos. Super clean and the staff were awesome!!! I recommend the Mirage hotel to anyone trying to get away and relax in a nice plush hotel & casino!!
30,Two rooms before getting a nice cool comfortable room. Inconvenient to be relocating in between plans made for the day. No resort fee credit give. Not a happy person. Hotel should have made it right. I will consider a different hotel next year
40,Was there for the grand reopening and I was happily impressed. Totally spotless and the service by all the workers was absolutely incredible. Loved that the Volcano show came back! Can’t wait to visit again.
40,First time staying here and the experience was very good. A classic Vegas property that has been well maintained. The room is a bit dated but comfortable. The pool is nice - water super cold though. Service very efficient and safety is a priority. Would stay again.
30,This is our first time in this hotel. It was a very busy time lots of people in the checked in counter but the front desk Filipino guys who assisted us is very nice and knowledgeable. The location is just perfect & the hotel room clean thou the design seems outdated . Our only complaint perhaps is that we have to pay extra for parking and pay for the resort fees thou we explicitly told them that we will not use any of the hotel pools and other facilities.
30,Whilst I don't necessarily love the inside of the Mirage or even gambling there it is an iconic building that I do enjoy visiting when in Vegas. I love the volcano the look of the building from the outside and the general outdoor gardens and environment. Sure it's become a bit dated but I also love the fact that it's there. i.e. that it hasn't been knocked down and replaced with some bland monstrosity. Whilst I generally prefer the themed resorts the Mirage still hits some spots for me because of the above.
50,Stayed for 4 nights fantastic suite. Great pool and restaurants on property are really good. Great location to because you are by shopping and good entertainment. Would definitely stay again easy to get in/out and free parking.
50,We actually had our wedding reception in on of the 3 bedrooms villas (June 2019 - but I forgot to write a review). Honestly exceeded expectations. The room was gorgeous and the service was another level. I booked a 2 bedroom penthouse for my bridesmaids and a 2 bedroom hospitality suite for my mother. The guy at the front desk (Marty) was amazing. My mum's suite wasn't available and he compensated us with something (cannot remember for the life of me what it was... Possibly food or spa related). His service was 11/10.  Couldn't have asked for a better experience. Thank you so much.
40,Gambling food shows and animals make the Mirage a fun attraction. The casino is large and comfortable. The food options are very appealing. Terry Fator is a great entertainer. The animals (fish tank dolphins and tigers) are great for those with an interest in wildlife.
50,We stayed here the first week of March just before the lock down. Had a fantastic time. The hotel was clean  the room we had ( deluxe twin ) was spacious and had everything you need apart from a kettle and tea / coffee things. The front of desk staff were very helpful. We ate here twice once for dinner and once for breakfast in the self service restaurant. This was a bit expensive about $21 a head if i remember. If you want to eat in this restaurant in the evening it is $37.00 a head. A tip leave the hotel go over the road and there is a kiosk selling cut price show tickets you can also buy vouchers there for the restaurant and save 25%. We had a great time and when we come back we will defiantly stay here again.
40,Not easy to review under these circumstances. Visited in March arrived the day before Corona shut the city down. We were given no prior warning from MGM management that this was a possibility prior to our arrival. By morning the casino was shut down that afternoon the restaurants were closed. All shows were cancelled. And we then we learned the hotel is shutting down after seeing a sign on the front doors. I know this was all done as a necessity but in the end we spent a lot of money to look at an empty casino offering no food no entertainment and no refunds prior to arrival. They even shut off the volcano show and front lights on us. Would hope that they would encourage us to return in the future with free or discounted rates so we can have an opportunity to experience the real Las Vegas we paid for.
50,The hotel was amazing. So big and full of life. We had a great room with an okay view (see picture attached) the pool was big and clean. Overall the hotel is central to the strip and has everything either inside or within walking distance that you would need. Only downside was the fridge is weighted so you can’t keep your own water or anything inside it. Staff were very friendly and helpful restaurants were clean and food was great. Would visit again.
40,My partner and I visited the Mirage to see the Beatles Love Cirque du Soleil show in February. We walked around the casino first and ate at their restaurant Stack. It was a really nice dining experience. Love was an amazing show. Afterwards we played blackjack for an hour and broke even so that was lucky! We saw the volcano explosion outside when we were leaving which was fun. Overall this hotel/casino had a nice vibe I would return for sure.
50,We were treated very kindly by check in staff and even got an upgrade for a lesser price than normal. We wee given a room on the top floor looking down on the volcano. The room was a little small but cozy with a nice big easy chair. The bathroom was very nice with a glass enclosed shower which could fit both of us. We had a very nice relaxing time there and hope to go back and stay and see the Beatles LUV show.
30,Stayed on the Strip at this venerable establishment. Friendly staff spacious rooms tiny bathroom but easy to access and enjoyable. Main lobby not too trendy but functional. Overall good value and good.
10,We stayed here on the last night before the hotel closure due to COVID.  First issue: nobody sent us any email prior to arrival to let us know that the casino was closed the spa was closed the fitness center was closed the valet was not available late check out was not available and half the restaurants in the resort were closed.  Still they made us pay the entire resort fee basically we had to pay ~40$ to use the WiFi...    While I understand the emergency it doesn’t cost anything to warn your customers ahead so they can make an informed decision or discount the resort fee. If you can’t do either you could at least give a free room upgrade as the hotel is basically empty.    COVID aside several other things that in my opinion are not in line with the start or reputation of this hotel:  - you have to walk for ages btw parking and rooms passing through the entire casino and dragging luggage on the moquette  - there is no plugs next to the bed in the room  - any extra in the room has crazy costs (e.g a small bottle of water for 12$)  - you can’t even use the in room fridge for your stuff as it’s full of stuff for sale and a note says if you move anything they will charge you 50$  - there is zero insonorization btw the rooms during the night a crazy couple in the room in front of ours was fighting and banging on doors... it sounded like they were in our room...    All in all it surely is an impressive building but honestly I have been cared for way more in cheaper hotels motels and Inns... would definetely not recommend
50,The Mirage Hotel and Casino has always delivered the great level of hospitality that I expect from them. I would like to thank all of their employees for making my stays memorable when I visit.  The check-in staff has always been friendly. Even when lines are long they make me feel like an individual. I have always been greeted with a smile and have never felt like I am just another visitor that they have to deal with.  Rooms are always clean and cleaning staff has always fulfilled special requests such as please leave extra towels or I'm sure their favorite thing to hear... no service needed today :)  I am torn between my favorite places to eat. A special nod to Heritage Steak because not only is the food good but I love getting a table where I can view the casino floor while I eat. It's a total Vegas immersion! I also love having breakfast at the Pantry. Soooo yummy!  My favorite show is Love! I have seen it 3 or 4 times now and I can't wait to see it again. The show is well thought out and they add changes/modifications as they see fit. It's fun to notice those unexpected things.  The location is perfect for me as I wouldn't want to be anywhere else on the strip. To me it feels like I have easy access to everything I want while I'm in Vegas.  A big thank you to Mirage for being everything I expect and more when I visit. Your associates are awesome! All my best to them during this trying time!
50,Unfortunately we have not traveled to this resort YET since we had to cancel travel due to COV19. We were going to meet up with 5 other couples from 3/23 - 3/26. We had tickets also to the Beatles show. All charges were refunded graciously without any issues. We will most definitely rebook once this pandemic is controlled. Thank you Mirage!
50,We had to cancel prepaid hotel and shows at The Mirage. They were friendly and warm human beings who spoke to us as people they knew and fully reimbursed us. Not the robots at some other business’s like Airbnb Sixt and Delta who want to penalize us and make us grovel. Thank you to The Mirage staff. We hope to visit when this nightmare is over. Be well!
50,We had plans to stay at the Mirage and had Show tix. Due to Coronavirus we had to cancel we live in a containment area in NY. I want to say thank you to the people we spoke to at the Mirage who could not have been nicer! They really embody the meaning of the word hospitality. Beyond that they were just civilized so refreshing in todays world. Thank you Mirage hopefully this virus will be ended soon. We look forward to returning. Thank you
40,This was my 8th time in Vegas and I've stayed at many different hotels. I found the Mirage a great hotel to stay at. The location is great in the middle of the strip next to Caesar's across from Harrah's and the Venetian. The hotel itself is nice but can use some updating as some of the areas look alittle tired. We visited in late November so finding the pool closed for renovation was ok as the weather was cool.    We booked a king strip view room. The view was ok not a huge strip view but nice enough. Most of the room was fairly updated all but the carpet. No in room coffee which was too bad as the coffee places tend to be pricey & it would be nice to have the option of having a brew on the room.    The Cravings buffet was very good. Lots of great choices and good value. We also ate a light dinner at the Carnegie Deli which was good. We found the Pantry a good choice for breakfast & a late night snack. This hotel has alot of good restaurant options.    When we booked or room the Mlife Hotels had a $50 food & beverage offer so we were able to use the credit at the Mirage & other resorts. We had lunch at House of Blues at Mandalay Bay. Great food & reasonable prices. We had drinks and appetizers at the Alibi lounge at the Aria. Nice atmosphere but pricey and the food was just ok.    The concierge booked us tickets to see The Beatles Love Cirque du Soleil show & it was excellent. This hotel as has the Terry Fator show which I saw previously & it is a great show for all ages.    The Mirage is a great hotel with a great center strip location. It is a suitable hotel for couples families & single people. Overall we had a great stay and a great time. I highly recommend staying at the Mirage.
30,We stayed at The Mirage for three nights and have no major complaints about the room itself. For some strange reason housekeeping skipped a day of cleaning our room which wasn't that big a deal except that we ran out of clean towels so we had to call the front desk for more. Also the water/snack tray situated above the mini-bar made me a bit nervous. If you pick up any item to maybe look at it even if you have no intent to consume it or even nudge anything on the tray it will trigger an automatic charge to your room bill. Maybe I'm naive but I've never seen anything like this before and it seems outrageous to me to have that kind of eager-to-charge-the-customer-for-anything-and-everything mentality is pretty greedy.    This is possibly not The Mirage's fault but I purchased a air fare/hotel package from Expedia and Expedia's fine print was a bit ambiguous as to whether resort fees was included in the price. Lo and behold at checkout there was additional $140+ resort fees added to my bill so the seemingly good deal I thought I initially had turned out to be bogus.
50,Had a great 5 day stay here no complaints loved every minute and best beds I’ve ever slept in. Stayed in a queens double strip view. Didn’t like the tigers they were pacing and very sad to see this would be my only criticism
50,This was my first time in Las Vegas! First time playing slots! AND first time playing Roulette!!! Yolly was our dealer and she was so much fun! If you want a good time gambling find her at The Mirage! She made our trip memorable!
50,Las Vegas is literally my favorite city on earth. I love every time I go there and I’m already yearning to go back. The check in was very quick! I was excited to let them know that it was my fiancé and I first time in Las Vegas together. We also had a large group. They did a good job of putting our room close and gave us an amazing strip view! The room was clean and modern. The bathroom was huge! Love that the pool is open year round. They have a nice little poker room where you can have some fun socialize and hopefully win some money! Top notch experience and they recycle! Only complaint is the mini bar and resort fees. Mini bars are a total waste.
50,I have been to Las Vegas three times and this was by far my favourite hotel that we’ve stayed at. The pool atmosphere is so much fun it’s huge with lots of room to swim around privately. Good music relaxing and beautiful scenery. We had a penthouse and it was stunning! So much room to relax and enjoy out stay. We will definitely be staying here again when we return on our very vacation !!
40,We stayed middle of the week 2 comp nights paid for 3rd .Checked in around 8pm Upgrated to a suite for the 30 $ extra a night. Gave us suite with private Elevator 0n 26th floor over looking the Volcano  got into rooms window was open floor was wet  So we were not to worried about it was in rush to meet up with an old friend.  Partied all night got back to the hotel 4am Gambled lost 400$ on Blake Sheldon machine ... Dumb .. anyways back to the room and smelt like wet socks  we were not unpacked yet so went downstairs and complained gave us a another room and waived resort fees for that night  the next day went to pool and was impressed with it even though main pool was not open  service was great @ pool 26 $ for big Daqs but plenty of room  chairs were abundant and sat right up at the pool  did that for three days  they have a really good buffet and was pleased with that  we paid 50$ for late check-out so we could sit at the pool and hang out before evening flight  I was not pleased with hidden fees   I tipped over some pistachios in the room leaving money for the maid and they charged me 36$ assuming that was it.wtf so I hope she ate them but doubtful  would not refund when called them and would not tell me what it was for   Location is great !! Hotel loved the pool But rooms I'm eh about  price reasonable except for hidden fees  I would stay there again just for the pool!!
20,When I arrived the floor of my hotel room was dirty. The bathroom had hair all over the tile and the carpet was littered with micro trash. I had a quick turn around to go meet my party at dinner so I called the front desk to see if they could resolve this. When I got back from dinner the bathroom floor was cleaned but the carpet seemed dirtier. For example there was a small pile of nerds candy in the corner of my room. I did not have any candy with me...    I received a massage manicure and pedicure at the mirage spa. The massage was nice but the nail technician really hurt my left big toe. I had to soak my foot for two consecutive nights because of my nailbed was throbbing and appeared to be infected.    When my cell phone charger died I called the front desk to inquire about the cost of the in-room cell phone charging kits. For whatever reason the room did not have an alarm clock so I had no choice but to purchase the $40 phone charging kit-- despite all the issues I had had with the room and services this charge was not offered to be comped.    This was my first trip to Las Vegas. I was so excited to see my childhood friends and explore the city but sadly my stay the Mirage took away from the trip. I was very dissatisfied with my stay.
50,We were offered a bargain rate and since we have stayed several times over the past few years we returned for 7 nights. Check-in was quick and easy. Due to an early flight we arrived before noon and they had a room ready for us. Immaculate! The room was kept very clean and everyone was courteous friendly and helpful. Slots were a bit tight but on the Strip that seems to be the norm. Location is great. Venetian and Harrahs are directly across the street and Treasure Island a 2 minute tram ride away. Great variety of entertainment. Lady at the Concierge was very helpful in assisting me check my bags on the plane and get our boarding passes. The main drawback is the high table minimum bets so I played craps across the street. This is a great place to stay and we will return.
40,This is one of the nicer hotels and casinos in Vegas i think. My room was very nice with a great view of the city and the mountains. The only problem is that all the food and drinks there are very expensive.
40,This was our first time at the Mirage. The rooms were great the atmosphere is awesome the restaurants and shops are great and the casino is a blast; a lot of variety. We didn’t have any complaints. The hotel was up to date and our room was cleaned daily with no issues.
40,Loved the Mirage hotel. Really enjoyed it. Our room was on the 22nd floor view of the volcanos. Amazing views. Food places really nice to eat at and buffet breakfast good value. Only downside was a smokey casino but the same in them all. Would Definately go back
50,I was a bit apprehensive after reading reviews which were somewhat mixed. However when we arrived at 10:30am (well before check-in time) we were very well taken care of. I mentioned that it was our 40th wedding anniversary trip and was told they have a room ready in the class we reserved (Resort King) but that if we'd like to wait a bit we could have a Tower King for no additional cost. Turned our luggage over to the Bell desk and went off to explore a bit. A half hour later I get a text telling me our room is ready!  Our strip view from the 24th floor was really nice and we could watch the volcano show from our room. Everyone... and I mean every single person on staff whether front desk the staff at the buffet restaurants security people and housekeeping... everyone... had a smile and a pleasant greeting and any questions were answered easily.  The express elevators to the 24th and 25th floors were a great convenience. Yes this is not one of the newest properties on the strip but it was a great experience in a very clean hotel with wonderful staff. Someone mentioned there was no outlet near the bed for their CPAP machine. There was a power strip under the bedside table that worked perfectly for mine (so packing the 10ft extension cord proved unnecessary).  I would have absolutely no qualms at all about returning to the Mirage.
20,Stayed from the 1st-3rd I had 1 night and my best friend has the 2nd night so we combined reservations after the lady talking to a supervisor they said they could do it. I asked if they had any complimentary upgrades and she said she would set us up with a strip view I about died when we got in the room to see that you could barely see some of the strip if you look all the way out the left hand side of the window we pretty much had a view of a pool and the back on caesars palace but oh well. The decorative pillows in the room were dirty and had some food or something crusted on them immediately chucked them to the floor toilet would not work unless you flushed 3 to 4 times to get it to go down...informed them upon check out to look into that and last the box of tissues was sitting empty not a huge deal but still something that was overlooked. Slot machines were very tight and you could not get someone to bring you a drink to save your life we found one lady who said she would be back when she dropped the other off and never returned then my friend actually placed an order and the lady never returned. Ate at the Pantry which was good they have great food! California Kitchen was just ok in my opinon probably would not do it again. On the second day when the reservation switched to my friend the front desk suggested coming and getting new keys so we dont have any issues we did and then upon return in the wee hours of the morning we get all the way up to our room and what do you know they dont work so we had to hike back to the front desk to get new keys. Did ask about late check out at that time and they said 1pm was $30 and 3pm was $50 I said lets do the 3. At check out I asked if we could get the fee waived for the inconvienence of the key not working and after some hesitation the lady said sure. The one thing this place has going for them is its a great location
50,We booked the Mirage for 6 nights for our girls getaway. We had read a few bad reviews about the hotel being dated before we left and didn’t really know what to expect. The reviews couldn’t have been further from the truth especially in our experience. We had a fabulous very clean and updated room on floor 22 with fantastic views over the volcano and over the Strip. The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful. We enjoyed eating in the Stall restaurant in the hotel on many nights. My only disappointment was that there wasn’t any tea/coffee making facilities in the room. I need tea! The hotel had a Starbucks but we preferred walking across the road for tea and an egg McMuffin and bringing back to the hotel every morning. Would highly recommend this hotel for a great break in Vegas.
10,I have been making yearly vacation trips to Las Vegas every year for the last 20 years. This was the First time staying at the mirage and the last. Shower drain was broken allowing the tub to fill up. Call for someone to look at it no one came to fix it. Had to stick a quarter in the drain cap just to let the water out. Got hit with some resort fee at $40 a day without being told. When I asked the front desk about it I was told it was for WiFi and that every hotel had to charge for it.
20,We checked in late 11pm after checking in earlier on - line and informing them of our later arrival.  At 11pm NO KING BEDROOM WAS READY! We couldn't believe it. We were offered a queen bedroom (with a $50 F&B credit).  I also noted at the on line that it was a birthday treat they totally ignored that.  Whats the point of checking in on line!    The snack bar in the room wasn't completely stocked. Didn't matter to me because I never touch the drinks or snacks. Except in this case they refilled it the next day and CHARGED ME for consuming what they had missed to put out! (they credited me after I noticed it on my bill).    The noise.... as if there was no door on our room!    The dealer at roulette swiped away my winning chip as if it had lost. THREE of them there watching and all claimed I was wrong! I insisted that they look at security footage I was right! No apology made me feel like a criminal!    Will never set foot inside that hotel again so many options on the Strip!
40,"Had to visit LV on short notice for a family funeral. Was going to stay near family off Strip but noticed had a 2 free night offer with MLife and $50 resort credit for the basic room. Was traveling with my mom and she had not been to LV in over 20 years.  A day before arrival was able to get upgraded to a Strip view and lower rate! Excellent.  Stayed at the Mirage 2 years ago with my wife in the 1 bedroom penthouse suite so this time it was a different room experience but still just fine. I knew going in what to expect based on reviews. I guess most going to Vegas expect a spa like bathroom for the lower tier rooms and I guess that's what you receive at other casinos/resorts.  Like last time enjoyed the great location and the overall feel and vibe of the Mirage. For a ""nothing special"" stay the lower tier room was fine for our needs and I felt like a great value with the comp.  Was a little bummed to see the burger restaurant changed to Diablo's (Mexican) but spoke to staff and they said they change the food options up from time to time.    Only minor gripe is the shower didn't drain all that fast. Not the first time this has happened at a hotel. We got fresh towels from staff 2 days but didn't ask them to come in and make up the beds.  Used mobile check in and out and it was smooth. Received an email prior to arrival our room was ready.  We for sure stay here again."
30,"The Mirage is still a great place to stay especially with the volcano show in the evening in front of the hotel. The hotel offers a hughe casino and several restaurants and meeting rooms. T I think its just sad that the hotel is using environmentally friendly only as a marketing ""gag"". Even with even if there was a card with a reference to the environment the towels were changed every day.  Give the customer the choise to help the environment!!!"
40,Met a classmate and his wife who I haven't seen since graduation and that was 50+ years ago. I thought the Mirage was a central location and easy to get to since I was driving from N Las Vegas. I used to work in this casino and even though it has changed hands still a nice place. The buffet was great and so very many choices from breakfast to carving station Mexican Chinese seafood great desserts and plenty of time that we were not rushed. I have never been disappointed with this buffet and yes I would go back again.
50,booked early online and got a very good price for room with view of the Strip. comfortable room bed. for the most part quiet ( a few late nite hall conversations could be heard but didn't last). very good location for our needs (walking distance to our venues for shows). good restaurants on site. staff was approachable friendly and answered out questions when we needed guidance. a return trip is likely.
10,I had a business trip into the Mirage. I was trying to check in and lost my I’d on the way into the hotel. The front desk rep was more than willing to help me until she approached the manager just to get final approval. He came to me and said he could do nothing for me. Had to sympathy for my predicament and told me maybe I can go sleep at a bus stop. How rude. I was able to go and get my passport in my work vehicle miles away after my phone died and had to walk back and forth because I couldn’t get a Uber or lyft. When I returned back to check in he cancelled my reservation and noted he did so because of my behavior. I had done nothing wrong. These guy made get these jobs with out any customer service skills. We are the ones that help get them paid. I will never stay here again!!
30,The location was perfect for us . We up graded to a strip view and we upgraded to a strip view with overlooking the volcano. We did receive our upgrades for a steep price of course and what we got was a over priced room with a damaged torn and stained lamp shade . seriously? If you can charge such rates for rooms you can damn well buy a new lamp shade. Also if you want the room with view of volcano keep in mind that sucker is loud when it rumbles and roars during the evening .
50,We stayed at the Mirage because the very funny comedian Iliza Shlesinger was performing there.    Our stay was excellent. The hotel staff was professional and helpful. The accommodations were quite nice. The view out the window was beautiful at night. The entire property was well cared for and pretty.    The Iliza show was a full house and was fantastic!    I highly recommend the Mirage.
40,The bed was very comfortable. The check in check out process was easy and fast. The staff was very nice. The only complaint I have is the small size of the bathroom. The sleeping part was immense and some of that space could have been used for the bathroom.
40,The hotel was very nice. The room size was great and the location excellent. A little smokier smelling than the Cosmo hotel we also stayed in. (in the casino)  The room faced north and I did find the highway noise a little loud earlier in the evening. Could have been a defective seal on the window.
40,So out of all the casino this isn't bad. The volcano is why you come or for a show. The casino is ok the bars are good. The volcano it front is awesome but in my opinion there are better places. They are on the far end of the strip which is close walking to better places.
50,I can’t say enough good things about the Mirage. I’ve stayed here twice before with friends and will be back in April with my husband. The pool area is amazing...absolutely love the poolside restaurant. It’s right in the heart of the strip so it’s so easy to walk everywhere. For the price/value it does not get much better than this in Vegas! Can’t wait to be back! :)
40,We come to Vegas every year but we haven’t frequented the Mirage much before. We loved it!! Beautiful. The Otoro Sushi was excellent (get the Gyoza and Tiger roll) very expensive sushi just ask how many rolls per item so you don’t end up with one or two rolls on a plate costing $18! Ouch. The Shim Lin show was Great! Our tip free self parking at Treasure island and take the free tram to the mirage.
30,My husband retired from the Military after 22 years of service and I wanted to give him a nice getaway. We checked in less than 1 hour ago and I have to say that this is one of the most disgusting bathroom( shower) we’ve had. The nasty ceiling steam water dripped on me while in the shower a over $800 for 4 nights is terrible and sadly we have no choice looks like dry toothpaste on a towel. I’m glad I didn’t plan on taking a bath because that wouldn’t have happened. We’re here for 4 days all it takes is a little more cleaning to the rooms. We are on the 15th floor I had higher expectations of their rooms and we have stayed at many other hotels on the strip. The check in was good but beware if you’re offered a food/ beverage credit you have to pay a incidental fee of 100.00 per night. The bellmen are very prompt and professional. The location is great as well as the amenities inside but the quality of the room is disappointing I expected much more.
50,Love the property but very concerned with data breach. I have been staying at MGM properties for over 20 years and have not heard from MGM Tried messages but no responses. There are lots of option in Las Vegas and I would think that there would be better communication to valued customers?
20,Heavy background odor of cigarette smoke throughout the main floor. Uninspired dining at exorbitant pricing. A pint of ice cream $12.00 and $6.95 at Walgreens across the boulevard. We're becoming 'over Las Vegas'd but its back to the Bellagio next time if ever.
50,I had booked this hotel through a travel agent who recommended it. I read reviews and was worried after reading the negative ones as we are particular travelers who like luxury. We were NOT disappointed in any way from the beginning to the end of our stay. We checked in around 11:30 p.m. and there was no wait which was fabulous. The staff were lovely. We had a room on the 20th floor facing Trump tower and our friends were on a lower level which was not really a big deal to us. Our room was beautiful clean and spacious. We had a partial view of the mountains which made me happy. Mind you we spent less than 6 hours a day in the room to sleep but the beds were very very comfortable and I did not find there was excessive noise. I asked housekeeping for 2 extra pillows and I got 3 just in case they said!  I had read the walk through the casino was too long and smoky. It  was not a problem to us and I did not find it a long walk. Everywhere was smoky in casinos but I never found the Mirage casino more or less smoky than others. The casino staff were friendly and some of the best on the strip. They helped us learn the ropes of 21 and Roulette and was where we enjoyed ending out night and starting our morning! Loved the volcano show the plants the restaurants and the amenities. I was sad as the pool was closed but it was too cold to use anyway in the off season. I would stay here again in a heartbeat as what we got for what we paid exceeded my expectations and I would recommend the Mirage strongly. The location was central and made it easy for us to go around the strip. Checkout went very smoothly and again there was no wait but it was 5 in the morning. Hope to go back soon!
20,Booked a 1 bedroom penthouse suite as I usually do at the Mirage. Arrived at the hotel around 2pm knowing I was early told them I had a dinner at 630pm at The Heritage in the hotel and would appreciate anything they could do to get me into my room early. Waited and waited and waited. Till finally after 6 they got me into my room. Upsetting for what I paid...
50,LOVED THIS PLACE! It is so convenient to stay here and walk every where! ALL employees from the front desk concierge the housekeeper were so kind and helpful. Our room was wonderful and clean. It overlooked the volcano so we watched show at night. It was super quiet too. Will definitely stay there again. All the restaurants were great too
30,My spouse and I have stayed at this hotel many times over the many years. It was a nice place. This past weekend we decided to give the casino another visit...we’re now locals. This is what we found: The waterfalls outside have been taken out and the areas have been replaced with shrubbery. The dolphin statues have been painted an unappealing green...they look so tacky. The casino is rather dark and Many of the slot machines were not working. I had to call service 2x. We couldn’t find many machines with games we enjoy. Drink service was painfully slow though friendly. During the afternoon not many choices for dining. Not much in the way of shops either. The Center Bar is open...not impressed. Lousy service and overpriced drinks. Rumbar was open outside but none of the heaters were on so too chilly for enjoyment. In my opinion the place has gone downhill. Too many nicer places to take our business no need to accept average in Las Vegas.
20,I've been to Vegas before and have been in the Mirage before this trip to see shows or to see the Dolphin sanctuary and the dolphins are truly amazing. I was treated well on those visits so I was shocked at the rude customer service and just general disrespect when we stayed at the Mirage this past weekend.    We made a reservation through cancelon and I guess it reserved two rooms. I didn't know this until we got to the hotel as I received only one confirmation but I found out I had been charged for 2 rooms instead of one. Despite reserving a King room months ago we were given the crappiest handicap room with two small beds instead of one King bed. This was Valentine's Day weekend so it sucked that the beds were so small I couldn't even sleep in the same bed as my boyfriend. The shower floor was so hard it actually cut my feet. I was told that since I didn't book directly through the hotel I was SOL. Apparently if you don't book with the Mirage directly you are the scum of the Earth and they won't try to help you. If there was a problem with the room we reserved months in advance we should have been contacted then and not treated like trash upon arrival.    We had problems with other staff throughout the weekend. My boyfriend and I both look young despite being in our mid 20s and I think people discount us because of our age. The bellhop spit at us on one occasion when we asked to store our bags. We were waiting to confirm he had everything he needed from us to store our luggage and he rudely asked us why were still standing there. On another occasion we were asking the cashier if there was a machine to convert our coins to dollars to use on the slots and the woman scoffed and told us it's been out of order forever. We were overall treated with disrespect. We ended up spending most of the weekend hanging out at the Paris Hotel where the staff treated us with kindness and there was a unique ambiance. We had dinner at the California Pizza Kitchen at the bar and the bar tender was rude to us and glared at us for most of the meal and seemed mad we didn't order more food than our 2 entrees.    Long story short I would only visit the Mirage for the show (Beatles Love is great) or to see the dolphins in the secret garden. We did the trainer for a day and the paint with dolphins and the staff and experience over there was great. However I would never ever stay here again as a hotel guest again. Attitude adjustment needed for staff.
40,Once upon a time the Mirage was the most resplendent hotel in all of Las Vegas. Times have changed but the resort still provides a solid stay.    Pros  1. The hotel is in an excellent location. Most major strip hotels are within walking distance and most major on and off-strip attractions are a sub-$10 Uber or Lyft ride away.  2. The bedding is excellent and makes for an easy sleep.  3. Customer service from the staff was excellent. As other reviews from around this time indicate the Mirage was struggling with capacity issues over the course of the long weekend and we we needed to move rooms one morning. However the check-in agent was friendly and upgraded us to a nice strip view room on a high floor for our trouble.  4. The hotel is easy to navigate relative to other strip casinos.  5. Pricing is excellent relative to other strip casinos of similar quality.    Cons  1. It appears that some of the rooms are not particularly well-maintained. We were forced to stay in a handicap-accessible king bed room on a suite floor for the first night of our stay. The room's TV did not work and the shower was difficult to use and spilled out into the bathroom (though this was likely due to the fact that the room was an accessible room).  2. The casino though intimate and calm does not offer particularly differentiated gaming options. The poker room is not nearly active as those of its neighbors so I generally confined my play to the Aria.  3. The casino-level Starbucks often had an unwieldy line. I recommend making the 5-minute walk next door to the Starbucks in Caesars Palace's Forum Shops mall for your coffee fix.
40,Stayed 2 out of 3 nights here in February and cannot fault the staff or service we received. Everything is pricey but “hey it’s Vegas Baby!”. The hotel is genuinely beautiful and the wide variety of bars and restaurants cater for every taste and wallet.    The only fair criticism I can give is that upon our arrival from UK we were shocked to find that our rooms were unavailable due to an overbooking issue. The reasons given were typical; very busy holiday weekend booking is not controlled by the hotel itself etc. A disappointing start.    To resolve the problems we were graciously transferred to the Luxor for a night. Easy in principle but then to extend our already long journey to further transfers (there and back) then a further lengthy wait for the new hotel to process our change of accommodation brought us to breaking point. The hotel credited us $250 per couple and covered the cost of transfers. To our relief we finally made it to our rooms at Luxor close to midnight - 5 hours after having landed at 7pm.    The return to the Mirage and remainder of our stay went like clockwork.
10,WORST hotel experience we have ever had! We saved up for a romantic 48 hours gettaway to see 2 shows in Vegas and this Hotel ruined it. Paid for a room with a king bed arrived to be told there were non left. Had to argue with front desk who gave deplorable service to convince them to switch us the second night. Went up to our 2 queen bed room to discover a large patch of mold on the ceiling in the shower. Returned to the lobby had to waste another hour in line to be switched rooms. At this point the employee was slightly apologetic and offered to comp the 75$ resort fee for the weekend. Went up to the new room to discover a chunk of the bathtub missing and the tiles in the room stained and dirty. Having missed the show we were planning on seeingand since we were being switched to our king room the next morning we didnt complain and just stayed in it. Checked out the following morning so we could get the king room when it would be ready. Gentleman at the reception was the only staff member who showed any empathy guaranteed our king bed room would be held for us while we went hiking due to the previous night's fiasco told us to leave all our belongings with the bellhops and next time not to wait in line again just go to the members desk. We arrived back at 7pm wanting to get changed for that nights show. Front desk told us since we hadnt re-checked in at 4pm they had given our room away. My partner tried to get our bags from the bellhops to at least get changed in the lobby but they would release our stuff unless we had a room. An hour later management refused to meet with us at front desk saying no upgrade was available and that a food credit could be added to our account. We were being told to go to a show sweaty with no clothes no room and that some food credit would help us in some way. At this point I was in tears at front desk. So overall we were in Vegas for 48 hours 12 hours we didn't have a room spent 3 hours at front desk were switched to 3 different rooms and NEVER got the room we paid for. AVOID THIS PLACE!!!
50,A mid strip property top level accommodations and superior service. Enjoyed the convenience and location. The Hotel itself is well maintained and very clean the rooms nice though due for a carpet and soft goods update.
30,Check in was very fast our booked room type was no longer available and they offered to waive the resort fees which was a fair.  Not a fan of having to walk through the casino to get to the guest elevators and it is quite a trek to get there with luggage. The room was spacious and fairly nice. The bathroom however was tiny dated and the fan was really noisy. That was such a nuisance whenever we were showering.  The location was really good for our needs. Literally everywhere we took an Uber was less than $11.  The volcano show is outstanding and worth your time especially since it's free.  The dining options on the property are diverse and decent. We had the pizza from California Pizza Kitchen which was superb. The buffet was just OK although there are many better choices on the strip.  Housekeeping could have been a little better they cleaned the room but left a lot to be desired in the sense that there was dust on a lot of surfaces right after cleaning the drinking glasses were not adequately cleaned and I had to hand wash them before each use...an annoyance. If you are here to party for a night or two and will spend all your time on the strip then this property is just fine. However if you are pacing yourself and will be Vegas for more than 3 nights then there are better options on the Strip. Otherwise nothing too wrong with the Mirage but also nothing outstanding that would draw you there over most newer casinos.
30,"My now husband and I booked a stay at the Mirage for our wedding/honeymoon trip to Vegas. I had taken the ""virtual tour"" of the King Resort room on the Mirage's own website and it had shown beautiful decor plus a glass-enclosed shower and jacuzzi tub in the bathroom. My husband and I were really looking forward to soaking together in the jacuzzi tub after long walks around Vegas. After checking in and being assured the front desk gal had ""snagged"" us a great room with a ""pool view"" we arrived at our room and were very disappointed. There was a distant sideways view of the pool area but our main view consisted of a large ugly flat rooftop. The bathroom was TINY with only a small tub/shower combo in it. The room also had poor decor and smelled old and musty. We called down to the front desk to inquire about the fact this room did not match the online imagery and were told that we must have seen pictures of the King Resort Tower Suite - which they now had ""none of those rooms available"". I explained we were there for our wedding and honeymoon and after the front desk gal on the phone gave me some attitude she finally offered for us to move into one of the Stay Well rooms at a cost to us. The Stay Well room was adequate and smelled OK thanks to the air purifier but it lacked the luxury and romance we were seeking for such an important trip. We were disappointed not to have been offered a more expensive room with more luxurious features like we had been expecting. We definitely would have paid for a nicer upgrade! Beware when you're booking your room... The Mirage Hotel's website uses imagery from the King Resort Tower Suite when viewing their virtual tour for the standard King Resort room. We don't want you to be disappointed like us! Especially if you're also booking for such a special occasion."
40,Lovely hotel and had great service when ever needed. Breakfast was our only challenge. One restaurant which had a line that was endless and very pricey Starbucks or room service. Would have liked a better option. Otherwise we really enjoyed the location and the space. Thanks.
50,We stayed here for the last part of our honeymoon. When we arrived there were no king rooms left so we were offered some options and decided to settle with a room with two queen beds and an amazing view of the strip AND no resort fees.    Rooms were clean all staff we met were lovely. Beatles LOVE show was fantastic and tickets are discounted for hotel guests.    We only ate once at the hotel and used the Cravings buffet for breakfast. Which for $19 pp was really good value.    Location is really good noise levels considering where the hotel is were minimal.    We loved it and will come back when we come back to Vegas!
50,First time to Vegas & this hotel. Great hotel easy check in no que at the time we arrived :) very easy check out in lobby area :)    Loved the large fish tank behind reception & the Indoor waterfalls nice additions!    Lovely & clean in all area's especially the rooms. We had a king strip view room & it was very spacious. Cleaned every day & couldn't fault any part of our trip. Just don't touch the minibar unless you can afford it lol!    Hotel bar staff were great friendly with good banter always willing to help if you need anything :)    Great central strip location easy access to all areas :)    All in all a great trip for a few days & would recommend this hotel :)
20,Stayed at The Mirage for a long weekend and my first trip to Vegas with my new fiancé.    CHECK-IN:  We arrived at the hotel at about 10:30pm on a Wednesday and the line for check-in was longer than anticipated. The employee who ended up checking us in after about a 15-20 minute wait was courteous and apologetic.    THE ROOM:  Our room was very disappointing. It was on the fifth floor and smelled musty and had mold in the shower and a rusty drain that didn’t work (as some of the other reviewers have noted). I’m concerned for my poor lungs and all the mold and smoke it had to encounter over our stay. I’d rather have a place to store my drinks than a fridge that was full of overpriced unwanted beverages and wish the room fridge was empty. The bed was spring-y and it was really loud at night with the party animals roaming our hallways. The plug by the bed situation is unfortunate and dated because it’s the year 2020 and most of us want to be able to charge our phones by the bed. Housekeeping did not come to clean and we ourselves had to call to let them know they forgot our room (we did NOT have privacy sign up) and to request more towels and soaps at minimum. The iron barely worked. The carpet was gross. The room is so musty and smelly. Definitely makes you want to stay OUT of the room and exploring Vegas which I suppose is a plus.    AMENITIES:  I’m a gym person and the gym is decent. 30 minute maximum on the cardio equipment and the TV channels stop working if you’re running too fast. Otherwise gets the workout done. The casino is smoky but has a fun Derby horse game. Lovely restaurants - we even visited the new Diablo’s Cantina TWICE during our stay. The service was a little slow but the food was amazing and I still dream about my meal. We enjoyed the Dolphin Habitat and had a lot of fun but opted to not buy our $30 picture that they took of us and photoshopped with a baby tiger in our hands. The pool was closed for the season which makes me confused for why we still had to pay such an astronomical resort fee.    OVERALL IMPRESSION:  We were initially lured by the good reputation that The Mirage has and the fair prices. The location is central. However we would not return. We were disappointed by the overall experience and dated rooms and the high resort fees for not a lot of return on investment. Diablo’s and the dolphins were the best two parts of our stay. The Mirage needs to step it up.
20,This was my second time here but unfortunately I had 2 may be not that bad but not good at all first the air conditioned was not working fine I reported it and they fixed but juat reduce the heat the room qs never fresh the tv stop working  but the worst was the Resort fee that they justify with the internet well the wifi was never working conect in and disconect it saying was impossible to conect etc etc so I paid that charge (I know the qifibis just the justification but they said that was one of the reasons) but I couldn’t use it.
40,The strip location is perfect! You are right in the middle of it all. The hotel may be older but it is easy to navigate. We enjoyed our stay and had no issues with our room. The maid service was great. Everything worked as it should. Don’t touch the snacks or anything in the mini fridge it’s all weighted and you will be charged hefty prices! We were warned so we knew better! I would like it much better if they would get rid of all of that and leave any empty fridge so we could actually use it for storing our drinks and food.  We had 2 queens with a volcano and strip view. There were 4 pillows on each bed so that was nice. The beds were firm but I slept well. The window in the room actually opens we enjoyed being able to have fresh air. We went in February so there was a cool breeze.  The volcano went off every hour between 6pm and 11pm it is best viewed from the street. Seeing it from above isn’t that great. I didn’t realize it went off so late but it didn’t wake us up.  The bathroom only had one sink. The water is the hottest I’ve ever seen. It’s steaming within seconds. There is a tub/shower combo. I usually bring my own hairdryer but I was trying to pack light so I left it behind. I’m glad I did the hairdryer they provided was better than mine they had a Babyliss Pro. It worked great. There is also a makeup mirror attached to the wall. It was nice to have that.  If you haven’t heard of the MyVEGAS app you may want to download it and play for awhile. I’m not obsessed with playing but I did play off and on for a year and I built up enough points to redeem 3 nights at the mirage. The only thing I had to pay was the resort fees which totaled $125. I also redeemed a couple of BOGO buffets 2 tickets to the Secret Garden and a few more things. There’s no money involved you’re just playing slots within the MyVEGAS app.  We used Uber and you have to use the NORTH valet area not the valet at the main entrance. We got confused about that but there are signs for Uber so it was our fault.  This isn’t a fancy hotel but it’s a good place to stay. We enjoyed the perfect location. The pictures of the strip were taken from our room.
20,Booked room two months in advance when arrived placed in a dumpy room that was handicapped accessible except not handicapped. Requested different room and told too bad that is what we have available maybe you can move tomorrow however only here two nights. Room smells musty mold in shower. Also it’s an adjoining room which doesn’t feel safe as a solo women traveler. Never will I stay here again. Didn’t expect much just the room type I booked and basic cleanliness
40,I just completed a business trip and stayed in Mirage for the first time. The Hotel overall is good that's the reason I provide 4 stars. I guess I was on business trip plus I am not a gambler so my eyes are cool to catch something may not be the best to have.  1. everyone knows the hotel merchandise displayed in the room cost something Well they cost a lot. A Fuji bottle of water costs $18 at Mirage and the one across street at Walgreen costs less than $5.  2. Test your room electronic plug some are not working .  3. everyone loves Las Vegas Buffet Mirage's lunch buffet is at minimum. not many choices and varieties.  4. Hotel guest room section does not have the rule for midnight quietness you can hear people sing talk and slam doors.  5. Hotel staff is very friendly
30,Traveled to Las Vegas for a mini vacation and stayed at the Mirage Hotel casino.The mood was quickly destroyed by the Mirage Hotel.After traveling for almost 6 hrs by planeManagement said room was not ready.Took them almost 4 hours to let us have our room which meant the whole day was shot!the refrigerator in the room is fully stockedbut everything is a la carte and extremely overpricedSince it's full you can't use it unless you buy their products.If you have a car your stuck paying daily charge.I understand this a prime vacation destination but I think they go too far.The only bright spot was the maid service which was excellent.Future travelers should inquire about all the possible charges &fees before booking this or any other hotel in Vegas.Also make sure of check in times or you could be in for miserable travel experience!
50,We reserved a Resort Tower Room had a great stay overall. We would book it again in a heartbeat.    Perks: LOCATION price The Beatles LOVE show is in-house the resort has a cozy and less tony feel than some others and if you’re not a pro gambler you can still find some approachable tables ($10 and $15 blackjack tables).    Negatives: Typical Vegas casino hotel smell the room showed a little age in the bathroom (small signs of a previous mold issue) the hallway decor was a bit dated but overall functional and clean.    On previous trips to LV I’ve stayed at Bellagio (2x) Palazzo (1x) and the Mirage (1x). The Mirage is not as fancy as the others but it is totally fine if you aren’t a diva. It is an “older” hotel but overall it is amazingly well kept. We strolled through Treasure Island this time and it was noticeably less nice than The Mirage.    The main goals of this trip were to see a concert at The Colosseum (Caesar’s) gamble and shop (Forum Shops Fashion Show Mall). The Mirage Location was excellent for this; everything was easily within walking distance.    Originally I looked at booking a room at Caesar’s Palace but it was quite a bit more expensive this particular weekend. I’m glad we didn’t go that route because we walked through Caesar’s four different times and kept getting lost. That place is confusing- Mirage is much easier to navigate.
50,Very good hotel. Bedrooms roomy and everything supplied. Reasonable dining but none of the food in any of the restaurants was hot; always luke warm so not to my taste. Staff were excellentprofessional yet friendly
50,We were so impressed and lucky to be there. Originally had other plans illness caused us to reschedule everything and ended up luckin' out getting into the Mirage. It was gorgeous clean friendly and absolutely wonderful! problem free. We checked out the place we first had booked and were SOOOO happy we ended up at the mirage instead. Fabulous trip!
10,Upon arrival the hotel did not smell fresh and clean. Hotel very dated and dark.  We had constant difficulty opening room with key. The room was very dated. Room was dusty. Unnecessary Dust on headboards and furniture. You could not walk on floor or sit on chair due to cleanliness. Stains on furniture and headboard torn. Phone not plugged in. Rusty bath fixtures...  On third day we mentioned these concerns and was moved to another room. In that room the toilet would not flush properly. The bathtub would either not drain properly or tub would not fill for bath. We had med fridge that did not work and froze my insulin. Stains in that room too. Also tv didn’t work good.  I’m so surprised to read other reviews on guests having no complaints. We certainly did not experience a clean room. We stayed here based on reviews.  Truly disappointed. Was hoping for better. Will never return or recommend.
30,Rooms Where nice and Clean Wi Fi was not the Best very spotty  Buffet Dinner was not very well Stocked.  Front desk staff was top notch.  the walk to some of the rooms was very long we where at the end of a very long corridor
20,When I entered it as smelly stale smoke and cheap perfume. But those are the official scents of the Las Vegas strip. Got to the room no outlets by the bed. Called the operator to ask for an extension cord and they sent an engineer to move the mattress to plug my medical equipment in to an outlet under the bed. The shower l asked all over the floor. Cleaning was poor no new towels to replace the ones used to mop up the shower leakage no new soap etc.    Stay somewhere newer
40,It was a great stay. The hotel was right on the strip easy and convenient. Great service the room was roomy comfortable and clean bed was good bathroom was nice and clean. I would definitely good back and would recommend.
50,This is always a great stay and will stay here again. Comfortable friendly and of course the great shows. I’ve seen Terry Fator Love by the Beatles acrobatic show and the craps tables are always fun
50,First time staying at The Mirage in Las Vegas! The wife and I are here celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary courteous and friendly staff upon check in. The front desk staff named Freddy checked us in quickly and upgraded our room at no extra cost. We have a fantastic view of the Volcano and Strip! This hotel and Casino is very clean and easily accessible. Great views and fantastic service! I highly recommend!
40,"Second trip to Vegas with group of 6 we had 3 rooms. Booked The Mirage based on price and location. I was concerned would be a little further away from center of the strip but worked out perfectly! We had short walk to Caesar's and Treasure Island next door Venetian and the crazy complex by the Linq across the street. Walked from Mirage all the way to MGM grand and back - it was a haul but took up most of the day wandering in and out of places.    The hotel itself was very nice love the open atrium with actual daylight in a casino! Very nice tropical outdoors loved the volcano show at night and could see from our room above as well (note it's kinda loud in the room but last one is 11pm totally reasonable for Vegas hours). Rooms were standard but had good closet and drawer storage decent space on sink in bathroom for toiletries etc. Super strong shower water pressure which is good and pet peeve of mine in other hotels. Room isn't fancy not sure when last upgrades were but was clean and served it's purpose. Lots of USB plugs at desk and in bedside clock for all electronics.    Casino was like most of the other places nothing outstanding good or bad. The smoking inside makes me crazy everywhere in Vegas this was no exception. I will say our room - and all the floors in our section (floor 11 bank of elevators) were all nonsmoking which is much appreciated!!!    Restaurants all looked awesome but we only had time to eat at The Still. Cool bar/brewery area food was very good - have to go order at the ""food truck"" and they bring to table. Several of us had the chicken and rice bowl very good and nice healthier option than many places offer. Would love to go back and try Diablos and the sushi place too!    Booked spa appointments same day which was great. Have to show your room discount card but get 10% off. Did back neck shoulder massage for 25 min and an hour facial. Lovely spa facilities men's separate from women's both had multiple whirlpools sauna etc. and showers with all amenities. Was nice to hang out in a quiet place and take shower after services and before heading out for the evening. A spa is one of my favorite vacation activities and this was quite good!    Great trip very pleasant stay and would recommend again."
30,We came into Vegas late but checked into our room online before we got there. This is great considering the time we came in. We were under the impression that checking in before hand would speed up the process considering we just wanted to get to our room and relax.    When we came in there was a long line up and the online check in was closed. Which didn't speed anything up for us perhaps if they can't have anyone work this they should have a kiosk instead. I will say the line we waited in did move very quickly and David at the counter was very nice and gave us a later check out which we appreciated very much.    We were on the 15th floor a king size bed with a view of the pool mountains and a bit of the strip. The entry was big bathroom a bit small with poor lighting. The room did have a bit of a musty smell with a bit of wear and tear (wall paper ripped stains on lamps) . Not a huge deal but the room could definitely use some TLC. Location of room was quiet and the bed was extremely comfortable no extra pillows or blankets but had we stayed longer we would have asked front desk. Also making sure not to touch the mini bar anything you touch will be charged. We did encounter security going up to the room which was nice to know they were checking to see if you actually were staying there.    We didn't use any of the other amenities because we moved over to Paris for the rest of our time in Vegas.
50,Great location! One of my favorite MGM properties! This was our first stay here and we will be back! From check in to check out everything was amazing. Rooms area a good size and clean. House keeping was prompt daily and provided wonderful service. Pool was closed for seasonal maintenance but we were still able to sit poolside and enjoy the sunshine!
30,We stayed here nine nights. NINE nights in Las Vegas. That's the longest I've ever been in Vegas in...well forever. It was way too long but it was for work. Nine nights man. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry when we finally checked out. (Extra points if you can guess the movie that line's loosely based on.) ;)    Anyway - check in was okay. There was a long line when we finally got in around 8:30 pm on a Wednesday night. There were four or five desk agents up there but only one that was actually open and working. Once I finally got up to the front check in was pretty easy. They also let me know that some of the packages we'd been shipping to the hotel had arrived and gave me a map to find the in-house FedEx office.    Our room was large and very cold. We struggled with the thermostat the entire trip - though it said we had the heat cranked up to 78 it always felt cold. Or it would warm up for a bit just enough to stop the shivering then the temperature would plummet again.    We had two beds one was used for storage and staging for the day. The bed we slept in was comfortable but I ended up with a pillow fort because their pillows were so flat and not good for neck support.    We made excellent use of the desk during our stay (my husband more than me since our company had a mobile office onsite downstairs). Of the plugs closest to the desk only half of them actually worked and the USB ports didn't provide enough power to charge things.    The bathroom was big and clean-ish...It had a decent amount of counter space and I liked the way the toiletries smelled. The tissue box was not full when we arrived which meant we ran out of tissues on our first day. It took two days and a note requesting more tissues for it to be replaced.    There was one large area on the hotel's credenza that we steered well clear of. Their room bar is one of those weighted versions; moving a package even by accident will trigger a payment hitting your room bill. I wasn't about to accidentally knock something over - I didn't want to have to 'splain that to my finance person!    The room definitely had enough storage and stretching out space which we took full advantage of. The walls were thick enough to where we only once heard a group of happy (and likely drunk) people storm through the halls. We got decent sleep here despite the freezing temperatures and the paper-thin pillows.    The rest of the hotel/casino was just as cold as the room even in January. Maybe they thought the arctic chill would kill any cold germs floating around. They were wrong.    At any rate it's a decent hotel for a long stay but not my favorite in the city. Still it had everything we needed for the trip - both personally and professionally - even if we didn't agree with the prices on said needed things. And I'm glad to say that the WiFi was fast. I think our Dublin hotel scarred me but it was nice to be connected to something quick and reliable.
20,Trying to get a detailed print out of our bill is absolutely impossible. The front desk gives you only a summary and you’re expected to assume charges and credits are applied. Their attitude is unbelievable. They tell you they do not have to provide you a detailed statement showing your credits and you’re expected to assume they’ve been applied.    Brutal brutal brutal.
40,I have been to Vegas several times but never stayed at the Mirage. We went for the Super Bowl and looked for the best deal on the strip. Mirage put us in an above-average room at a better rate than most of the basic rooms at other places. It was clean and staff was friendly. They may be in for an upgrade soon based on all the newer shiner properties but maintained well. No complaints.
20,We ended up walking down to the Walgreens on the strip to buy some coke for the hotel room.  It was 2.49 compared to $ 5 bucks a bottle in the Mirage. Ridiculous  ( didn't even get a refrig in the over $200 a night room)  Hotel did seem clean and it was very quiet at night to sleep. Great beds and decent pillows.
10,Pains me to say but we stayed here on our honeymoon and found out the staff were spying on us! Yes spying!!!  They had removed the peep whole from the door so you could see straight in!  I complained with the night manager and he couldn’t care less! Didn’t deny it or did he care about customer service!  For that alone I STRONGLY advise you stay somewhere else. There’s plenty of amazing places in Vegas.... you deserve better than the Mirage!
20,The rooms are outdated service and food quality at the restaurant The STILL was extremely poor (mind you for 16 our bill was $1200). Ridiculous EXTRA charges at the business center to pick up golf clubs and ship golf clubs out. If I had the choice I wouldn’t come back to the Mirage.
50,You know there is expensive casinos and others with fare price. Well The Mirage is the best casino with fare price for sure! We loved the casino the restaurants the bars the location. The rooms are nice... We really enjoyed our stay. Will go back for sure!
50,Very clean and lots of nice amenities. All restaurants on sight had decent tasting food with many choices. The Beatles Love show was an amazing on sight attraction we would recommend to everyone. We will stay again the next time in Vegas.
50,Great place except for resort fees which cost more than the room I did not use any of the amenities in their agreement although it was a pretty decent place to stay casino restaurants volcano show etc
40,I had never stayed at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas until last October. We upgraded to a Volcano view room and found it to be fantastic!! The hotel was perfect with all you need under one roof. It is centrally located on the Strip allowing easy access to all key attractions. I would definitely stay here again as long as the value was right.
40,We had a twin room at the rear of the hotel which looks out across a more industrial landscape. This includes a railroad track which brings with it the iconic sound of American locomotives honking down the line. Being single glazed you will hear both the trains and aircraft flying out of McCarran Airport. Some may find the rooms stuffy generally the AC is pretty chilly so you want to set it to whatever suits you. One last item is the condensation on the windows and sills and the mould forming in some spots Those are the negatives. Moving onto more positive items. The pool area is pleasant with lots of planting and palms and has waitress service from the pool bar. There are a good selection of restaurants and bars within the hotel we liked The Still which jad a great bgeer selection and served some amazing Korean Hot Wings. We also used the Spa which is $30 for days use for hotel guests the wet area is great with a good Jacuzzi steam room and Sauna (hotbox). Generally quite a spacious Casino and the layout is far less confusing to navigate than many of its neighbours. I would recommend if your budget is tight the locaiton is very good and the staff are very helpful and courteous.
50,Great hotel and perfect location . It was right in the center close to everything. Parking was easy and checkin was very fast. Hotel rooms were clean. Hope they add fridge and microwave in the room. Over all it was amazing experience. Will definitely go back to stay there
20,Room was stuffy. Customer service didn’t exist. The Casino was nice and helpful. The bathroom in the rooms were very small. I made a complaint about the shower. This is the fourth time I’ve been to Vegas and my 100th time in a hotel. This is for sure in my bottom five overall. I expected more I will not be staying here again.
40,The Mirage is a Vegas staple. It use to be one of the premiere hotels on the strip with the famous volcano infront. I still like the Mirage but the rooms need an upgrade they are adequete but small and could use some work. The casino itself is nice sportsbook is huge if youre looking to watch a game or place some bets. Recommend Diablos if you want mexican food it is very very good. Good location on the strip across from the Venetian and close to many other hotels.
40,The water in the hotel Room was either super hot or super cold could not get warm out of the faucets. TV was smaller and a little blurry. Otherwise the staff was excellent and except for some longer lines at the restaurants everything was well done.
50,First time at this hotel. Would definitely return. Over service from the front desk to the Mlife desk was great. Being part of the MGM group and offering the veteran discount make our stay even more affordable. Centrally located make the Mirage even better. Would recommend highly.
30,The smell of casino smoke is too strong and the hotel room is too far from the entrance so the minibar charges automat.The hotel buffet is more average.I will never choose the hotel anymore. It is not good for family to stay.
30,This was my 10th visit to Las Vegas and first trip staying at the Mirage. The room wasn't up to par lines for coffee in the morning were outrageous at the two places that offered coffee service. Poor signage as it relates to vaping/smoking. Watched security over-react and go on a power trip beating up a man in the slot area. There are better hotels for this price point on the strip.
30,room Amenity charges were on my final bill. We did not touch any room amenities and that was extremely disturbing. It should clack of honesty in part of room accounting staff.. This will deter me to book Mirage again.
50,Location is in the middle south of the strip. Things to see and do right at the hotel. Nice quality gift shops. Not so crazy about the Buffet dining room atmosphere but food selection was good. Pantry and Still restaurants great tasting food.
40,My First time staying here and I wasn’t disappointed. The room was nice the bathroom needs done work though. There seemed to be black mold in the caulking. The casino was nicely laid out and not too large that you had to walk a mile to get places. I liked how the hotel is central to all the other hotels shopping and food. The best part was seeing Boyz II Men who have a residence here. Their show was fantastic!!
40,My wife and I spent my Birthday at this establishment and it was a great experience overall. The service was phenomenal and staff were friendly especially the housekeeping crew who made us feel like we were home.  The only disappointment we had was the WiFi black spot in our room (which had the best view of the strip by the way. I was not able to connect my MacBook to the room WiFi and tech support were not able to resolve this. They promised to escalate the issue and to get back with me but never did!! This was a great inconvenience to us as I had to use my cellular hot spot and the in-house Starbucks’ WiFi to submit my work report!
50,Great Location. Many restaurants inside as well as around Hotel. Did not experience noise disturbances during sleeping hours. Staff were very knowledgeable. Variety of food at buffet. Recommend joining the Mlife Rewards program.
10,Front desk staff including the manager was extremely terrible with no help pushing out the responsibility and never listen to the customers. They are so rude. It’s the worse hotel that I had stayed in Las Vegas.
50,60th birthday trip a great stay! Haven't stayed at Mirage for 10 years but it was as good as we remembered! The staff is friendly and helpful. Rooms are clean and spacious. We can't wait to come back.
50,We loved the Mirage. They upgraded us to a huge suite for no charge. The staff was great and the hotel had everything one could need. The location is perfect you can walk to all the attractions . One suggestion is when checking out go early as the line up can get very long and slow.
50,Trip #27 to Vegas and never stayed before at an MGM property. The moons aligned and we chose the Mirage. Just over 30 years old this place was incredible. And no BS here I was on the road the previous 9 days on Route 66 and stayed at chains including Days Inn Motel 6 Quality Inn and Super 8 it made the Mirage shine even more!    The pool that was open was warm the hot tub hot and plenty of sunshine (1/25-1/28). The room was a welcome retreat for relaxation after days of driving. First am getting great room service and a powerful bathroom. Actually the shower curtain bar was loose and the maid called for us and it was repaired as we returned from lunch. Plenty of good shops (bummed I forgot to get a Mirage polo) and we sampled Cravings CPK Osteria Costa and Diablo Cantina. All excellent and individually reviewed in TA with pride.    Very happy staff here from the patient valet team as we unloaded so much from the car to no tbreaking or dropping anything getting it to the room. Decent views looking south and the aquarium channel is relaxing. (better then the fireplace). Friendly dealers solid 007 slots and an all around great stay. Also I loved getting for once the proper credit for my in-house spending and ended up at Pearl Level. Not sure what to do just yet but living 40 minutes from Atlantic City it may be time to return to the Borgata for some dinners. Incredible stay and yes I would return.
50,Just a quick reminder if the outstanding service by all. From check in to check out was simply flawless. I defintiley would recommend your facility to family and friends visiting the area in the future. Thank you for all that you do each and every day to ensure outstanding customer satisfaction.
30,Mirage was convenient for our business travel but is just average. Dining options limited and expensive for the value received. The resort fee is bogus - should be included in the room rate since you can't opt out of it. Added $37.00 + taxes a night.
40,I and my wife were at the hotel/casino for three days.The entire time I was gaming I never received a beverage. I waited 45 minutes for a drink but never received itmost of the time I was never asked.Anytime I wanted a drink I payed $10 at the store inside the casino
40,Hotel room fab twin queen beds view over the volcano. Room tidied every day. Downside is this daily room tax!! Plenty to eat and drink here plus some nice shops and shows. Pool being worked on but little pool open.... sunny and warm sun beds comfy.... defo busier as weekend approaches..... beltway location middle of the strip.
40,Decent hotel-Great restaraunts Steak house was amazing Carnegie Deli was also very good. Gambling was fun Gave plenty of options from 25 cents slots upwards Good location on the strip walking distance to everything
40,get a way trip for some Vegas excitement. Disappointed in the Mirage's new marker credit policy whe the no longer give you cash but a playing voucher to be used ONLY at the Mirage. RIDICULOUS NEW RULE !!!
40,Had a great trip with the family. Not too smoky in the casino. Loved the crepe/frozen yogurt shop! The kids enjoyed seeing the tigers and dolphins. The staff was attentive the room was clean and spacious! It was a good stay for us!
30,Room 23-061  View is alright and quiet enough. No sunset or sunrise view though.  Check in was ok but customer service was hit and miss. Mostly miss.    Checked in jan 27 for 7 nights (3 reservations linked) and it's our anniversary on Feb 1.  Also we are both Platinum Mlife members.    Platinum room upgrade fail.  Asked if there was an upgrade available she said no.  She offered suite upgrade to couple in front of us for $75/nt gave it to them for $50/night.  But for us they have nothing available- eventhough it's our anniversary.    Then I had to call the front desk as they don't have enough outlets in the room. They have a lamp by the window not plugged in - because they dont have enough plugs.    Husband sleeps with a cpap machine and there are NO plugs at either beside table.  Asked for an extension cord front desk advised that they dont have any and all the rooms are the same so I cant have a different room.  Strike two.    So we have the cpap and cleaner plugged into the foyer plug and have to use a chair to reach the plug. Pretty ghetto.    Today no room cleaning.  Strike 3.  We were out all morning came back at 1pm still no cleaners.  When we left again at 4pm cleaners in the hall but ignored our room.    Add to this the fact that the bathroom fan makes noise but does not work - it takes nearly an hour to work actually.    The bed is super soft.  So much so that i have been limping when i walk due to sore back for the past 2 days.    Overall it's a hotel.  The room is average. Customer service isn't great and we wont be back.    5th trip to vegas and worst service yet.  We've stayed at Bellagio MGM Grand Excalibur and Park MGM before now.  Would choose any of them over Mirage.  Or Caesar's properties across the street.    Not a great Anniversary trip.  Live and learn    We could go anywhere and stay anywhere for our anniversary and I convinced my husband to stay at the Mirage.    Based on this trip wont do it again.
40,Just one of the more basic hotels on the strip. Not a ton to do but enough. better than most hotels. Out of the 20 hotels I've stayed at on the strip Mirage sits around #6. Its not fancy like Cosmo or Aria but way nicer than Treasure island or Planet hollywood. Ill stay here again.
50,The Casino hotel is in a great location on the strip lots of great restaurants. Plenty of craps tables and space to play with great staffing. Everyone was so nice. Mlife is a great program. live in Cle and you just bought the casino here. I will start going as soon as you get table games here.
30,There are nicer places to stay on strip for less.We were not really welcomed at the desk.A king room was not available which we had booked!We were offered an upgrade with a king bed for 30 extra a night!Should have been given to usnot great.Next we asked for a strip room not easy but got it.Room had rusty drains old dirty office furniture.Beds were ok !
50,This was our first stay at the Mirage. We went for a comedy show at The Terry Factor. Easy to deal with picking up tickets and check in. Valet was friendly and service was quick. Bartender at Stack was amazing.
40,We visited the Mirage while in Las Vegas. It is a nice hotel located right on the strip. They have a “volcano” eruption each night on the grounds.    The casino is nice as well. The grounds are well maintained and the area around the volcano is populated by water birds such as ducks.    We visited the hotel to see Siegfried and Roy’s Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat located in the back side of the hotel grounds.
20,The room was very basic and dirty and dusty. The money I spent however was A LOT. The elevator is far from the main lobby and the keys get you to your floor. It's a long walk with bags to find out your keys dont work which happened to me. Mobile check in did not work either.
40,Great location for this hotel on the strip. Staff is friendly  beds are comfortable and self parking is reasonable at $14 a night . You can also park at several other hotels with the same key at no additional costs.  The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is the price for the water in the room. If you pick up a bottle off the tray it releases a sensor so weather you drink it or not you are charged $18 for that bottle . They tell you this on ck in
10,Wouldn't stay here again. For the price the hotel is very run down and the rooms are very outdated (more like a motel).    Also had a very bad experience with customer services (and my issue was more or less ignored.    Avoid.
50,My stay at the Mirage was truly exceptional. the cigarette smoke at the casino was not overwhelming and staff was very nice and friendly. Also the food at the Pantry was exceptional. I would recommend a stay at this beautiful hotel.
30,We stayed at The Mirage on Friday and Saturday night January 24/25 with check out on Sunday. We were staying on a comp room promotion (only paid the resort fee); however I will review just as if we were paying regular price (which we normally do in Vegas).    This was my first time ever staying at the Mirage. We checked in on Friday night at about 10pm. We were able to use the shorter line because we had an upgraded M life status. Without the no wait check-in the line was approximately 30 minutes for check-in.    The Mirage common areas are as beautiful as ever. The casino floor is lovely the atrium garden area the fish tank behind the front desk etc. Parking is plentiful in the garage (which is now a pay garage)    We did utilize the fitness center on one of our two mornings and it is well equipped clean and very nice. (This is included with your resort fee)    We were on the second floor in Room 2-030. Of course the room was a bit odd being directly above the roof level; however no big deal.    The room was pretty nice. Yes you can tell that many areas of the room are in need or will soon be in need of a refresh! The carpet was coming up in some areas the bed needed some TLC the in-room chair needed some TCL etc. However overall the room was pretty pleasant. The room was clean to our standards.    The hotel does not give you a clear check-out time. Usually we check out around 8 or 9am; however on this trip we wanted to stay a little bit later. We were not told about check-out time and none of the documentation we were given said the check-out time. There was a sign posted in the closet of the room (by the safe) that check-out time was 12noon.    We did not require housekeeping service during our stay; therefore our privacy door hanger stayed on our room from 10pm Friday evening until 11:05am on Sunday morning. At 10:10AM on Sunday morning there was a loud knock on our door and housekeeping tried to enter. We came to the door and he said he really needed to get additional rooms done before his lunch break and he was wondering if we were ready to leave. He told us check-out time is 11:00am. He was disappointed when we told him we would be leaving around 11:15am.    OK so here is the downturn of the trip! The sign in the room says 12noon check-out. We asked another employee on the way out and they said check-out time was 11:00am. No big deal --- because we left at 11:05am anyway. HOWEVER in no circumstance should housekeeping be persuading us to leave the room long before check-out time. I understand it can be frustrating for housekeeping to not have rooms to do as they want to finish there shift as soon as possible; however if the privacy sign is on the door and it is long before check-out time there is no need to go room to room to try to persuade people to leave.
20,Went to Vegas with 5 other couples for vow renewal called in advanced and requested same floor for all 6 couples. Our flight was late night so when we got there they said no more room and sent us to the very bottom floor. I was not happy they refunded only $41.00 & promotions is next day they’d have a room on the top went next day to desk and they started to give me the run around again. I had to get angry in order for them to “suddenly” find a room on that floor. By the way they need to remodel all the rooms very dated!! I will not stay there again.
40,Last time I stayed was 10 years ago. You can see the wear and tear of the resort. Room was clean and spacious enough but furniture and rug was dated. Service was fine. Didn't have a lot of interaction but check in was great. Kim has been with Mirage since the opening and he was fantastic finding an alternative to what we had originally booked. Poker room is nice and well run. Food options were good but very sad to see the Carnegie Deli closing soon. I hope they put in another reasonably priced food place and not another high priced restaurant. Now that they don't have the burger place the options for (relatively) cheap eats there are dwindling.Took advantage of the pool/hot tub so that was nice that is was still open in January. Mirage is still one of my favorite resorts on the strip for the price point but they need to upgrade the room category we were staying in. (standard King)
20,Ok I get there’s a bazillion hotels on the strip and I get they’re all competing for our hard earned dollar. Here’s where the racket comes in so consider this a PSA for this particular hotel. NO COFFEE POT IN THE ROOM. If you’re a coffee drinker be prepared to spend $8 or more for that jolt of caffeine before you hit the slots. Also....DO NOT I REPEAT....DO. NOT open the refrigerator in your room. It is not for public use and if you even TOUCH anything inside that refrigerator get ready for a whopping check-out invoice that you’ll have to take a loan out to pay. If you need to refrigerate insulin they will bring you a suitable refrigerant for your life saving medicine so under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you open that refrigerator door. The goodies on top of the refrigerator area are also rigged to get charged to your account if you touch them....I mean....don’t even slide them closer together to make more room for your water you purchase at Walgreens! That’s the only place I’ve found where bottled water is less than $12.
20,Room was pretty gross. Smelled like sweaty feet. My view was literally a concrete wall. They should lock this particular room up and not allow anyone to subject themselves to the terrible stench. Disappointing stay
50,The stay well room was great! Very Zen like. It smelled great very peaceful. Great 60th Birthday!! My only negative is that they charge for parking!!! Why should we pay for parking when we are already a guest at the hotel!!!!
30,So I was expecting to hate this hotel based on other review - it was a work trip for a conference so I had no choice about where to stay - but actually it was OK!    Checkin was fine although you have to provide a credit card even if you do not wish to charge to the room. I heard colleagues talk of trying to be sold a room upgrade quite aggressively (not good when your company has already paid for rooms) but I did not experience this myself.    The room was spacious and clean and the only noise I heard was from the corridor (massive gap under door that a bolster pillow muffled a little) and from the annoying buzz of the minibar fridge. Housekeeping did a good job every day no issues with cleanliness replacement of towels etc. Bed was super comfy too had no issues with a good night sleep.    The main issue with the room was the shower. A chest high fixture so impossible to stand over and virtuall no water pressure. It took me about 10 minutes to rinse shampoo out of my hair with the shower head held about me - not great. Decent hairdryer though!    Food was generally good with lots of different price point options. Ate in the Still (weird sytem for ordering where you get table service for drinks but not for food and they can't be billed together) and the Pantry for breakfast. Beware huge portion sizes! The buffet food was generally OK nothing special but then you wouldn't expect it to be! Most of the food places are around the edge of the casino where smoking is allowed so be aware that you will not escape smoke when eating.    The gym is tiny for such a large hotel too - at 5am (with jetlag and before the conference start time of 8) every single machine was in use. Gym kit horribly overpriced too - $110 for some basic leggings....    Staff were a bit Meh. Just doing their jobs no-one seemed welcoming but also did nothing to really annoy me!    Beware the line for storing baggage too - took me 30 minutes just to leave a bag for the day although fortunately no queue when i went to retrieve it.    Location is good for touring other hotels too - the volcano show is cool but nothing much else to keep you within the Mirage during the evening...
20,Been coming here for years. After this trip we will start looking around. Room was dated but clean. GFI in bathroom kept popping. Room never made up before 3-4 pm. Food was horrible at buffet. Always thought it was difficult to ruin breakfast but they managed. Diablo’s was even worse never mind the service. Cold coffee really? Tables and slots were so tight it was not enjoyable. I never plan on winning but at least I should be able to lose a little slower. I am shocked always staying at the Mirage. Even brought my staff of 20 here twice. Yeah very disappointed
40,The Mirage is a beautiful resort/hotel. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The food is good for the value. I had no complaints. It was a really great experience for it being my first time at The Mirage! Thank you for a great experience!
40,The rooms are great. Nice clean and comfortable. Our room was over the strip and overlooking the Volcano show.  The restaurants and shops were good especially the buffets in Cravings.  Beware though.  Smoking is aloud in the casino and was not very nice if you’re a non smoker like us.
50,Staying here was so comfy the bed was amazing the shower was ok but better than LA casino was clean didn’t feel unsafe pool was clean pity you had to pay to see the tigers onsite restaurants ad bars were filling location was perfect got to see BOYZ II MEN live on site in one of the function rooms highly recommend staying. We will be back
30,This was our sixth time in Las Vegas but first stay at The Mirage. The online check in was efficient and our room was a nice size. Although we had booked a pool view our view was of the Trump hotel. Every morning at this hotel I awoke to stinging red eyes. It was so bad I had to go to CVS to get drops for my eyes and I tried to stay outdoors as much as possible. I also coughed a lot and had to use my inhaler multiple times a day! During our stay my husband’s room keycard fell out of his pocket. While searching for it  he lifted the cushion of the large chair in our room only to find a cigarette under the cushion. So much for a non smoking room! We will be back to Las Vegas in April but we will be staying at another hotel.
20,Escalator from bridge to registration level didn't work so had to cross uneven pavement in busy entry drive on knee stroller to enter hotel from parking garage. Keys didn't work upon check-in or in parking garage with pre-paid parking; casino carpet is filthy; housekeeping never removed drink glasses from casino brought up to room; security never showed up when woman urinated and defecated in parking space next to me while waiting for my friend AND talking to front desk; while hotel staff cannot control behavior of another guest no one called later to check on us or offer passes to Secret Garden or a couple free drinks - old Vegas class is gone! Edges of gaming tables were dirty and sticky. Heritage Steakhouse food was not a good as in the past.
10,Dolphins in captivity is illegal in some countries but the Mirage boasts about a tiger cage and a dolphin pond. No one with a conscience should consider staying at this facility until they change their attitude toward using animals for entertainment.
30,The room conditions and cleanliness were great. The Mirage property has many great amenities to provide most if not all visiting the property.  I will say that the casino of Mirage does not payout well as compared to other casinos. Strike it up to luck of the draw maybe but we seemed to come out of other casinos with more jingle in out pockets than when we were at Mirage. When leaving Mirage casino no jingle.
10,whilst staying this week at mirage 4 of uswe where both overcharged on checking out so queried it and got a refund of 30 dollars eachalso i paid cash for my account and then then charged my visa card as wellwhen i informed them yesterday they rembursed me but i have lost out by £20 because of there transaction chargesi never gave them my consent to charge my card in the first place they are so arrogant they need to go on a customer service coursewhen trying to use one bar in the hotel on sunday we (guests) where told we had to spend at least 50 dollars a head to have a drink.........what a rip off i would advise guests not to stay at this resort they are only interested in milking you!!
20,The room we paid extra to be “upgraded” to was old and looked like a low end hotel room not a Vegas strip room. We travel frequently and this was the worst room I’ve stayed in by far. The door didn’t shut properly so we had to shake the handle up and down to be sure it shut behind us each time we left. I would not stay here again.
10,My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary and this was by far the worse stay we’ve had in Las Vegas The rooms keys didn’t even work before we could get to our room the room smelled like mildew they moved us but not without attitude. My parking key would allow me out of the parking garbage but would not let me in I had to change my keys 4 times before we had even really settled in. Housekeeping would never leave us new washcloths so we had to call or ask a housekeeper on the floor to get us washcloths. The escalators to the parking garage didn’t work the entire 5 nights we were there and my parking keys never seemed to work I say I had to change them over 8 times it was getting pretty ridiculous! Lastly the staff and some guest made my wife and kid unwelcome at the pool. It was really sad guest shouldn’t go through these things when they spend over 220 dollars a night plus resort fees and parking fees!
20,I feel there is a need for me to represent all the guests that are visiting and staying at MGM Resorts to speak up on their behalf on this Mandatory Resort Fees that we are required to pay for upfront to be removed completely. I hope the Executive Decision Makers at MGM Resorts to re-consider the removal of this Mandatory Resort Fee and provide a more affordable and welcoming vacation place for their guests so they can take away a more Enjoyable Experience from their visit. THANK YOU in advance
50,No its not its a real Casino Resort one of the few remaining in the old school style where staff are congenial friendly and the service rocks!  Go to the High Rollers bar put $20 bucks in the slot poker machine and enjoy a cocktail with Johnny Depp's Doppleganger. You wont be disappointed
40,"Room was spotlessly clean throughout our 7 day stay had a tiny issue with the fittings (small rips in headboard) but sizeable enough and the bed was very comfortable.    Check In was quick and efficient the young lady on reception friendly to boot.    Key drop for check out was quick and billing spot on to include correct application of $30 daily resort credit.    Food:    Breakfast Buffet: average would rather pay similar for a sit down with a regular menu.    Carnegie Deli: overpriced sandwich shop big on size average of quality.    California Pizza Kitchen: wanting a takeaway for the room I say ""can't go wrong with a pizza can come back to it for breakfast"". Errr no. Abysmal. Just no taste to either of the pizzas we took due to a lack of sauce and toppings added cold after baking.    The Still: Sports bar with a decent range of beers and excellent quality bar food served from a separate canteen at the back. Best nachos I've ever had. On the way in to the hotel from the strip opposite Harrah's there is a guy occasionally giving out 2 for 1 drink tickets so there's value there also.    The Pantry: This is an all day place which was always popular for breakfast (big lines when we wanted to eat) so we only had lunch here the once. Burger and chips were bang average there is miles better elsewhere.    Gambling:  Unsure about the slots but you would have to be drunk/ a lunatic to play roulette (3 greens together on the wheel) or Blackjack (6/5).  Sportsbook is very good.    To conclude I would stay here again if the price was right the rooms and service were spot on. The only place I would spend gambling money is the Sportsbook the only places I would drink/ eat The Still and Starbucks."
50,Went for my brother's bachelor party. Spent three nights and had a great time. Rooms are clean and the service was great. Breakfast buffet was awesome but I probably wouldn't go there for dinner. Maybe the dinner buffet is better on the weekend.
50,So happy Becoz they upgraded my 2 bedroom reservation for 2 bedroom Penthouse for an affordable price. Hope I can do that again on my next trip ( September). The lady receptionist is absolutely helpful!
50,My family stayed here and was a great experience. Check-in and check-out process was easy. Parking lot has easy access right on to the casino floor. It's located centrally to be able to go to Bellagio water show and their own volcano show. I would recommend this place since it has restaurant within and in close vicinity.
50,This is my fourth stay at The Mirage and it is outstanding. The location is excellent and the staff is very friendly. When I stay during the summer months I enjoy the pool scene for it is clean fun and enjoyable.
50,We recently spent 4 nights at the resort and loved it. The room was nice clean and ab awesome view overlooking the volcano! Could not have asked for a better view. Just note there are snacks and drinks in the room. The tray in which the snacks are in have a sensor as well as the mini fridge. Therefore if you remove an item you will be charged for it. To avoid accidentally being charged we asked that the snacks be removed and purchased our own drinks and snacks from Walgreens and CVS.  The resort has several great restaurants lounges and outdoor lounge with heated areas.  The customer service and willingness to provide excellent service did not go unnoticed. Due to a storm in our hometown area our flight was changed and so we had to stay an additional night. We were concerned that we were going to be left without a room specially because there were so many people in town to see the McGregor fight which meant many resorts were practically sold out. However many thanks to Alex one of the managers at the resort who was so helpful in accommodating us for the additional night.    We loved our stay at the resort and look forward to staying there again in the future.
50,This is Almost 200 characters now hopefully but Yay for the Mirage was awesome and we loved it. We stayed for 3 nights. Nope not quite 200 characters. Oh the towels kinda smelled like cheese. That’s about it
40,Got a good deal via MLife and had a good time. Room was decent check-in easy and very good sports book. Also good location to check out other parts of Vegas strip from.    Didn't look too much at dining and it seems like other casinos give you more on-site from that side. But if that doesn't matter it's worth staying at.
10,Rooms needs to refurbished. Bathroom was dirty and moldy. They are old and need to be updated. Had booked a strip view but was disappointed. Restaurant selection is average. Only positive was the volcano show.
50,I had a good time in Vegas The Mirage is in the middle of everything great location and good deal the only thing that they need to improve is their entertainment they have one fancy Hip Hop club and that is it They need a few different type of clubs to attract and keep more people inside the hotel.
20,Room 16107 Room was too warm and could not get below 72F until 5 AM Tub/shower would not drain shower head was rusty shower curtain had dirty smell to it. These were all fixed after called in.In main room drapes were torn in a few places venier was lifting off counter edge and only a hole in bath door where a hook should have been. Not sure I would stay here again.
50,What a great place to stay. We were in the middle of everything and able to walk to all other hotels. Great volcano show every night on the hour. We were given a room with a view. Beatles Love show was amazing! Staff were friendly and room and casino kept tidy. Great price for pur travel package. We saved $900 staying here versus Venetian and still were able to walk across street to enjoy all if Palazzo/ Venetian. Check in was easy and staff so pleasant. Check out was online and also easy. Highly recommend this resort and will stay here again.
10,Within minutes of arriving at The Mirage my wife's credit card was somehow duplicated and $6000 was spent by the fraudster at her expense at the hotel. In other words there's an agressive fraud ring operating out of The Mirage.
50,I payed $20/night to upgrade to a Tower King room with a Strip/Volcano view. Was easily worth it. The rooms are starting to show signs of wear but I really like the warm tones and lighting in contrast to stays in rooms in resorts like the Delano and Planet Hollywood where stark white and gray color schemes make the rooms appear cold and sterile. This room was warm and inviting and this carried over to the rest of the grounds with the beautiful atrium. Stopped in for a very late meal at the Pantry. Expected overpriced dinner fare but was surprised at the high quality and portion size of the meal. It was really good! Finding the parking garage may be a bit tricky for those not already familiar with the area but I really appreciate the close proximity and short walking distance to and from the resort (in comparison to some other MGM properties ie MGM Grand and Aria and Vdara if one doesn’t have free access to valet services). Beatles Love was entertaining though not my favorite Cirque show. My wife enjoyed a pedicure and massage in the spa. Had a wonderful stay and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend the Mirage based on its location and everything else previously mentioned if you can find a good deal. The one fairly irritating negative would be their WiFi as it was completely useless... especially annoying due to it being used as an excuse to charge their resort fees (nothing new as almost all other Vegas resorts do this).
30,Does not meet the standards that many of the newer hotels have. Small Rooms Smaller Bathrooms etc... Curtains were stiff as if something was spilled on them and never cleaned up bedding was dirty with black marks on it. The Casino and Hotel are all nice the rooms are not worth the money.
50,Trip was great. Staff was friendly. Rooms could use some updates but overall stay was awesome. Mirage location is pretty central to the strip and right next to Ceasars and the Venetiean which was a huge plus for us!
40,Attended CES - great hotel right on the strip. Close to all activities for CES  Lots of food variety on site + Starbucks  Shops were nice  Casino floor was good - I am not a big gambler but did play the slots  Very clean  Walking distance to a lot of things as you are on the main strip  Pool was closed - I suspect it was their off season so were cleaning it  Would stay here again
50,We used a comp from the myvegas games on our phone. They are all part of mlife. Would recommend because this was the best hotel stay we have had in Vegas by far. Excellent location everyone we interacted with was very friendly. And when we did have an issue with the tub not draining it was fixed fast and given passes for the secret garden which we highly recommend.
50,I was pleasantly surprised by my stay at the Mirage. After previously staying at the Cosmo Bellagio and the Venetian I wasn’t sure what to expect after such a reasonably priced reservation. I paid less at the Mirage even after upgrading to a suite. The suite was fabulous although slightly dated. Bed was very comfortable only complaint would be the pillows but who sleeps much in Vegas anyway? The location of the Mirage is perfect!
50,Excellent Service and Location.  Rooms were nice and clean. Casino and Hotel well maintained. All Staff were extremely Helpful and Polite.  Will be planning another trip in future to The Mirage.  Enjoyed the Slots as well as Poker and Blackjack Tables.
20,VERY DIFFICULT time checking in. When I checked in at the desk all of a sudden I was charged an extra $100 on deposit. I was told when I made the reservation that this deposit was optional. The email I got confirming the reservation also only showed an owing of $125 for resort fee for a 3 day stay period. The manager Jesus was unwilling to provide written documentation of the necessary deposit stating only that all hotels charge a deposit and that it was required. That seems VERY shady to me that a hotel cannot provide written documentation of what charges a person will incur upon check-in.    Further this resort is NOT ADA friendly. Both the south entrance and the main entrance have doors equipped to open for those in wheelchairs yet the actuators did not work. My fiancee is in a wheelchair and at least twice she had to ask someone for help holding doors open because the ADA required doors did not work. If you use any kind of assistive mobility device stay away from the Mirage.    The only reason the property got higher than 1 is that housekeeping staff is courteous and friendly and the job that they did in cleaning our room prior to check in was superb. At least the room we stayed in was clean despite the unprofessional desk staff.    As such I will not stay at an MGM property ever again.
50,Really enjoyed my stay here except for the use of my rewards points! If you go there it’s clean secure and very cozy! I would like to see hotels WITH COFFEE IN THE ROOMS like in the past!! No one wants to get out of bed and search for coffee so early in the morning!! When you’re vacationing you want to sleep in and enjoy your love one!!! Blessings
10,Horrible property very unprofessional my problems barely were solved there could of been a lot more done for the problems the mirage dealt me. I will never stay nor will I recommend the mirage to any family or friends
10,Waited 2 hours for my room. The room was not clean. No fresh air in the room. It like living under a cheese bell. There’s was mold in the bat room 22029. Too expensive for what we get. Cigarette smoke in the casino.
40,Overall great stay. Rooms where above average on size. Bathroom a little small for a strip hotel. Mirage had a clean and fresh look. Not too big and not to small. Wife enjoyed the fresh flower smell each tone entering hotel.
50,Can't wait to come back in February. Had a blast.The staff is really friendly. Used the mobile check in and the young lady that check me in could not be nicer. I felt really welcome. I've stay in many hotel of the past 30 years but the Mirage is my favorite.
40,We liked staying at the Mirage. We were here in winter so pool was closed but overall this is a very comfortable resort to stay. The best thing about the resort is its location on the strip. You are walking distance to Cesears Harrahs the Linq treasure island and of course The Venetian right across the street! The restaurants in the Mirage are a little pricey but excellent food. This visit we discovered the cheesecake at the Deli and tried the steakhouse called Stack.  Both eateries are great! Again excellent food and service!  I must mention though our main reason for staying this visit was the great deal we got at the sports book!  $60 for all the alcohol you can drink  5 giant screens to watch football game comfy couches!!! Fantastic time was had by all!
10,Mirage first of all is a joke but a hotel. Everything was terrible starting with the front desk managers rude and mean..rooms dirty smelling bad and I couldn't open the window or something to get some fresh air in the room. Nothing is good about this...NOTHING! in the pictures its perfect but when u get there...OMG
10,Our Room smelt like mildew the bathroom being the worst part. The toilet is six inches off the ground so your knees are in your chest ....sportsbook and sportsbook bar service staff were insufferable.....will continue to avoid in the future.
10,Very outdated rooms smell like mold and mildew. Just a bad experience all around. Do not stay here. It’s in a convenient location for a work event or convention but if you’re on your personal dime don’t waste your money.
40,Great location to go anywhere in Strip. Most of the place is walking distance. Reception Staff was professional. New restaurant - Diablo - opened. Guest room is secured by monitoring card key by guardian.
40,We came here for a convention upgraded to a suite. Since we came on a Monday Check-In was a breeze even with asking about upgrading. We did have some confusion about which elevator to take front desk clerk stated we are on the 27th floor no elevator listed for that in the suites it seems that the letter before your room number is the reference to which floor to take such as ABC etc. the hotel has quite few dining options though can be a little high priced but of excellent quality. There is self parking as well as valet. Our bags were brought up to our room promptly once we let them know which room we were going to be in. The room we stayed in was B52. You walk in there a bar set-up to the right with a stocked mini bar do not lift packages or take anything out of fridge there are sensor so you will have a charge on your bill even if you place the item back. Walking straight ahead you come to the living room area with L shaped sofa desk and large screen TV. To the left of the living room there is a dining table with 4 chairs. Continue to the left and you are in the bedroom with a king bed that is firm (hard) and has pillow that are soft (flat) and fluffy looking. There is a TV in a console at the foot of the bed. Turning to the left you have arrived at the bathroom and arrive is the correct term it takes about 20 steps from the entrance of the suite. The bathroom is large with a shower jetted bathtub double sinks with a TV in one area turning to the left you walk into an area with a vanity on to the right of this is a walk in closet (small) and the water closet with toilet and bidet. Though there is a little wear in the room it seems clean. While there is bottled water available you will have to pay for it. There is no coffeemaker in the room there are two places that sells Starbucks coffee for that quick cup. There are no outlets to plug in any chargers but there are other places like the living room and bathroom that have outlets. There is an iron and ironing board hair dryer and the usual bath amenities. You could have the Pantry delivery food to the room.
50,Another fantastic stay at the Mirage Stayed in a new Wellness Room. Very clean. Air purifier in the room. Staff always friendly. Great lunch at Carnagie's.Property remains one of the best in Vegas. Still disappointed with some surcharges (Resort fee) when you do not use those services.
50,I was in Mirage with my family in New year. I had a good time here. Good location. It’s not too far from the hotel to airport or china town...the staff are friendly good service with clean room. Recommended . I will be back next year.
30,The experience was average. I like that my room was clean and there was enough storage space. I liked the soap in the bathroom. I enjoyed the tv channels that were available. The room temperature was a little difficult to adjust. The bathroom light kept needing to be reset via the wall outlet to work. The toilet stopped working for about an hour but was resolved in the last 30minutes. I did enjoy the location of my room as it faced the strip and I could watched the fire show.
30,We used to love the Mirage but it seems to be in a downhill slope. The rooms were really dated(orange shag pillows?Groovy baby) check-in took forever and the buffet was just sad. Even the best macaroons in the world couldn’t save it.
50,Excellent hotel with prime location and accommodating staff. This is our third year in a row to stay at Mirage as we find it to be a very clean hotel with the best location for shopping shoes and great dinner places.
50,Great job for the Mirage staff    Everything I experienced there was good sadly I did not get the try to Buffet as my coupon didn't work at the mlife desk  Due to the system being down.  But overall it was still a good experience
50,Mirage is a great place to stay. The front desk staff was great. Room was so spacious and clean! Bed was so comfortable. Lots to see and do there. Beatles Love Cirque show was good but Terry Fator was better. The dolphins was neat to see. The volcano eruption was awesome to watch. There are a lot of planes that fly over the hotel but they were not an issue at all.
20,"I just saw all the other reviews for this hotel and three stars seems appropriate. We stayed here for the CES convention and unfortunately I waited to long to book the hotel and this was one of the few places with availability when I finally booked a room.    When we arrived there was a huge line of people checking in. Not surprising given the convention but what was surprising was how few people there were to help people check in. They do offer a ""mobile"" check-in but I didn't want to download an app so we didn't use it. But after seeing the line and how slow it was moving I went to the email and selected the mobile check-in option. Surprisingly there was nothing I had to download and in less than a minute we were checked in. We went to the mobile check-in counter where there was no line showed the person the mobile check-in and that was it. The room wasn't ready but we were told we could leave our bags at the bellhop and they would text us when the room was ready which they did.    The room was nice when we finally got to the room. It was clean and fairly spacious. One thing we were surprised is there were no USB ports except at the desk to charge your phone. This was surprising to me since over the past few years every hotel I've stayed has at least a few ports by the bed. This way you can charge your phone and have your phone near you whereas if you charge at the desk during the night you won't have easy access to the phone.    The bathroom while clean seems very old. The shower curtain had a bad smell of mold and the shower head was leaking all around the edges. When looking at the walls there seemed to be quite a bit of rust or corrosion around the edges of the metal door frame and they just paint over it.    The beds... some of the worst! The mattress felt more like a box springs than a nice soft comfortable mattress. And the pillows are just plain foam in a pillow case. Absolutely terrible and didn't sleep very well.    Overall an old hotel and it shows. Simple little things like phone charging ports at the bedside would make a huge difference and it's shocking in this day and age they don't have those. The best thing I came away with after a stay here was a reminder to book my hotel as soon as possible so I don't get stuck in a place like this. Too many options in Vegas when it comes to hotels."
40,The hotel was entertaining. The restaurants were good or very good depending. The room service was promot during a very busy week. The front desk and concierge were very helpful. The pricing was high due to the event in town.
40,The Mirage is centrally located to many destinations. No fast food but there are restaurant options. Rooms are comfortable with a safe and seating. Check in was easy and staff were friendly. Slots were tight and many older machines need to be replaced. No non-smoking section in casino.
20,I stayed at this hotel for one night in January during CES. The room is fine the price is fair and the elevators work. The hotel is on the older side and it is due for an update. Especially the bathrooms. If it wasn't for the nasty mold growing all around the shower pan and the rude staff at checkout (check-in staff was wonderful) I would've rated his hotel much higher since it meets the needs. But I can't imagine showering here again which makes me feel like the hotel needs a real scrub down. With so many options on the strip why would I bother coming back?
30,The Mirage is perfectly located in the middle of the Las Vegas strip. The lobby for check in is spectacular with a large fish tank behind the front desk. The check in process is a bit long as there is a line to wait in that took about thirty minutes. In order to get to the elevator you have to walk to the middle of the casino which was a little inconvenient. I do like that they split the elevators up to about 5 floors each so you don’t wait a long time to get one. The rooms are large and moderately comfortable. The bed was a little hard for my taste but still comfortable enough to sleep in. The refrigerator was filled with stuff they want to sell you so it is unusable. The chairs and desk area are comfortable but well worn out. The bathroom is also easy to use but had a huge rust stain in the tub and the shower head looked like it had mold on it. Over all this is a nice hotel that just needs some tender loving care to make it a spectacular hotel.
50,Perfect location good places to eat easy access to the restaurants and gaming areas friendly staff. It's very convenient to get in and out of the hotel either self parking valet uber/Lyft or being picked up by private transportation. Mirage will always be my favorite Vegas destination
50,I enjoy the Mirage have stayed several times and if there was a problem it was immediatly taken care of. The Staff was very good The housekeeping department was excellent. The front desk did everything to help since I was travelling with a blind person
10,Currently staying at Mirage my room was supposed to be free and I just pay resorts fees and taxes. I checked in online and when I got to the hotel. I was charged multiple times for deposits. The hotel lady when told that it was the incorrect number on the screen. Told me that was the correct amount. By the time I left the counter my free room had cost almost $500. When I complained all she could do was give me $30 in food. I will never stay here again they swear it was reversed. I have yet to see that.
10,I’m here now for a family weekend reunion. After reading the reviews I did not want to stay here but our extended family had already made their reservations and picked The Mirage. I was hoping for the best but this place is in desperate need of a complete renovation. The whole casino stinks of smoke. The rooms are worn and dirty not to mention a strong smell of mold. The rugs are all pulled and worn. Furniture and bedding is scuffed and old. The bathroom is filthy. I have stayed at many hotels in Vegas and this one has to be the worst hotel I have ever stayed at anywhere. I can’t get out of here fast enough. Save your money and go elsewhere.
10,I play Popslots which is supposed to give you rewards for playing. Today I tried to redeem a buy one get one free coupon. I was told ( after purchasing the reward) that those rewars are blacked out until Monday. There was nothing on the website indicTing this....REALLY you Re going to alienate a customer over a drink. Poor customer service. Simve you are an MGM company. I will avoid tgem like the plague.
10,My room smelled strongly of mustiness and stale smoke. The A/C unit would turn off and every time I returned I got a headache.    The bathroom was not clean - I found hair covering the bath tub as well as ALL the walls in the bathroom. It was like the housekeeping staff did not even LOOK in the bathroom when they prepped my room.
20,Wanted to warn other travels that the hotel elevators to the rooms are through a very Smokey casino it’s Smokey all day long.    In 2020 it is unacceptable to me that a hotel  As vast as the mirage doesn’t see fit to cater to people who don’t want to breathe in other people’s smoke    I literally cannot breathe as I walk to and fro my room    Think the mirage management needs to understand this is not acceptable and needs to be clearly stated on their website
10,Had many issues and None were resolved! Have stayed at the Mirage over 15 times and will Never stay there again! Rude people at check in booked a strip view and the young girl was arguing with me that it was a up charge. I said fine and she said there are none available. It said on my reservation “Strip view” and she rudely said that “nobody looks at the notes?” Took 2 hours to get toilet paper delivered to room after we called twice to remind them. Had to call 3 times to get wash clothes because there were none in the room. Light in bathroom kept popping the circuit and no one came to fix from engineering. The final straw was woke up and stepped out of the bed and the floor was soaked. Called down 3 times and nobody came up to tell me why the floor is wet! Terrible customer service! MGM is in trouble if this is how they plan on taking care of there customers! We fly from Florida to Vegas two or three times a year to gamble and have fun and this trip was just not fun at The Mirage! It is sad because there was a time when the Mirage was 5 stars all the way!
20,"We chose the Mirage because people said it was the most family friendly hotel. However the pool areas were under construction our entire stay. (Which we were never told about) They don't have a coffee maker in the room. So your option in the mornings are to go stand in a long line at Starbucks or go to one of their pricey restaurants.The room provided to us was facing an ugly roof. Beware our room had 3 extra mini bar charges on it. My parents room also had a charge. I had to go dispute all of them. I was told if we checked out early there is an ""early"" checkout fee even though I prepaid for the room. The only saving grace for this hotel is that the dolphin show was good and the Beatles Love show. Both are pretty expensive if you're going with a large family or group of people. Next time I'll probably find a different hotel to bring the family to."
30,DH and I had a generally OK stay at the Mirage. We were in town really just to see the Love show (reviewed separately). We were on the 18th floor west wing 4 rooms away from the elevator equipment room. However as we went to sleep we could very clearly hear the elevator equipment clanging 24/7. During the day it was not really a problem but at night we slept with earplugs. For the short stay it was not worth trying to negotiate a room move.    We were promised a $75 food/beverage credit so I reviewed our folio which was emailed after we checked out carefully. I was frustrated to see that we were billed for an additional nights' stay! When I called to correct the error it took a full 25 minutes on the phone to get it straightened out. The note on our account was that we told a housekeeper we'd be staying an extra night?!?! We did receive a $50 credit for the trouble/error.
50,We and three other couples stayed at Mirage over New Years. It had been 14 years since we all got together in Vegas. All couples have been friends for 45 years. We selected the Mirage as we have stayed there many times and like the central location to things we like to do as well as rooms and service at the Mirage. We were not dissapointed as everyone enjoyed the casino many restaurants (especially the Still) sportsbook and the ladies the spa. The four rooms were very nice with only a slight problem in one with a rip in the fabric on headboard. New Years was great as went out on entrance driveway (closed for New Years) and could see fireworks from Treasure Island Venetian and Stratosphere. Fifth stay at the Mirage this year and have always enjoyed it. Nice variety of food options form casual to fancy. Easy walk to Caesers Forum Shops or accross street to Harrahs to catch monorail to South end of strip.
50,I stayed at the Mirage in Vegas for a Birthday Girls Trip. We had a 2 bedroom suite that had an amazing view! The suite was very nice with a jacuzzi tub see thru shower and bidet. The Mirage was very convenient restaurants downstairs casinos entertainment walking distance to the other casinos Linq Caesars Palace and Harrahs. I would definitely stay here again.
50,We had a room overlooking the volcano and absolutely loved our room! It was huge gorgeous and absolutely clean. Every person on the staff we spoke with was fabulous as well and we would absolutely recommend the Mirage - including going to see the dolphins!
40,We stayed as part of Christmas break with a 7 and 10 year old. The small pool was heated others in maintenance. Food in restaurants was tasty but expensive. For example $8 for a bowl 🍲 f oatmeal and $15 for pancakes. It was convenient but pricey. In fairness we were not their target customer as we don’t drink or gamble just wanted to do some fun things with the kids and visit the Hoover Dam Red Rock Canyon and other local sites. It is well situated on the strip within walking distance of the Bellagio fountains and we also caught Mystere at Treasure Island. There is a tram between Mirage and TI. The dolphin and white tigers were fun. FYI if they are having a seasonal special bring whatever is required. For example the website said draw a picture and get free admit. When we showed up we were told we should have brought one not done it there. The front desk took off the charge for the ticket so easy resolution but misleading web promo. The room was very clean and well kept excellent valet service(shout out to David) the restaurant staff pleasant and we made a point of tipping. We were well taken care of during our stay. One suggestion is to have a second coffee shop over by the elevators.
40,Best staff ever! We were treated like VIPs. Loved the Pantry restaurant. Loved our room. Location was awesome. The machines could be a little looser and the servers were hardly around but they have a good selection of games. The bar and video poker was our favorite.
50,This was my first trip to Vegas and can not be more pleased with my choice to stay at the Mirage. Thoroughly enjoyed our accommodations in a Stay well king room. Had a fantastic view of the volcano and the strip at night. Will definitely be back soon.
50,Beautiful resort with lots of options for dining & fun. We stayed 3 days in the Stay Well room & it was very comfortable. There was a $125 resort fee plus $100 a day charge that gets returned if the room is given back in the same condition SO at check in we were charged $425. Be prepared & do research before you go! The snacks are on display but kinda pricey so we didn't bother. The mini fridge is fully stocked with various items but don't remove unless you are prepared to purchase (it's sensored). This was my only complaint no fridge to keep personal items cold a microwave to heat up any items or coffee maker.
50,This was our first time at the Mirage but we will definitely stay there again. The location is perfect for us. The beds are very comfy and the rooms are nice and large. And the grounds are so tropical and kept her nice.
40,Was very busy with so much to do  Watched the eruption which is a must do it goes for about 5 minutes there was entertainment there on the pool water area outside which was fantastic to watch & was absolutely free 👍👍
50,Veer pleased with the entire experience. All of the staff were friendly and helpful. The facilities were first rate and everything worked very well. Checkout was also very easy. I found the rooms very quiet. The rooms were also very clean.
50,Great time will definitely refer friends. Can’t wait to go back soon. It’ll be nice if Mirage has free nights after going there many times. Gotta try your suites or penthouse. Thank you Mirage until next time.
50,"Enjoyable Memorable Sress free. The Mirage is like a hidden gem when it comes to finding a hotel/resort that matches what you are looking for. A place to come and unwind throughout the day and or night. I am already planning my next trip here in 2-3 months. Best staff and the food is the best. I was thinking I would see Chef Gordon Ramsey and his crew dining at the buffet. The menu especially the seafood was fantastic. If the staff would have said anything like ""are you sure we cannot get you to stay another day"" I probably would have taken the card out and stayed. Kudos to everyone at the Mirage. Greatness is truly out there indeed>"
50,"Simply put the Mirage Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas will continue to be one of my top 3 hotels in Las Vegas. I had the opportunity to experience more of the ""business"" side of the hotel on this trip and everything was great. The rooms the suites everything was top shelf. While the Mirage does not bill itself as one of the ""high end"" properties it really is a hidden gem when it comes to quality."
30,Decent casino but overall just an average at best place to stay. Rooms are old and musty. The check in was not a good start considering they didn't have the room we reserved. Nothing horrible or bad and nothing good about it.
40,Vegas Trip and stay at the Mirage. Enjoyed the experience and the staff. This was my first time staying at the Mirage and would like to stay at this location again. My room did smell like someone that stayed prior to me was smoking.
20,The hotel staff & servers on the floor have worse beside manner than a physician. They all look like they hate their jobs and could care less about helping you. Janitors were friendly but rooms were over all not very clean - wouldn’t bathe in the tub & don’t get to close to those blinds.  Never stayed here before though so thought we should try it this time - most likely won’t be back.  Also who only has the pool open from 10am-4pm?!
20,I’ve stayed at the Mirage a couple times before this one and the other times had been pleasant but this third time was very disappointing and unpleasant. The smell in the non-smoking (stay calm) room was horrendous. It smelled of urine mold mildew musty and cigarette smoke. We asked to be moved and they stated we could not move until the next day. When we were moved to the second room on the same floor the smell was the same. The stay calm section needs to be renovated immediately. I doubt I stay at the mirage again.
50,The trip here for the Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity Inc National Founders Day Conference was exceptional. This hotel met the expectations of our members and guest. We are pleased for what Las Vegas have to offer
10,It took 40 minutes to check in with Mobile Check in. Was given a dirty room. Called the front desk about the room and was on hold for over 20 minutes. So came back down with luggage. I was promised $20 food credit which I did not receive. Charged $20 to do mobile check in and out. Resort fees. Ripoff. Every restaurant was over-priced including Star Bucks.
40,Nice place friendly staff need non smoking casino the smoke in evenings will about kill you. If your not a smoker you’ll smell like you are! Other that that didn’t see many winners gamble responsibly.
40,Perfect location on the strip! The rooms were clean and comfortable and the service was friendly. Walking distance to quite a bit as well!    The casino has everything one would need but did not have a lot of lower dollar tables. Plenty of bar and restaurant choices as well.
40,We chose the Mirage for the total Las Vegas Boulevard experience and were not disappointed. The Mirage was in constant motion and the Hotel and Casino did a good job keeping pace with the happenings surrounding the New Years Eve festivities.
40,Stayed for just one night beginning of December. Enjoyed my stay but begrudge paying $16 for a large bottle of water. I know there’s a mark up for using the mini bar but $16!!! Otherwise enjoyed my stay
20,Our room was in disrepair and outdated. The drawer to the nightstand would not close and I hurt my shin on it. The tile in the shower did not have grout around it it was moldy. The bartender at the center bar was rude and acted as if we were bothering him and we sat down for a drink. Catch the deli restaurant in the hotel required us to tip before sitting down - at a table that wasn’t even wiped down. And the server was also rude to us.
10,I have stayed at many hotels there but none worse than this. The thermostat was broken and it was ridiculously hot throughout my stay. If you enjoy sweating in your sleep for no reason come stay here.    I complained and nothing was done. While at the desk other gusts came complaining about the same thing. An obviously known problem ignored.    Then while cleaning my room I came back to it and the maid gingerly walks out and says “ I take money on table”. My wife had left some money there by accident and the maid felt entitled to let me know she felt obligated to take it.    I complained and got my resort fee refunded. Well maybe as I have yet to see it.    I saw a Lady Gaga whose concert was air conditioned unlike my room and she stole my heart much like their housekeeping staff.
50,We go to Vegas 5 times a year. We always stay at the Mirage. We love the service rooms and attention you get at the Mirage we have a host that takes care of us on every trip. The food is amazing. Carnegie Deli you need to split a sandwich.
10,The room was horribly smoky and when we asked to move they downgraded our room and gave no compensation whatsoever. I won’t be staying here again.    There are way better alternatives that I’ve had much better experiences for about the same price.
40,We had just checked in so we were hungry! We went to the buffet and it was nasty! The food was lukewarm at bestbut mostly cold. The health inspector should make a stop because someone is going to get sick! However the rest of the trip went better because the only place we would eat was the California Pizza Kitchen. We had a lot of fun playing the Free Bet Black Jack tables and came home with more than we left with!
50,Great time had a great New Year.and a wonderful .Anniversary Thanks to a Great Host David Pitegoff Thank you sir for everything people if you want a good time I advise you when your in Las Vegas stay at the mirage well worth it
50,We selected the Mirage because it was a pet friendly hotel. I have not stayed here in 5 years or so. The rooms seemed to be remodeled and were excellent. The food options are plentiful. Casino layout is nice and not too big. VIP check in was so convenient and relaxing. Right mix of new and old slots. Casino is the right size for me. The pet relief area is the best I have ever seen. Plenty of space next to the taxi area que area in front of hotel. My pet was treated very well by staff. I thank them for the hospitality. I do agree the elevator can be frustrating if your magnetic strip is not working on your hotel key card. The location is convenient to several casinos restaurants and bars. Plenty to do around the hotel. I recommend this hotel.
40,We have been here several times over the years. We love the Mirage but it is a sweet lady that is aging. The carpet and fixtures in the rooms are getting worn. Our room had a musty smell. The location is fantastic. The restaurants are diverse and good. The staff that we dealt with were fantastic. Check in was smooth.
50,Awesome we had a blasting new year eve celebration. Safety and security was great Didn't feel any confusion or any other safety issue. The only problem we had was the parking issue which was taking over 15-25 minute to exit from parking.
50,The live entertainment (Jay Leno) food (Diablo) rooms (King size and comfortable) and spa (Sauna Hot Tub and Steam Room) were the best and we can't wait to return. Our New Year's experience was unforgettable. Thank you.
30,although there were things that I wasn't happy with It was the perfect place for the New Years Festivities  I've been to vegas so many times and will return again in the future however with having to pay extra to have a decent style/size bathroom and over charging M-Life guest for parking - the Mirage will not be my next choice to stay at
50,The staff the cleanliness the family friendly hotel is a 1st choice from now on. Very central located as well. Stayed 4 days 3 nights and worth every minute. Even on the busiest event day - New Years Eve-getting a cab out front was easy and organized b/c staff is positioned there at all times. Good security too.
50,This hotel is in an excellent location on the strip with a beautiful pool area lovely rooms plenty of food options. I have stayed in The Venitian MGM Grand and Mirage and The Mirage is my favouite. I have booked to go to Vegas again in October 2020 with 3 of my girl friends for my birthday and have booked The Mirage for this special occasion. The staff are all lovely and I am really really looking forward to my next visit. Thank you Mirage x
20,Sadly the Mirage Hotel and Casino has gotten too old and needs a major face lift with poor quality of food for the price. Has very limited number of gaming tables. The hotel is smelly and dirty and far less desirable than competing hotels for the price.
30,Stayed here for a conference room prices were reasonable but eating in any of the Casino restaurants was pricey for the content. The buffet food selection was limited and most food was overcooked or bland. Breakfast restaurant was $60+ for two simple breakfasts. $29 for bottled water in the room! Thankfully across the street was a Walgreens with regular Pricing and a Denny's for breakfast. We found regular prices at the Cheesecake factory in Ceasar's Palace. Heard from a local cab driver that gambling is down so many Casino's are trying to recoupe the losses with services hoping people won't notice the price until they get sticker shock on check-out!
40,We booked last minute and found a great rate. Check in was a breeze and knowing now that I can check in via mobile app next time will be even quicker. Everything was still decorated for the holidays when we got there and on the 31st when we left the New Year’s eve celebrations and decorations had begun. The hotel was clean and the employees were all friendly! The bed was comfortable and the room had a great fully stocked mini bar although completely overpriced.    Don’t forget to go and see the dolphins and Secret Garden.
40,The location is its best plus in the strip close to everything from dining entertainment shopping and things to do.  Great stay with a few issues: The check-in process was too slow 1 hour to get in after 2/ 4hrs flights is exhausting. Nice lobby but the casino smells too much to cigarrettes. Would appreciate a coffee maker in room or hot coffee and chocolate in vending machines.  The room was comfortable and quiet.
40,We've been to Vegas several times but this was our first time to stay at The Mirage. The location couldn't be much better it is right in the middle of the strip adjacent to other casinos like Harrah's Caesar's Treasure Island and Casino Royale. Our room was clean and spacious and the front desk & housekeeping were all very friendly. One issue we had with our room was that the air conditioning was operated on a motion detector which meant that every time we came back to our room it was very warm. The wi-fi was quite slow as well.    We were there between Christmas & New Years and the hotel was FULL of kids running around. So if you are looking to take a break from kids on your vacation this is probably not the place for you.
30,Stayed here for a few nights. The room wasn’t anything special but a typical 4 star compared to the fancier hotels in Vegas I have stayed at. I recommend you book directly with the hotel to check in easily online there was a long line up otherwise. The casino didn’t have much slots that I was interested in I went to other casinos. I think the best part of this hotel was the location. I wouldn’t necessarily stay here again just because I like other hotels on the strip better.
10,My husband and I arrived at the hotel on December 25 2019. We met several situations in the hotel. First the room cleaning service was not efficient. we had to request that they clean. Second we check the account daily on television and find charges for the mini bar although we do not consume. Third to make claims we had to make long lines as guests just arriving. There is no line for registered guests. Last on New Year's Eve they knocked on the door loudly the hotel person insisted that the door be opened even though my husband was telling me to wait a moment to get dressed. The hotel person opened the door with the sign of not disturbing but we had the door lock and insisted on pushing it. When my husband opened the door I looked into the room saying it was for security. He was accompanied by a security guard. Then he went down the stairs adjacent to the room. At no time do I knock on other doors. In those moments I felt fear for our lives for the attitude of the hotel person. In addition to feeling discriminated against by our race and origin. I do not recommend this hotel. I'm still shocked by the situation.
20,Plan on about an hour waiting in line just to check into your room. Movies ordered wouldn't plan. Don't eat at the Diablo restaurant. Overpriced and poor service. This was our 1st trip and we will never stay here again.
40,I had a fantastic stay here. The room was great and I was even given a corner suite! The room was spacious but the bathroom was nothing special. I did a mobile check in for my first time as well. I might stay again on a MyVegas comp.
40,Checking in in Christmas Eve was a nightmare we queued for 45 minutes and it was so slow. Only four people on front desk with 50+ in queue. Just unacceptable really. Our room was on 19th floor with mountain views. We were pleasantly surprised with room but bathroom was very small and lots of rust damage from leaking tap. It’s definitely time for some maintenance! We loved the location the bed and comfortable pillows the drawer space and the casino area so lots of positives too.    Would we stay again? Maybe if the price was right but the queue at check in did put us off.
40,Me and my wife stayed here for a wk over the Christmas period.Our budget doesn’t stretch to hotels like the bellagio but we also like somewhere better than hotels like Excalibur or Luxor so Mirage was perfectlocation is excellentgot some good places to eat and two starbucks to keep you going.On arrival there was a huge que for chk in but they got through it quicklywe were given an excellent room over looking the strip and volcano. Casino is good with plenty of cocktail waitresses.The Mirage has an excellent area to grab your Uber there’s plenty of room and where it’s positioned gives easy access to major roads. There’s a few negative reviews about the rooms looking tired but ours was finebig and clean. I would definitely recommend the Mirage.
10,"We have stayed here many times and usually have no real issues but this time was incredibly frustrating. Our key cards would almost never work in the elevators so it was always a hassle to try to get out before someone else gets in and pushes their floor and you take a ride to nowhere and then hop into a different elevator hoping your key will actually work in this one before you end up taking another ride to nowhere unless they happen to be going to your floor then you just hope your card will open your room door. Then you have to get new cards and endure the speech about how we are somehow de-magnetizing our cards yes I get it I know how that can happen when its too close to cellphones magnet closures yada yada. I travel a lot I stay in lots of hotels and they all use key cards and I have never had an issue this bad anywhere even here in the past but this trip was my last at Mirage because of it. It absolutely drove me insane and during my rides to nowhere I chatted with people who were having the same issues one guy had about 4 key cards and he has one that works in the elevator but not his room one that works for the room but not the elevator and 2 backups for when those stop working that he keeps separate from the others just in case. Such a mess and it wasnt limited to the rooms and elevators I found that my players card only worked aboout 50% of the time. I'd sit on a machine put money in and then keep getting the ""invaid re-insert invalid re-insert"" omg! cash out go to the next one and hope it works and do this process over and over sometimes just not even bothering to change machines i'll just play with no card in over it! This was after I got a replacement players card too because I thought it was my card. It just seems like some serious updated is needed to card readers here. I truly dont believe key cards are the issue it seems like the elevators room doors and slot machines need reader updates badly. My advice would be to request no less than 4 cards when you check in to increase your odds of one working. My stay was pure madness just trying to get to my room let alone get in the door every day multiple times a day."
10,For an upscale hotel this is not. I have had better rooms and meals at a holiday inn than the Mirage. For the price you pay you should get the room and service to match. Our room was nasty but by the time you find out everything the hassle to change rooms is more problematic than just the few nights you will be there. The buffet was horrible. There were no choices people were walking up to get food and they were out at 6 pm and the place was empty. Should have been a clue. The pop machines didn’t work and when I went to get orange juice it came out a water mix. Then what food there was had no taste it reminded me of Vegas Vacation when they go to the $1 buffet and get the blue food and he asks if it’s beef or chicken. Also why a resort fee? The pools were all closed you have to pay for parking there is no special line for the restaurants or even discounts. You walk into the hotel and all the doors say WiFi and there is not a password for it so why pay for that? We will never stay again.
30,The casino and restaurants were quite nice and the location was good. The room was outdated and the bathroom was tiny and we could hear our neighbors VERY clearly. Water pressure was good. Average hotel.
20,The hotel itself isn't bad the facility is nice looking the rooms are spartan but serve their purpose nothing luxurious about them though. They do charge a $37/day resort fee but I cant say I saw anything that really justifies it. The wifi is spotty (one of the things the resort fee supposedly goes toward). I had towels in my room that looked more like garage rags holes in them fraying. I did find the beds rather comfortable which was a good thing since I spent an entire day in it recovering from food poisoning I got from their $37.50/person buffet which had food on the same level of quality as most roller grills in gas stations I guess the food poisoning shouldn't have been a shock. They have a refrigerator in the room that you can't use it's only so staff can restock the mini bar I guess so should you have any leftovers from your dinner you can't safely store them and will have to throw them away. Ironically they have a sign in the bathroom about trying to go green by not having to wash towels too often yet force you to throw away any leftover food you may have. If you have any dining restrictions you are going to struggle to find food here. Me and my girlfriend are vegan and she has Celiac's disease and it was very difficult to find food to eat even the Japanese restaurant (Asian food usually has good options for us) didn't offer tofu as a substitute for meat in their dishes. All in all I really felt like this place only exists to try to squeeze every last cent out of it's guests while providing the least in return.
30,I have stayed at the Mirage often and on for years.  I remember when it use to be one of the best hotels on the strip. Now it is far outshined by the Wynn Venetian Aria Bellagio and many others.    Specific problems my group encountered on this trip included water coming through a ceiling light into a tub in one bathroom hair in the tub in another bathroom before we used it a far smokier casino than the newer casinos we visited and much louder music blaring than any other hotel/ casino we visited. In fact it was so unpleasant we wound up doing most of our gambling at other hotels.    The M Life staff at the Mirage is also less accommodating than at the Aria and Bellagio.  Lastly the buffet has seriously deteriorated over the years. In fact all M Life buffets are now inferior to the Wynn’s Venetians Caesars and the Cosmopolitan although Aria’s is not bad.    On the positive side the Mirage rooms are still spacious and well furnished and the location cannot  be beat. Also Carnegie deli and the coffee shop are nice reasonably priced restaurants with good food.  The Italian restaurant is overpriced and cannot compete with the nice restaurants at the Venetian.    Overall the Mirage is not bad but it sure is not the hotel and casino it used to be.
50,Accomidations were wonderful and clean. Had a great view of the northern looking boulevard. Spacious bathroom in the Tower section of the hotel with double sinks. The shower could have been larger. Ideal location along Strip centrally located with nearby shopping at Forum shoppes nearby various high end and modest restaurants access to multiple shows for entertainment etc.. I have stayed here multiple times and will gladly stay here again. Comparatively favorable rates. The pool area is awesome!
10,Horrible room the bathtub don't work. my wife would like to use the bathtub at night. Overall it was not a great place to stay. The sports book was really friendly overall. The room is a little dirty in the bathroom.
20,Previous experinces have been good.    Check-in : The room we had booked was given away!! ….... so we had to have a double queen room. Smaller bed then what we have at home. Going on a nice vacation and having to sleep in a smaller bed then we have at home is silly.    Guest room : The safe was locked on the first day and we had to ask security and open it for us  so that we could use it . Out of the 4 nights at the hotel we only got our room serviced once... we had to specially request it done that one time as well... if we did not ask it might not have been done at all !!!! The first night we arrived the room was fine and then the next day we got no maid service..... So lucky we had extra towels and the next day I called to make sure we got housekeeping that day which we did after we called. Then the following day after that we got no house keeping again! On our departure day we needed to share the one clean towel we had left in the room after our showers . We also left a decent tip and on the one day we did get house keeping. .. but they still never came back.    Staff Friendliness: While gambling at the sports bar video poker tops we found the new staff their quite rude. The rude staff was the first time we have had bad experience at this location. We loved KURT but these other guys were just stand offish and reason we gambled more at other places this time. I think they are new.. I haven't seen them before. We decided to mostly gamble video poker at other property locations bars after that. ( Everyone else we had interactions with was great )    Dining: Ate at Carnegies which we LOVE great food great price great people. The Diablos was also very good.
40,A fabulous smaller resort (except for the door and the limited gym hours). Good buffet fun casino great location on the Strip easy to get in and out of the hotel room (fast and easy). The only problem is that there is no foyer so you will hear absolutely everything going on outside the corridor (the door needs to be soundproofed); the other problem is that the gym has very limited hours.
30,Overall the hotel was just ok. Check-in was a nightmare. Mobile checkin took over a half hour. I miss the kiosks where I can just scan my code and get my key. Casino host won't waive resort fees for medium-roller play. Quite uncooperative even though no one was in line. Acted like he didn't have the time to speak with me.
50,Everything is right on the property for a total Vegas experience. Great dining  shopping entertainment Casino. Friendly staff. No need to leave but if you do it is centrally located for easy traveling to other properties.
40,Overall experience has been good. Hotel is centrally located on the strip ease of going to various locations exceptional. Front desk check in went generally smooth provided tips and good information. Room cleaning crew did a pretty good job as well.
20,Booked a Strip view room with early check in on Christmas day received neither They said they would waive 2 days resort fees but that didn't cover my upcharge Will have second thoughts about staying here
30,"Resort Two Queen room using a rewards credit for a free night.    The room was a nice size and the beds comfortable. Staff was friendly and always had a ""hello"".    There is no view to speak of. I know I didn't pay extra for it but it sure feels like I did. As the strip gets newer and sleeker hotels and the Mirage is getting lost in these behemoths.    The bathroom was a big disappointment. Chucks of marble were missing and it looks like the bathtub faucet had recently been replaced and poorly spackled back in. You also couldn't adjust the shower head.    The Pantry restaurant gets a line early but the buffet was fine.    The guards that ask to see your room key when going to elevators need some lessons in manners. Oh did I say ""ask""? Uh pretty much demanded it. I saw them act rudely to some guests.    Also sorry I don't get it. But mini-bar in the room with snacks but no coffee service? Ugh.    Some of the lobby bars and restaurants seemed to close kind of early (sports bar was open late but bad views of TV's). I could be wrong about closing early but we really didn't eat at the hotel - except for the Carnegie deal (average also) and the Buffet (average as well).    It's not that inconvenient. Right across from the shops at the Venetian and next door to shops at Caesars. A little less than 20 minutes to walk from the side exit to the fountains at the Bellagio.    In the end it was just fine. Maybe a little pricey for what I got. I think there are swankier choices in Vegas which I'm sure come with a commensurate price tag. But if you're not looking for frills then this is an OK place to stay."
20,This was the first time at the Mirage we were put on a floor where there were families with noisy children and someone in a suite with a barking dog obviously unattended. There should be floors for adults only. People with dogs should have more courtesy not to leave them in their room to continuously bark. They need adult only floors/
30,Celebrating Christmas in The Mirage Hotel and Casino Las Vegas Nevada U.S. The good and friendly service personal in the hotel very clean Mirage Casino very good restaurants and coffee shops but Rooms Furniture and accessory very old and torn.
40,We stayed at Mirage December 23-28 and I must say it was a great experience! It had been awhile since we stayed there. Our King room was located on the 17th floor with a semi view of the strip. Room was very clean bed was comfortable and housekeeping did not disappoint.  We ate at Carnegie Deli (huge Hot Pastrami sandwiches) The Still (Lobster tacos and Korean chicken wings) & The Pantry (Eggs Benedict) all very good and located right at hotel.  Its an older hotel but its clean and comfortable the staff was very professional and helpful in every way.  We reccomend this hotel and will definitely return..
40,Our stay was nice but the food and drink prices are outrageous. They should have more affordable food items especially while your in the sports book. Try feeding a family of 4 here. The buffets would be about $150 for our family.
10,We've been waiting in the line for an hour they have only 2 people checking in!!! Really??? And the line has about 50 more people waiting. I have a toddler and 2 seniors with me. Terribl3 customerservice.
30,Mirage is falling behind and needs to update. Shower needs water pressure and a better shower head burned out lightbulbs and just feeling tired. There were problems with the elevators. I have stayed here several times before but this time I really felt they are falling behind. They now have security at the elevators but only later at night.
40,The Mirage has always been one of my favorite hotels to visit on the strip. This was my first time staying here. Everything was great! We got to check in early which was great. Our room was on one of the top floors so we had a great view of the strip. The only downfall was the room was starting to look a little tired and could use a refresh. other than that though the Mirage was an amazing stay!
50,Service was great! I lost my key and lost and found department find them and send it to me. Thank you and Happy New Year! You are the best ! Thank you for the great time and beautiful service! I recommend to stay in Mirage Hotel and Casino!
40,When we arrived at the Mirage I was surprised to have to pay another $500+ in resort fees; I had not anticipated such charges. This was for two rooms. It was nice that the Mirage did adjoin the rooms as we requested.
40,the shower at the hotel was not good at all. I had some problems with it. also the room was not what I wanted the view wasn't good even after we asked for a nice view. however the location of the hotel was good. It was close to the main street.
40,Mirage has good shows that were available during the pre-Christmas week. MLife has some offers for shows but comped rooms don't cover the resort fee. Very convenient location on the strip to walk and visit other properties.
40,The pool area is CLOSED FOR REMODELING. And this was not disclosed upon booking on their website. We chose the Mirage entirely because of having the best pool area (stayed before) we don’t drink or gamble. We chose to have a good time despite not being able to relax at the pool but it cost us ALOT more money to do things because we couldn’t spend the afternoons there as planned. The hotel is nice but it’s not ok that they do not disclose this info. Staff was exceptional and the location is great.
20,No to Mirage for sure. Reason- you book the hotel not just for location but for other amenities and Mirage fails to provide even the basic one like water bottles Coffee maker and do not even think about any microwave. Further the restaurants say no to heat-up any food you have. Now you need to shell money every morning for coffee/tea. Have to eat outside-no option to use microwave simple foods like oats in room because you can't eat outside food daily.  I got to know from a friend about another hotel which provides all the basic things plus microwave and then i paid almost 150dollars as compared to his 30dollars. So it feels like cheated.  Also now I learned one thing here that hotel can be anywhere on strip because at the end you have to walk from one place to another to see the beauty of strip.
50,The Casino have good and helpful dealers spacing in between tables & machines and crowd of people are welcoming not uptight. The hotel location is amazing if you like to go to China town and across to try their local restaurants
10,Currently staying at the Mirage with my family of four. I’ve always wanted to stay here because I loved the location. But...that’s the only positive I can see. The rooms are seriously in need of an update as is the lobby. Our room was not clean (gross carpet and outdated decor) and the window has a 1/8 inch air gap letting air and noise in. Plus we got stuck for 15 minutes in a stairway exit that locks! Has to be better places out there!
50,Very kept up. Clean bathrooms even smelled clean at all times. Clean rooms good beds over awesome. Will for sure come back but i would like to try other places too. But very clean and up to date. Desk people were a lot of help and food was better than exspect Ed. No soggy eggs
50,Great travel experience.  Great facility staff and environment. My family and I have always been treated like family. That’s what is Great about MGM and other casinos. The front desk corrected a travel checkin and cost mistake. Casino staff were great and helper even if are not a high roller or professional gamer.
50,We love staying at the Mirage. When you first enter the Hotel Casino take a deep breath. Casinos pump in smells and this one is my favorite. The hotel staff is very friendly and welcoming. The rooms are comfortable and well laid out.  We have stayed here six times and have always had a positive experience.  The show choices are always fun. We really like the Still as an option for snacks and drinks. Don’t miss the volcano each evening. There a number of good viewing locations but I really like directly in front of the entrance.
40,Overall the hotel and room was in very good condition. The location was very handy for us. The room attendant had missed a few items over the 3 days but housekeeping quickly replaced them when we called. Overall it was a relaxing stay.
50,Customer service was great loved the housekeeping’s attention to our room check-in mobile experience was great. Loved the volcano every night. Will be back here. If you are not sure I’m telling you it’s worth it. It is walking distance to almost everything.
50,Great value at this hotel. Central. Updating of hotel was nice. Cravings buffet is a great deal. We had a lot of luck with their slots and table games. Didn’t like the $15 charge for self park! Also be careful of the snacks in room which are weighted. Don’t touch them unless you’re willing to pay.
40,My wife and I stayed a week at the Mirage while visiting family who were also staying there. The rooms were beautiful and the only problem we encountered was that the USB outlets did not function. We had a nice view of the mountains but if we returned for an extended stay we’d request a room that didn’t face the Trump hotel. Beds were comfortable. On our second to last night there was a loud banging noise coming from the bathroom plumbing at 3 am that woke us but it stopped after half an hour.  The casino isn’t especially smoky which was awesome and the fact that almost every other song played was by the Beatles was an added bonus. We would return!
50,We stayed in the 1 bedroom tower suite. The room was large & beautiful with fantastic views. The room had a spacious living room dining room & bar area. We were meeting a large group of friends out there so this room was perfect for entertaining. People could talk and not have to scream over a noisy bar or restaurant. The only complaint was with the spa tub. At certain times of the day there was no hot water but at other times it was fine. The other thing I felt was odd was there was no guest bathroom. With all that entertaining space there was only the master bath. It didn’t bother us but it might some people. Would definitely stay there again.
30,Just a place to hang out if you need a shower or toilet. Or perhaps a cat nap. Other than that the staff is nice. It seems you have to spend more than what you expect to get something nice. If anything staying at a motel 6 or somewhere cheaper to save you some cash would be best.
10,My wife and I stayed at the Mirage for 3 nights. We have visited Vegas many times. Every night we were kept awake by rowdy guests 2-3 rooms away. Their doors were open yelling music blasting all night. I’m all about having fun in Vegas but not in the rooms from 1-6am! Mirage management did nothing to help. Then to top it all off - $18 for a bottle of water in the room! EIGHTEEN DOLLARS. We had one bottle a day. Albeit my mistake for not checking the price but I assumed $5-6 which I was willing to pay. But $18? Will not return or stay at the Mirage again. And will pass this feedback along to anyone who asks.
40,The room is in a good size we enjoyed the amazing pool there is plenty of sun bed available at the pool there is a shopping area at the ground floor there also a lot of parking lot available (with fee).
50,I always think of Vegas Vacation when I stay because it was filmed here! My favorite movie to get me into the mood to visit Las Vegas! I live here now but still like to staycation on the Strip occasionally. The casino is great and the rooms are newly renovated. I just stayed in a standard room but it was very comfortable and felt high class. Saw Beatles LOVE show and it was so fun! Great restaurants as well. All around perfect place to stay in Vegas!
30,Overall experience is ok; Casino area needs upgrades  restaurants Needs improvement Starbucks charge us for some hot water $50/ day if use the refrigerator in the room ( not expectable) otherwise we had a good time in Vegas
20,We reported mold in the shower after our first night and switched rooms only to find mold in the second and third rooms. Room smelled like must/mold and my girlfriend started feeling sick while in the room. Will not stay again.
50,Me and my family had a great weekend at the Mirage hotel saw a lot of shows and had great dinner with friends. I will decently recommend the hotel with friendly staff and clean rooms. Super duper trip!
40,Did the casino visit as day guests. Early dinner at the buffet. Thoroughly enjoyed the shrimp and crab claws. No win at the casino slots—bummer. Buffet price was high (nearly $40 per person) inc non-alcoholic beverages. Extra cost for all you can drink alcohol options. Great option for high rollers!
50,We were here on a complimentary stay from the Mirage. We spent only 2 nights due to the weather... rare early snowfall. Our room faced the strip and the lights at night were Fantastic! Yes we had black-out drapes. Ours was a handicap suite. It had wide doors and a very large roll in bathroom. The shower was only large enough for one of us at a time... not a problem though. The decor is beautiful. We arrived late so after spending a few hours in the casino we fell asleep by 9! That happens at home. We awoke at 2am and discover that the casino was the place to be. The machines are Very loose at 3am! We walked across the street to Denny's for Breakfast and had all the rest of our meals in the Buffet at the Mirage. It was a Wonderful break from our stressful California lives.
40,Rooms are big and set up nicely. Room Service was tasty. Nice big flat screen. Comfy bed. We had a fantastic view of the volcano from our room. Toilet is in the bathroom Id prefer it to be separate. Black out curtains are lacking and rooms were somewhat loud.
50,Great experience at Mirage - King Tower Suite. Normal rooms are okay but suites are really great to live. Location is really great. Great food options inside or across the road. Nice Volcano show view from the rooms
50,We wanted to get away for a few days to Vegas & decided to stay here. North end of strip is located close to Fashion Show Mall & not too big so your not walking for 10 minutes to your room. Parking is available off the strip so avoiding traffic is easy access to garage.
30,Overall I was happy with my stay. The hotel has a good location and staff was friendly. The bathroom shower curtain had some nasty stains on it though which was something that should have been fixed a long time ago. Makes a very bad impression when you step into the shower!
40,We had a great stay at The Mirage. The room was nice and the bed was very comfortable. We gambled here but really didnt do well in that regard. Enjoyed walking the strip from here. We ate at a mexican place in the hotel next door and it was terrible!!!
20,Not what we were expecting. More of a stage show Choreography than anything else.  Some good performers but no real storyline and NO dancing by performers that remotely captured that of MJ.  We were seated near the stage and we overcome by the fake smoke.
40,We stayed here as it was close to a concert we were going to see at Caesar's and hosted the second show we were to attend. I had stayed here about 25 years ago and remembered it to be a nice place to unwind. Well the prices have gone up (a lot!) but the Mirage is still in terrific shape. The 16th floor room was spacious and accommodating.The beds were firm and the pillows soft. You'll definitely get your walking in staying here - our room was at the end of a hallway whose length was reminiscent of the Overlook Hotel in Stephen King's The Shining! ;-) You'll be across the street from Harrah's and The LINQ There is a walkway that leads to the High Roller that hosts a bunch of restaurants and eateries next to The LINQ. The staff was friendly and not intrusive. We'll be back the next time we head to LV to deposit some money in the casinos.
50,I was kind of hesitant to stay at the mirage because it’s priced on the “higher” side but it was a great time! The rooms were very clean well maintained! The staff at the hotel is some of the friendliest I ever meet. Ashleigh at the front desk was super friendly gave me a room upgrade and a couple tickets to the Garden/dolphin habitat! The casino is very nice not super big either very easy to navigate compared to other hotels/casino. The buffet was very good breakfast lunch and dinner. They have many shops and places to eat at the Mirage. The Volcano show is awesome I think it’s the best free show in Vegas definitely check it out! The location on the strip is the best it’s centrally located. The pool was closed but it’s middle of December so that’s fine. If you have kids or wanna do some fun stuff check out the Secret Garden/Dolphin habitat! I definitely recommend staying at The Mirage! I would stay again if I come back to a Vegas!
50,We LOVED staying at The Mirage. The rooms were ok...VERY CLEAN but SMALL bathrooms. Could use some updating. The entire staff at The Mirage were SO NICE and friendly from the time we checked in until we departed. Absolutely one of our best stays in Vegas. The Casino could pay better but it was spotless. The restaurants were affordable unlike some other places we have stayed and the food was good. LOVED the buffet and ate there twice for breakfast. We just had a GREAT TIME. It truly was relaxing. We WILL be back!!!
50,Was convenient to everything we like to do and casino's we normally frequent. Good walking distance to everything. We had tickets to Reba at Ceasers right next door. Biggest complaint for me was food selection. Needs some healthier choices.
30,I have visited Las Vegas several times and have always wanted to stay at the Mirage. I booked it for an anniversary trip. Staff was very nice at check in and we were in our room quickly. Upon inspection of the room there were numerous hairs in the tub and when I say numerous it was everywhere. The walls were even covered in these black hairs😳. The sheets did appear clean but the room had an odd smell to it. I called for house keeping to clean the bathroom and someone did come while we were out but still wonder what their standards are cause no one could of not seen that. The machines in the casino are horrible go across the street to the little Casino Royale its much better. We ate at the buffet and it was one of the worst we have ever had in Vegas. We did eat breakfast in the hotel and that was much better. I was just completely underwhelmed with staying here. Parts of it are beautiful inside but coming in from parking garage you have to pass the nightclub and there were people outside of it laying on the ground security everywhere and the ghetto music does not make a good impression.
50,Nice clean hotel. Rooms and restroom were clean. Beds were comfortable. Mini bar in the room was stocked. Room service available. Nice casino with restaurants and bars. Walking distance to Fashion Show Mall and other attractions. Friendly staff. Hotel is located on the strip. Enjoyed our stay. Got 30 dollars off per day coupon for food. Easy check in and out. Staff took care of us. Will stay here again. Thank you Mirage for your hospitality.
50,Ive been staying at the Mirage for over 15 years.  Many things make this an outstanding resort - below is just a few.  Rooms are always very clean and smoke free  Poker Staff are some of the best on the strip  As a Platinum Mlife member - im treated very respectful and professional  Everytime Ive had a challenge within the resort - the problem was resolved very fast and communicated  Food Selection - outstanding  SportBook - nice and large
30,No in room coffee pot fridge etc. restaurants too crowded. Vegas hotels pure greed; making tons of money taking more from hotel guests. Poor signage for navigation of casino floor and finding restaurants
40,I usually stay at Aria or Park but I got a great deal this time at Mirage so gave it a try. It had been a while since I stayed at the Mirage. There has been some updating of the property and that was nice. Everyone we encountered on the staff was great. Room was comfortable. Bathroom tub and shower showed some wear and food options felt limited although it is close to Venetian and Palazzo which have a lot of options. Those were the primary reasons for a 4 instead of a 5.
50,The Mirage is a great hotel/casino with endless amenities. I love the central strip location and easy highway access. I’ve stayed at several locations on the strip and the staff and facilities at Mirage are definitely at the top of my Vegas list. In particular the service staff and the food at our events are both 5 star! Thanks for a great Vegas trip.
30,nothing exceptional average hotel. lobby smell cigar and lemon the hotel look old not updated. was probably nice hot 30 year ago . location is nice but not exciting. Restaurant are expensive but doesn't provide the quality and tasty expected for what you spend.
10,Horrible hotel no service no coffees in the room no maps in the walkway. It was confusing to walk around without maps in the hotel The rooms were terrible and no coffee was provided. The check-in lines were painfully long.
40,This was our 2nd time in 2 years staying at the Mirage I do highly recommend this hotel as it is in a great location and is reasonably priced. The first time we did stay in suite on the top floor this time we had a regular room on the 17th floor which was a noticeable change and less describable. First glance the room seemed clean but after staying the 5 days we noticed some things that need to be changed and or updated. First the bathrooms are pretty small and outdated we did have issues with the shower head and faucet for leaks also quite a bit of black mold on the grout lines of the shower. When you flush the toilet every time it sprayed air back at you along with (fecal matter) its just a weird design maybe to much sucking power. The safe needed to be reset the first day by security (not a big deal) The house keeping staff came every morning and cleaned the bed and room. We did smell a cigarette smoke as well. Im pretty sure the rooms are non smoking but something was definitely going on. the do have a locked mini fridge that you cannot access to store your own water or beers in only the beers and snack provided by the hotel at an outrageous price point. It would be nice to have access to the fridge and coffee maker like other rooms. The view out of room was decent seen a lot of back roofing but a good mountain range. all in all the room was decent just needs minor updated (We did bring this to the attention of the front desk) Freddy - who was super helpful and genuinely cared! Big UPS Freddy!!! We did get offered a different room but we only had 2 nights left so we just stayed put in hindsight I probably should have said something on day 1.    The casino floor and shops are decent although we are table games players it would be nice to some some of the table minimums at $5 and $10 rather then 15-25$ especially when it is dead in the casino through the day and early mornings. We played quite a bit at random tables but found it quite hard to get free drinks (alcohol) and water and coffee (they should be handing out free waters and coffee like its going out of style not charging hotel guests for those products.    You do have quite a few food options in this hotel its is all pretty pricey though (great quality) but you pay for it. It would be nice to see 1 or 2 cheaper options in the hotel as I know a ton of people walk directly across the street to Walgreens McDonalds and White caslte.    My biggest complaint is the casino floor smelled VERY BAD of cigarettes we went through a ton of casinos last week in new and old Vegas unfortunately the mirage had 1 of the worst lingering smells ( need better ventilation) not just spraying a smell    The Mirage Front Staff are great! the Housekeepers are great! most of the dealers are great! but the guys running the luggage and taxis need some customer service skills.    Just a few small things to consider we will be coming back next year! Never stop improving!
50,Stayed at suite close to 1300 squaare feet on 28th Floor facing the main strip. Service was excellent from restaurant to room to Front Desk and Consierege. Suite was very clean and provided us with different rooms to relax. It was excellent for sitting and looking out at the mesmorizing evening lights.Will stay there again without a doubt.
30,We loved being able to walk over to the Venetian Cesars and the Bellagio. The hotel has great restaurant options. I highly recommend Costa Osteria! The rooms themselves need updating. The fabric headboards had rips and scratches all over them which we thought was pretty gross. For what we paid I think some basic updates like new headboards and paint is neccesary.
30,Main reason I stayed at the Mirage was for location. 70% of the restaurants and bars i go to are within walking distance. the hotel is just average the staff are really nice which makes me wanting to come back. the casino has alot of restaurants and bars
10,first time at Mirage they seemed more concerned about getting money from you than giving you a good experence. No coffee in the room  in the casino if you had change you were charged 10% to change it to dollar bills. If you stayed in the hotel cost was $ 15 a day took an arm and leg to get a drink in the casino.
10,I booked my room over 6 weeks out. I expected a king room because that’s what I booked and paid extra for. Upon check-in which I did mobile check-in to save time—I was informed no king rooms were available and that we would have to wait at least 3 hours for one to be available. Due to timing we were not able to wait that long and settled for a double queen room.  On top of the annoying set back of bed preferences I was also treated extremely poorly by the check-in person at the mobile check-in desk.  Kyle was who helped us and while we were standing there he made a phone call rather than finishing our transaction then making the call he did so while we were still needing direction to get to our room. We stood there confused if we should leave if we needed to sign anything etc. it was awkward and very uncomfortable and not a smooth transaction.  It was very poor customer service and for paying almost $200 for our room I was extremely disappointed with the poor service.  We arrived back to the hotel/casino at 1am we wanted to get some good before we heading back to the room. We waited in a very small line outside The Pantry for over 15 min. The hostess asked how many in our party there were 2 of us. She had us step to the side with a group of about 10 other people while she seated people behind us and we waited off to the side for another 10 min. Inside the restaurant you could clearly see empty tables everywhere. The bar was open there were only a handful of people.  After waiting for over 20 min we decided to try somewhere else. We walked to the Starbucks and were assisted immediately. When we walked back by The Pantry the same people we were by were still waiting to be seated.  Awful customer service and experience. And slowest assistance I’ve ever seen especially with empty tables through the place.
50,The Mirage is in a great location on the strip check in was quick and easy with friendly staff. Room was clean and spacious with cleaning every day. Would recommend this hotel and I intend to stay here again.
40,I was in Las Vegas in the beginning of November 2019 for a conference called The Market Research Event. Since the conference was at the hotel I decided to stay there. I stayed there for 6 nights in two different rooms. Below are my review on the stay    Pros:  1.Location. Mirage is located right in the center of the strip and therefore it is very easy to go either north or south of the LVB.  2. Rooms are spacious modern and comfortable  3. Lot of options for eating within the hotel - California Pizza Starbucks Still the sports bar etc    Cons:  1. No coffee station and drinking water in the room  2. Paid Parking. It's better to park at treasure island and walk to Mirage  3. Rooms were expensive than its neighbors - Treasure Island and Ceaser Palace.    This was my 10th trip to Vegas in Las Vegas in last 12 years.
10,The Wi-Fi disconnect my devices every minute. I saw the problem first day and called services in 2nd day they route me to a very stupid IVR and customer services and they promised to test the network the other day and called me back. Then the other day I got no message so I followed up they failed to connect my problem but anyway the guy said I could change a rooM.  Interestingly they never follow up then on changing my room.    Worst services and worst network in the world I wont come back. Well MGM group. Please be careful!
10,We used to enjoy the buffet before a night out at a comedy show at the Mirage. The food was good although the selection wasn’t the best. Well having to pay for drinks is no laughing matter. So on to the next one. MGM2020 strikes again!
30,We chose to spend a night at the Mirage because we were going to a comedy show there. The dinner choices were excellent as was the shopping and casino part of the tour. However we paid for a high-end room and when we checked in at 3pm the room was not ready. It took the staff over 15 minutes to try and contact housekeeping and that didn’t work. They offered us a different room that was lesser than the one we ordered. We were tired and took it. The headboard on the bed had a massive tear in it and the room felt a little dirty. Also if you leave your bags with the porters they won’t let you collect them. Rather you have to have them brought to your room when you are there - obviously expecting a tip in return.
50,Greeat food shows and staff. We are at Carnegie one last time and California Pizza. We saw circ du Soleil Love and the colour and music was none stop. It was the best part of the trip. I couldn't keep up with all the action!
10,Tips:  - The key cards in the doors are really bizarre you'll need a bit of practice to get the door to open.  - Rooms are grouped by floors and that's how you access elevators.  - Try to get a room in the 9-16 group and not lower and if you need to be closer to the elevators to avoid walking get XX001 to 6 (XX being the floor)    The good:  - Not much in this column other than the room was clean new and in good condition.    The bad:  - Reataurants are overpriced not a slot of selection or value for money.  - customer service for MGM is non existant (see detailed review below and my review of MGM grand from last year)    I had sworn off the MGM brand after last years visit to MGM Grand when they had given away my room to some else gave me another 'temp' room for the night and I had to check out the next morning at 11 pack everything up leave it with concierge and wait till 3pm till my actual room was ready and then check back in. Ridiculous since I had paid for and reserved a room for 3 nights. No apologies when I complained and was told a manager would reach out to me regarding this but no one did.    The reason I mention the above because lightning has struck twice. I was forced to book at Mirage (owned by MGM) because that's where 20 of my colleagues were staying for AWS re:Invent trade show. Once again I'm being asked to vacate my room in the middle of my stay. Now I have to leave my work and customers go and pack things up so I can be moved to another room. Really MGM?    If this is the case you've lost our company's business and I will 100% make sure that our company does not do business with the MGM brand. With 20 people and 4-5 shows per year in Vegas with 3 nights per person that's 300 nights a year that we will not spend on your brand not including dinners at your restaurants and other expenditure. I understand that's chump change for you in the grander scheme of things but it's the principle that matters and doing the right thing not how much or how little business a customer may provide. Every customer should be valuable to you. Somewhere along the line you've missed that.
10,To expensive!!! Rooms are dirty!!! The Holiday Inn was cleaner than this place. Pay for Parking??? Really. All of Vegas is not what it used to be. The showrooms look like a basement of someones home! Never again!!!
10,I would never normally complain but I can’t believe just how badly we have been treated.    We booked a package holiday with flight and 9 nights at the Mirage. We arrived last night to be told that there were no resort rooms available. I had emailed previously to request an upgrade to a deluxe tower resort room due to a decline in physical health (need separate cubicle not one in the bath). This was agreed and discounted for us.    I fully appreciate that it is Rodeo finals but being told it’s first come first served was a bit harsh. We booked this trip over 8 months ago. We were given a half suite for one night and given $50 food and beverage credit. Being tired from a 11 hour flight and with jet lag we accepted.    This morning we went to front desk and was told there still wasn’t a deluxe room available so was given 9 nights resort fees credited and told to stay in the room. This lady was lovely and said she will find us a room tomorrow. So surprise tonight to receive a call demanding we leave the room by 5pm. When I protested (saying we were given this room and told to stay in it tonight) I was told that it was mandatory that we leave and that we shouldn’t be in it and that security would escort us out if we didn’t move!!    So we moved to the room that keys were brought to us. I’m amazed at the lack of consideration. It’s the very last room in the corridor the furthest from the elevators.    I have called twice to discuss my complaint and 2 hours later I’m still waiting for Alex from guest relations to contact me back.    I’m appalled that guests are threatened with such humiliation (removal by security - to where?) and treated with such contempt.
10,Poor experience in the hotel. The bathroom did not have a lock. Billed for things never used. I had to change room because the previous room did'nt have bathroom lock and did not have cold water. The second room was no way better.
50,The start of the experience was great especially with the front desk help. They got me in early and my room  Faced the volcano. The sports bar is my favorite. Arnold Kurt Tony teoaday. All are great staff. I will come again soon
40,"This hotel was very good for the deal that I got. The deals were so good for my time of traveling that I got a room with a ""Strip view"". This unfortunately was a little deceiving because I DID have a strip view but it was out of the corner of the window and the majority of the view was the top of the main floor. If I had known this I wouldn't have paid the extra money.  But aside from this the hotel was very good."
50,We were treated very well by all staff from food to rooms to front desk. Location is excellent for all amenities on the strip and the Volcano show nightly is awesome and good for all ages. We would consider revisiting this hotel in the future.
20,This hotel will nickel and dime you. We were charged 18.00 for a damn bottle of water that sat on table! You are charged a resort fee which should be illegal. You dont use or need anything the resort fee covers whatsoever!
20,Check in process was poor... reservation was messed up and took too much time to resolve. Also the room assigned was already occupied  requiring a second trip to the front desk to resolve... never offered any kind of comp to make the poor execution more tolerable. I travel to Vegas 4 times a year.
50,nice clean place. friendly professional staff. casino is nice clean with great variety of games and slot machines. servers were fairly quick to refill your drinks as long as you tipped them which is understandable
40,I am very familiar with this property. Its in a great walking area when its not 30 degrees and windy. Its normally super clean this time not so much but it was fixed promptly. The casino and hotel were great. I recommend this property highly
50,Surprisingly great! We had a very good time from start to finish. Will consider for a second stay. Cravings Buffet simple an everyday restaurant that doesn’t break the bank! Just next to Caesar Palace!
50,We stayed for a short vacation. Checked-in online. Very easy and fast. Private elevator to 25th floor was nice. No stopping up or down. Room was redecorated and very nice. Staff is friendly and professional. Large selection of restaurants. The Beatles LOVE show is a must see. Overall we had a very nice stay.
30,"As first time visitors to Vegas the Mirage is right on the strip and is typically Vegas.  Room was fine - although a price list on the mini bar would be comforting.  Enjoyed our stay but would NOT stay there again.  Five of us has five nights in three rooms.  If you want to be stuck outside your room - which Is a considerable walk to the front desk - with your electronic key card not working then the Mirage is for you. This happened to at least one of us THREE times !?  If you want to check in and pay THREE hefty room deposits lodging a credit card for further charges to be taken if they think you will spend more then the Mirage is for you.  We did that but didn't charge much to our room. On the fourth night we tried only to be told by a barman that we had to pay cash as we had no card lodged....it was very embarrassing !  So another long walk to wait in another long queue..... ""oh we deleted it by mistake sorry"".  Small things but simply NOT good enough for the prices charged.  We will return to Vegas we loved the experience but we will stay either at another strip hotel or maybe even just say downtown in Fremont (probably better to get taxi back to strip for a show rather than get cabs each day down to Fremont)  Certainly Fremont casinos more fun more atmosphere quicker drinks and more payouts than the casino within the Mirage.  On a positive note the steak restaurant was VERY good but you don't have to be a resident to enjoy a meal there."
20,No free parking resort fee was too much for what was available. No fridge or microwave. I could've saved more money with free breakfast and parking at the Best Western across the street. Other hotels were so much better and cleaner. The cigarette smoke just lingered all over the place. Volcano show was cancelled due to wind but wasn't announced of the cancellation till a minute after it was supposed to start. People stood in the cold waiting for nothing. Should've announced it prior to the show.
50,Extremely family friendly. Love the atrium and all the amenities the hotel has to offer. Love the fact that it’s so conveniently located in the middle of the strip so you don’t have to walk miles to get to places.
50,The rooms were top notch the staff friendly the dining is second to none. With the exception of Caesars every other place looked like a dump. If you're staying in Vegas stay at the Mirage visit the other casinos.
50,Stayed at The Mirage with my girlfriend for a week and thoroughly enjoyed it! From start to finish the chap on the check in desk was superb and gave us a nice upgrade. Room was spacious and comfortable. The buffet fantastic and great value. The Beatles LOVE was phenominal and we even had some good luck in the casino. Fantastic stay and we would definitely return!
50,I came in wondering what my experience was going to be like; arrived too early to check-in but was met by staff that seemed very eager to help with luggage and advise that I might be able to check-in early if there was an empty room. There was a variety of loose modern slot machines though I seem to have sat in only one or two machines because I enjoyed them---I did not feel tired hungry or sleepy for an entire night! Then I came up to a clean spacious room with simple soothing colors. Every staff was friendly smiling and ever ready to help- from concierge to check-in to casino to house-keeping! And what delicious seafood food at the buffet!
20,"The last time I stayed at the Mirage was almost 10 years ago. Back then it was a nice hotel with clean comfortable rooms and a decent casino. I think it's a far cry from that now and I probably won't be back.    The beds were really hard and uncomfortable. The shower was rusted out in certain spots and there was gunk on the walls. It needed a deep cleaning. Matter of fact the whole place could use a deep clean including the casino. Slot machines seemed to be constantly dirty with trash and empty glasses everywhere. The casino smelled awful. Like a bad combination of stale cigars cigarettes and their signature ""scent"" pumped into the whole place. They offer rooms that are non-smoking but good luck getting to them without smelling like an ash tray. Not a good place for asthmatics or those with allergies at all. None of the other casinos (Venetian Caesars Paris Wynn Flamingo) smelled like that so I don't know what was wrong with this hotel. They need to check their ventilation or something.    The last straw for me was the lack of sleep. I don't know if I was on the party floor or what (room for 1 as a 30-ish female) but it was obnoxiously loud all night long. People screaming and rowdy until 2-3 am in the morning. I finally got fed up and called the front desk on my last day because one of the rooms nearby started to sound like there was some kind of domestic incident ocurring. Housekeeping consistently started making rounds about 8 am each day. No matter how hard I tried or how early I went to bed no sleep for me. That's the whole purpose of a hotel. If I can't sleep you aren't functioning well as a hotel."
50,One of the best things about the mirage is the the rooms have ample drawer space so there is no chance of having to scrimp. You can always unpack everything. Great location center strip. Convenient to main highways and nice backdoor access.
50,Great views Great food the best overall experience I will definitely be staying there again! Keep up the great work all around enjoy my stay here at the Mirage! Nothing bad to say about this hotel and my experience.
50,Great Hotel Service! The hotel is older but I could not tell well maintained. Also I dont know if they have good air circulation or if there were less smokers but the air quality was better than most. Its been ten years since I've stayed at the hotel but i was very happy with the service and quality of the room. I visit vegas about 5 times a year and stay at a variety of hotels. The best reference I could give is that I would be happy to visit the Mirage again.
30,The room was large clean and well appointed. We did have a problem with the in room safe that took several calls to correct to correct. The casino is on the dark side and smoky. The Sports Book is a no smoking area but the smell of cigarettes is still pervasive. There is a good selection of restaurants in the complex with something for everyone.
50,We love this hotels location most of everything. It’s check in process is so easy because they have a mobile check in counter if you check in via the email they send a day ahead of time. So the line is always short. The Parking structure is so close to the hotel. As soon as you exit the structure it brings you straight to the check in desks. No need to walk the casino with your luggage trying to find the front desk my reason for staying here is ease!!!!
10,"I stay in Vegas quite a bit in fact I am platinum with MLife and I was just here two weeks ago at this same hotel and received less than average service but today takes the cake. During check in again for the 2nd time in a row I was told I could not get the king I reserved as there were no more left. After I complained and asked why this keeps happening I was offered an upgraded room for $25 if I wanted a king. I laughed the clerk ""refreshed"" his screen and said magically there is now a king. Got up to my room went to start putting things away noticed there were some small black stains on the sheets okay that's fine I thought. Pulled out the nightstand because I wanted to plug my phone in sauce container lid and a ton of dust. At this point I say to myself thats a little gross so I look around the room more. I turn on all of the lights find trash on the floor like it hasn't been vacuumed and then next to the TV area a clipped toenail. At this point I call the front desk and ask for a supervisor to come take a look at my room. They offer without looking to switch me rooms I said well I want a king bed and I was told that was the only one left the host said she will look told me no problem I have found another room for you surprise I'm sitting in my double queen bed room right now as I type this. On the way out I took a look in the bathroom looks like shaving cream or toothpaste on the mirror the headboards are covered in dust. She assures me she will re-program my keys from downstairs for my new room so I do not have to drag all of my luggage. I head up to my new room my keys do not work. I called the front desk from my phone at 8:28 they told me they would send security up to unlock my door for me at 8:48 I was finally let in to my room which included some peppermint candy on the floor some food crumbs and two queen beds which I specifically made a point to clarify that I want what I booked. At this point im finally in a room over an hour after I arrived on property it's not even worth me calling back down to the front desk instead I decided to post this review and include pictures. Luckily I have booked a room at the Wynn in addition to this room tomorrow and it may not take much for them to lure me over there to gamble and stay after this experience."
20,We stayed here thinking it would be a great place and were very much looking forward to a good hotel on the strip! Boy were we wrong!!!    There isn’t a lot of good I can say about this hotel other than location is good and SOME of the staff were lovely and helped when we had issues with our room. While others were rude and unpleasant.    The hotel is in desperate need of some love and care the hotel corridors are dark and uninviting not to mention the banged up/dirty walls and carpet.    Our room issues were the windows to view the strip/volcano which you pay good money for were filthy!!! When sending photos to people they thought it was raining and even commented on how dirty they were (just from the picture!!). The ‘block out’ curtains had rips in them so you would often wake to the sun in your face if you didn’t waste your time the night before trying to get them closed strategically (there wasn’t just one rip there was multiples). I would of thought housekeeping would of noticed it and changed them. Our toilet didn’t always flush you could hear the room next door whenever they went to shower/toilet  One positive was the pillows and beds were comfortable which is important    We valet parked our car which cost $24USD per day ($15USD for self park) you can come and go as much as you like however when calling down so we didn’t have to wait 10-15mins in the freezing cold we were told they aren’t taking call downs at that time.    The pool was undergoing renovation not that it was warm enough to swim anyway.    Overall for the cost I wouldn’t recommend this hotel and would definitely say look around last time I stayed at treasure island and it was ALOT nicer and worth the money
50,The mirage hotel is the vacation spot best service best food and best show on the strip the beatles LOVE.Winter or summer the pool is great the front desk aquarium is beautiful as well as the waterfall and greenery.You should go
10,Mirage has gone to hell along with Mlife they treat you like a lemming rude ignorant. They lie one hand has no idea what the other is doing. Used to be my favorite hotel. Never again! $25 for a BLT! Absolutely insane!
20,Hotel was certainly not worth the money.  hotel is run down and shows by the # of people you see in the casino.  Drinks overpriced food overpriced and policies are not guest friendly  Their are much newer places to stay for same money with friendlier guest policies
50,We travel a lot! We were so excited for our Thanksgiving trip to the Mirage. We dont have any family and thought this would be a nice time to visit Vegas and see their Christmas villages and the Mirages volcano. Unfortunately the Cajon pass was closed and we had to turn around and go back home with little girls after hours of traffic into more traffic. :( Andrew at the Mirage was so kind and understanding. He refunded our room on extreme short notice and wished us a happy holiday. When we visit during better weather we will only consider the Mirage. Thank you so much!
50,My college age daughter and I had a very nice experience at the Mirage Hotel/Casino. I was there for business and took some time with my daughter to explore Las Vegas and surrounding area. Her first time however I've been there several times before.    Booked trip as a package on expedia and it worked great! Nice price and convenient. Some suggestions are: Reserve your room in advance (we got the Volcano view) and check in early to ensure you get the best selection. For example if your are not happy with your location/bed selection you still have time for them to change it...Later in the afternoon/evening they may have less availability to fix.    Friendly and helpful staff. Clean rooms/property...Well maintained. - I've stayed there a few times over the years and it is better than the rest of the hotels on the strip where I have stayed.    Highlights were Hoover Dam tour Breakfast at The Stack (Mirage Cafe) Dinner at Nacho Daddy's (Freemont St.) Rollercoaster at New York New York Casio. and KA (Cirque du soleil) which was excellent!!    M-Life rewards card is a good bet...Free to sign up and I received a deep discount on show tickets at MGM properties.    We also received a $30 a day voucher for meals/amenities...Very nice touch! Ask at the front dest during check in.
10,3 different rooms. Endless problems Guest services hung up on me because the claimed they didnt want to hear me pout. Horrible overall. Left a day early a checked in a competitor's hotel. Dont waste your time in this once infamous hotel in decline.
50,We arrived at about 10 at night and they were out of regular rooms so they upgraded us to a full sized suite with 2 bathrooms etc. The slots were fair enough that we could play for hours and not lose our shirts. All on property restaurants were on the pricey side. Did not try the buffet.
20,We looked at pictures of this hotel and the pictures were a lot nicer than what we actually got. The rooms felt dirty and they were tiny and outdated. The casino was really smoky and noisy to walk through.
40,Hotel Service was great and many putty and Mortar can be seen to repair room damage. Overall great excitement and experience. Buffet is not bad and Mlife is worth joining to get rewards as well as buffet and show offers. Expect to pay resort fees about $35-40 per night on top of the stay price
50,Nice staff fun casino good selection of restaurants in the hotel that changed Vegas forever it still delivers. Very convenient location on the Strip makes it easy to walk o some of the other large casinos.
50,The location of the Mirage is very convenient to walk to the main areas of the strip for sightseeing including the Promenade area. The Mirage Pool is awesome when open. The restaurants are a great variety and the Breakfast Buffet is perfect! Food is tasty on a great variety on the buffet. LVB Burger CPK Carnegie Deli and the other restaurants are all great! Beds are very comfortable. Rooms are very clean. I have stayed her about 6 times and really like it because it is not too big and is easy to navigate.
50,upgrade as able but make sure you order the Rueben from Carnegie. The craps tables could use some action with a $10. time or area. as we were there 4 days and didnt feel drawn to it as there few people enjoying. The rooms were quiet and the location is amazing
40,Loved the beds and pillows. Housekeeping was thorough. Casino is conveniently located on the strip to walk to other areas. Easy to use Uber transportation from the pickup area. Could use more reasonably priced all american restaurant on premises. Deli is only fair priced restaurant.
40,The room was kind of a fiasco. They put us in a room that someone was already in. It all got worked out. The restaurants were amazing. The shows were excellent. Highly recommend the Cirque Du Solei LOVE. The comedy was great.
50,The Mirage  Honest feedback  This Hotel is Great!!!!  Very Clean and Spacious Rooms good big size! Bed extremely comfortable.  Check in staff was fantastic and upgraded us on arrival.  The concierge team did wonders getting me a table at Hells kitchen for my partners birthday thank you so much.  The Secret garden was out of this world and they are all looked after so well yes the animals are in captivity but no doubt they are loved and well loved after.  We also saw boys 2 men at the Mirage and they was just amazing!    Yes it's TRUE about the mini bar Aviod touching it or even looking at it  Bottle of water will set you back $18    Tip walk across the street to the convenience store and pay $2.99 for the same bottle!  Down load uber and get a uber to the airport $16 we paid $40 coming off the plane!!!! Good tip that one.  Also Definitely go see the Micheal Jackson Tribute at the Stratospheric Amazing.    Yes vegas is expensive its Triple London prices but guys/girls you are in vegas c'mon???    And if you want a huge shock walk next door to Treasure island Hotel and have the shock of your life it's terrible and dirty.    And I was So Thankful i picked The Mirage    Thank you Mirage!!!
40,Over all my trip was a good one  other then the issue with the food we enjoyed our trip. I wish the Pantry staff would have just refunded me for the purchase and it would have made me feel like my business was appreciated there.
10,I stayed at the mirage again after there customer service ensured me the issues I had there before would be resolved. The dealers not friendly. Would not even comp a buffet after I spent more than 4000.00 of money. Staff not very helpful when I asked for a $30.00 buffet  Do not stay here not a very nice place. If u do stay here let me know how bad your experience was.
50,Had a great time at Mirage. This was the first time staying here. Room is clean spacious and comfy. Check in and out with ease friendly staff and not as crowded (vs Caesars).  There is an Avis car rental for your convenience. Great restaurants for all day meals. Remember not to miss the volcano show at night in front of the hotel.
20,did not have room ready at check in time. on top of that they did not have the room i had originally payed for. then they gave me another option only to tell me that that too was not ready. i ended up getting my room almost 2 hours after. on top of that. they charge for valet parking 24$. in the time i being going to Las  Vegas this is the first time.
50,When I was on the way too Vegas from L.A I was down about not staying at palms place expecting Mirage not to be as great.Soon as I drove in the valet section the service was great.the check in was really fast and really helpful.when I walked in my room my whole perspective changed I had the volcano view my kids fell in luv with.I really enjoyed my stay at the mirage hope too see it soon.Again thank you for your service
40,Nice Place close to everything. don’t touch the mini bar or the water or any snacks. My friend was a diabetic and he unfortunately needed a snack and a place to store his insulin. Bad mistake 2 waters and 2 snacks was like $72.00. I think they even charged us because we moved something in the fridge to make room for his medicine. Nice place just don’t touch any food or drink!!
30,I really like The Mirage and would definitely be writing a very positive review but during my stay money and receipts from slot machines disappeared from our room safe. No cameras passports or electronics were taken just U.S. cash (they left my Canadian money). In hindsight we are wondering why security was on our floor quite a bit before we had our theft issue. The MIrage is a nice hotel just don't leave cash in your room safe - or it will be what stays in Vegas.
30,Rooms stunk of mildew. Horrible smoke filtration. The buffet was awful and the restaurants are very over priced for the quality compared to other M-Life properties. The highlight is the breakfast/pancake restaurant.
50,From start to finish we enjoyed our stay at the mirage from the champagne handed out at check in the choice of room type we were asked by the friendly receptionist and to the end with a smooth checkout and speedy bell boys we were constantly in awe of the amazing service. We had a room on the 18th floor facing the strip the room was clean and fresh with a great hot shower we used the smaller Bare pool as the main pool was closed for the Sean most years we were told in is closed November to jan or feb dependant on when the maintenance finish this is something winter guests should be aware of before booking. The hotel has a lively atmosphere bars with live entertainment and many restaurants to choose from we gambled a little having never been to Vegas the dealer taught me how to play and the rules of cards and roulette every staff member we spoke to was friendly helpful and chatty even the security team were there to help and make the mirage a safe and happy haven on the busy strip in sin city. Highly recommended great value and luxury combined.
40,We found it very walkable to many hotels and shows. Room and bathroom had plenty of space . Of course plenty of gambling and restaurants. We only ate at the Pantry for breakfast which was very good. Has self parking or valet. If you do self parking make sure you drop your bags off at the from entrance or north valet. If you don’t you will carrying your own bags and it’s a long walk.
50,Got this room from the my Vegas app. Wasn’t too sure on what to expect so didn’t have high expectations but boy was I glad I went. 2 free nights Friday and Saturday? Had a blast with this deal definitely worth it.
30,Older strip hotel that has done nice renovations. Clean good sized room. Good restauubrants. Good buffet. Reasonable wait time to check in. Very friendly staff.  Room had issues with lots of lights out slow drains. Left note and all fixed next day. Nice. Bed was shot with major indention on right size. Need to replace. Overall happy with stay for a convention. Best was the friendly happy staff
30,I absolutely love the Mirage. It's a solid property in so many aspects. However the cocktails have gone downhill. I believe they have a machine making them the waitress said they could not make a bloody mary or virgin mary .... I ended up having a margarita it was awful. On this trip I had a number of margaritas at El Cortez Golden Nugget and Main Street - they were all good or very good how the Mirage fairs so terribly against these modest properties puzzles me. Not good!
30,We had a conference at the mirage and we stayed here and also were attending events at Caesar too.    The room was ok nothing fancy just like any other hotel room. The casino compared to other hotels is slow and not a lot ppl playing here compared to Paris Wynn belagio or others.    The services at the banquet was horrible. At lunch few of us required veggi which it never showed up so we ended up not eating the 1st day of the event.    I think I will not stay here again as the options in Vegas are many to go spend money than this place.
40,I will definently be back. My note are just my observations. As a weekend get away or conference space the Mirage is a great location. The staff at the Still were awesome. Several ofnua did not understand how a bar that is full of patrons close but understood the process. Jessica was aweaome and you should do the needful to keep her.. Hope to aee them again next year. cheers.
10,Mirage management should be ashamed for charging $18 bottle of water. In Vegas dry climate water is a necessity and not a luxury it should be a courtesy to leave a few bottles for guests. ITS PURE GREED!!!!
40,We were here for the Big Smoke so lots of smokers in the casino! Nice hotel overall a mature classier clientele to some other hotels on the strip. Left my phone twice in the casino and it was handed in! Excellent food at Stack and Japanese restaurants. Great Cirque Show. Coffee shops had huge line up in morning! Don't touch anything in fridge or on display or you will be billed! So you can't use the fridge for your own beverages or food! Big pool was under repair! Resort fee is $37 despite half the resort being closed!
20,Spent a week in vegas for a convention and stayed at The Mirage. The issues started as soon as I arrived.    I completed the electronic check in process and was supposed to receive an email when my room was ready. O never received the email. I went to concierge to ask where I could store my baggage until my room was ready and I was told that they did not know and no further assistance was given. I had to figure this out for myself.    When I got tired of walking the strip hour later I stopped by the electronic check in to see if my room was ready. It was ready and I was given room keys. I upgraded to a tower room with a larger room for $20.00 extra per night. The room was not larger and was standard...so what do the normal rooms look like?    I went to the 24th floor and entered room 108 and found someone's luggage on the floor opened back pack on the bed. Clearly someone had just checked into this room.    I immediately called down to the front desk and was told that the room was not supposed to be occupied. That really didnt matter since it clearly was occupied. I asked to speak to a manager and was told there was a glitch with their electronic check in system and the room was indeed occupied. Duh!! I expressed my concerns regarding a security breach being that I was in this person's room without their consent with their belongings and I worried about this happening to me. To my surprise this didnt seem to be a concern for management. All I received were excuses. I felt like my concerns were not heard at all and was just brushed off.    The toilet in my new room did not work properly. I had to flush the toilet 3 to 4 times after each use in order for the toilet to flush completely.    The handle to the shower faucet was loose. The bathroom was not cleaned properly was there was black long hair in the shower and sink.    The buffet was not worth it as the food had no flavor.    The swimming pool was closed for renovations.    Stay somewhere else. I do not expect a perfect stay anywhere but I do expect good customer service when I bring my concerns to management. Management doesn't care and neither do the employees.
50,Fabulous hotel not to be missed. What really made our time great was Ruby who checked us in took the time to tell us where everything is and informed us that our deal with AARP gave us $30 off our meals every day! I never would have known that!    Our room was next to an ice maker and the incredibly friendly and helpful Craig got us a quiet room we've really enjoyed. Way to go you two!
40,Location is the North end. Close to the Paris Caesars and others. The room we had was on the strip side so had a good view of the volcano which goes of on the hour 18:00 till 11:00. Few locations to eat and prices are competitive the $40 odd you are required to pay per night is offset a little by the hotel giving you back $30 per night against food or drink purchases in the hotel as a not the Starbucks at the entrance counts. We used this a few times and put it on the hotel bill and does not show unless you have spent more than $30. The Love show at the hotel is worth seeing and ticket prices in the hotel were competitive.
10,The check in was extremely slow even though there was only 3 people in front of us it took 40 minutes to be seen I have no idea why it is so slow.  When we finally made it to the front we were told our reserved king room wasn’t available and we would be put in to a queen room. We were really upset as we were on honeymoon and we found the beds too small to sleep in so had to sleep apart but he said there was nothing that could be done and waived a day resort fee we were too tired after being awake for 24 hours we just wanted to go to sleep so we reluctantly agreed.  The following day we went back to reception to explain we were upset with this being our honeymoon that we were in separate beds the receptionist said there were no king rooms still and the only option would be for us to pay for an upgraded king room we were left with no choice but to agree to pay $30 plus taxes for our remaining 5 nights otherwise the whole trip would of been a disappointment. It doesn’t seem right to me that if the hotel has given away our reserved room that we have to pay to get a king room the only upgraded thing about it was a bigger bathroom which we don’t care about we just wanted the room we booked and feel they’ve given us no option but to pay extra to get a king room. Please can someone from the hotel contact me to get this money back to us.  We were also disappointed that the main pool wasn’t open it was our main reason for booking as it says heated all year around however only a tiny pool was available I think the resort fee should be discounted to reflect the reduced resort facilities.
50,excellent stay staff is always friendly and professional. rooms were clean and comfortable. we always have fun at the Rhum Bar. The music and atmosphere there is incredible. We met new friends and had a great time hanging out.
40,We stayed here recently for three nights and was our second visit to The Mirage.    For a video review of our room (and of the Volcano eruption as seen from our room) please head over to You.Tube and search for 'Tim and Matt's Travel Reviews' for this and other Vegas room reviews)    The resort is the original mega resort of Vegas and has been kept in great condition. It has a tropical 'dome' inside with water features which makes it feel open and airy.    Check in to our resort tower room was efficient and only took a few minutes. Resort tower rooms are all on the 24th and 25th floor with express elevators so we never found ourselves waiting for an elevator nor did we even ever share one!    The room itself is similar to a standard resort room. The big bonus is that you're always going to get a great view. We were lucky enough to look over the volcano but be warned - if you are there for work or like an early night the volcano eruption is very loud and you can hear it clearly from the rooms looking over it.    The room was clean although the bed was a little soft for me but this is just a personal thing. Housekeeping was great each day. The bathroom in these rooms are bigger than the standard resort rooms with a separate shower and bath tub and a dual vanity with a huge mirror.    This was the second time we have stayed here and although not immediately we would stay here again.
40,"The good: We booked a penthouse suite...it was HUGE and had great panoramic views of both the mountains and strip. Extremely comfortable and felt like we had our own strip apartment. Staff were all very pleasant and polite. Cravings Buffet was an excellent value for the money (anyone who says it's overpriced hasn't been to Bacchanal Bellagio or the Wynn) and the spa service providers were excellent (detailed in a separate review). The dolphin habitat was fun and good for kids.    The not so good: Mobile check in was a disaster...our room wasn't ready and although the staff were pleasant I'm not amused by ""we'll text you to give you an approximation of when your room will be ready I'll go ahead and give you the room number in good faith just don't go in there until you get our notification."" It came across as though the Mirage is doing me a favor by letting me stay there.    Aside from a horrible check in experience it was a good stay and the hotel itself is interesting. I think they would benefit greatly from having a separate check in for the penthouses and M Life Rewards members. If I stay again I will just check in manually and bring a good novel to read until my room is ready."
50,Excellent hotel and the show LOVE was outstanding.  Would definately go back  Clean and grindy hotel  Good value  Would recommend the hotel and area good spot on the strip  Fantastic view from the position of it so locality spot on
50,We had great view from our room. Checking in and out was super easy and fast. Would definitely recommended this hotel and will be staying there again. This hotel is in great location on the strip makes walking places super easy and convenient
30,A little old hotel with rooms that are not so updated. Rooms looks old and not that clean. Towels doesnt look very clean and white. Location is good along the strip. The main pool is closed for renovation till March 2020.
20,Stayed at the Mirage about 8 years ago and liked the property. Sadly over those years the competition has advanced while the Mirage stayed the same. OK well not quite the same. There are more and better restaurants - though still only two for breakfast and they are overcrowded and over-priced. The halls remain dingy and are becoming severely worn. The biggest let down was my room. I was upgraded to a Strip view but my window was so dirty I couldn't see out. My room's fixtures had remained unchanged: carpet worn drawers wobbled chair loose. Worst were the mattress - soft and floppy with an odd hump in the center (not really sure I want to know what caused that) and a bathroom with numerous loose pieces of chrome water that went from freezing to scalding instantaneously and a ticking (yes it sounded like a clock) water-saving toilet that takes at least 3 flushes to do its job. Then there was the check-in process itself. We arrived early about 2:00pm and were told our room was not yet ready but we would receive a text when it was. OK. I hadn't heard anything by 4:00pm (an hour past check in). Went back to the front stood in line for 20 minutes and was told my room was ready over an hour ago! To be fair I did get a text with my room number - AT 6:03pm. Not exactly stellar service. No the Mirage has fallen behind its competitors. Way behind its sister property the Aria where I stayed back in February and couldn't have been happier. It appears the Mirage has shimmered on its laurels a little too long. A complete make over and service revision is in order or be content to be second tier.
30,It is a nice hotel but we had booked a room at the Mirage hotel for the Resort King Tower room with a view of the volcano but instead received a room with a view of the back parking lot. We spoke to the front desk and they only offered to downgrade us to a regular room with two queen sized beds and only credited us $20. We were not too happy and will likely stay at a different resort for our next trip to Vega .
50,Had such a good time staying here. Really clean facility. The staff is smiling and ready to help. This is a great location. Right in the middle of everything. The swimming pools are beautiful! Rhumbar has the best drinks on the strip.
40,Yes this is an older hotel but they have done a great job keeping it up! The only time I saw the age is the door on the bathroom in my room (clearly old and painted) and a tile in my shower had a big chip that they plastered in versus replacing the tile. Otherwise this is a high class hotel! Staff are helpful. Restaurants and shops are good (which you find all over Vegas) but I would say one if the best parts of this hotel is the location along with the fact that it’s a higher class hotel. The volcano show is excellent and you can walk to all the other higher class hotels and restaurants. I would definitely recommend staying at the Mirage!
30,When we checked in the only room available was a handicapped accessible room. She said it had a shorter bed and shower head and we could change it the next day if we didn't like it. We took the room. When we got to our room there was a big contraption next to the bed and a potty chair and other handicapped items in the bathroom. We didn't like that at all so we went down (stood in a long line again) and asked to change rooms the next day. They gave us new keys for the new room and said they would let us know when it was ready. We go up to our room that night around 11:00pm to go to bed and neither of our keys worked. We had to go downstairs again and get in another long line behind a large group of tire guys to find out what was going on. I asked them if my old keys didn't work because I got new keys and maybe they forgot to text me with my new room. No they just didn't work. Then we go to our room to go to bed and someone had come in our room and taken the large contraption out and some stuff from the bathroom. It was nice it was gone but I didn't like the fact that someone came in our room without letting us know. I had expensive items laying out that I would not normally have had out. The next day we get in a long line again to find out what to do with our luggage while waiting for our new room because we were going to be gone all day. We finally got that taken care of and left. Late that afternoon we get in long line again to get our new room because they didn't text me a room number. We told the gentleman helping us that we have spent more time in line than anything else. He apologized and said he would give us a $40 food and drink credit on our room. That was very nice but still not too happy. Finally we were settled in our new room. The room was nice but the shower head was terrible. It was one that you can remove but it wasn't very high on the wall and when you tried to make it as tall as it would go it would fall again. Very annoying! It was too short for me at 5' 4 and definitely too short for my husband. Lastly when we did our checkout on the TV and there was no $40 credit. We couldn't do anything about it because we didn't know the gentleman's name who had said he would give it to us. Needless to say the four nights we stayed at the Mirage was a huge disappointment.This used to be my favorite place to stay but not any more.
30,The Mirage was exactly what you'd expect. It's an expensive but well-run hotel and casino. It's very big and for food and bedrooms it is necessary to walk through the enormous casino. This was what we expected and were not disappointed.  What we didn't like was our encounter with a concierge. We found a helicopter tour on-line which we asked her to book for us to save time and trouble. She said she was allowed only to book Maverick tours which was significantly more expensive than our choice of Sundance and as far as we could determine the tours were identical. When we asked her why she could not book our choice she said the hotel was concerned for our safety. When I asked her how many helicopters Sundance had lost she was stuck for a reply.  I can only conclude the Mirage has negotiated a bigger commission from Maverick and is prepared to rubbish other firms to get it. I don't know if this practice is legal but it is certainly nasty and it doesn't say much for the management who put the concierge in this position. I am not sure if this practice is general or confined to America Las Vegas or the Mirage but it certainly stinks.
10,Mirage resort pool closed for maintenance with no advanced notice yet we were still charged a high resort fee. Other Las Vegas resorts indicate the operating season/ condition of their pools prior to making a reservation. We arrived only to find out that the resort pool was closed. A small adults only pool was open and was filled beyond capacity. The resort still charged a $49 resort fee even though the facility was closed. Would not stay here again. For $50 stay at the Venetian - much nicer hotel feels like a true resort same location!
30,Expected the rooms to be more updated. Our room was basic with a few surprising sore eyes like the shear curtains was trashed and no toilet paper holder. Bed was comfortable and you could request feather pillows. Staff worked had to please and were kind and respectul.
20,This resort is a pain in the a$$.    I recently purchased a new truck which is 6’11”. The parking garage at the Mirage is one of the shortest at only 6’9”. I called a month prior to our stay to inquire about parking for my vehicle. After being passed around to four different people I was assured that there was an on-site parking lot to accommodate guests like me. Great.    The big truck is partially so that my 6’7” husband is comfortable on road trips. Due to his height we only make reservations for king size beds...cal Kong’s are better but a king is a must. We had reserved a king deluxe room which is apparently their standard room.    Imagine my dismay upon arriving to the resort to wander around the various back streets following signs to “oversized parking lot” and not finding any such thing in existence. Went in a few circles thinking “it’s a freaking parking lot for large vehicles how hard can it be to find??” We finally pulled into a driveway with a security booth. The guard there explained that there have been temporary tents erected on the oversized parking lot (for a couple months) and directed us around the corner and across the street to their current oversized lot. No shuttle service. Just us our luggage and nearly a mile hike.    There are no straight lines no closer entrances and at that time we didn’t know a bell desk existed since the security guard sent us to the valet entrance where there isn’t a bell desk.    Right. The valet and the bell desk are at different entrances. Doesn’t make sense to me either.    After our hike to the registration desk we weren’t thrilled and told the desk employee we weren’t happy that no one told us about the lot closure. All we got was an “I’m sorry.” He then went on to inform us that there were no more king rooms available. I about lost my cool. I walked away my husband explained that we had reserved a king room and that he (obviously) didn’t fit in a queen bed. The employee got on the phone never spoke a word to anyone for ten minutes then hung up and said he “found” a king room.    From the front desk to the elevators is another trek. The elevators are completely across the casino from check in. Seriously it’s a long freaking ways especially with bags.    The room was average but comfortable (the only reason for the two stars). There aren’t obvious power outlets near the bed. You have to move the entire bed away from the wall to access the outlet if you have a cpap machine or want your phone charging on the night stand.    The bathroom was tiny. When we got to the room there was still toilet paper in the toilet. The exhaust fan didn’t do anything but make noise. It didn’t actually vent the bathroom which was confirmed by the engineer who came to fix the AC after we heard water trickling from the unit. Seriously.    The overall resort is beautiful but it comes at a price. All the on-site dining options were pricy. The most economical seemed to be CPK which looked like it had fairly standard pricing. Everything else had jacked up prices. $19 for street tacos? $18 for a burger fries were $8 more. The brunch buffet for two was $50 and the food was mediocre. I understood why the line was so long at the only other place open for breakfast.    The resort wants to nickel and dime you for everything. The rooms have a mini bar and snack tray which are monitored by weight...pick something up you get charged automatically. It makes it so that you can’t use the fridge which in our room had an incessant hum like a distant cicada.    My husband sent one of his shirts out to be cleaned and pressed for the event we were attending. We got a message left on the phone saying we had to trek down to the registration desk to pay for the cleaning then go to the bell desk to pick up the shirt. When we got down to the front desk it took 25 minutes four employees and a manager to print the receipt for us to take to the bell desk(I’m not exaggerating).    Apparently if you pay with a debit card they tell you they put an extra $100 hold on the card. Okay I get the premise of the deposit but why not tell us that no incidentals (like laundry) are covered? They told us when we paid for the shirt that authorizing room charges would necessitate an additional $100/day deposit.    Honestly the fact that the event we attended was at this resort is the only reason I would go back. I’m hoping like hell it will be elsewhere next year.    If they wanted to improve the experience an on-call shuttle for the distant parking would be a start...I can’t imagine doing that walk in the summer. A closer access point would work too. Also better signage for the bell desk and the valet or better communication from their employees.
50,Excellent hotel.    Centrally located on the LV Strip    Friendly staff who are always helpful.    Excellent restaurants on site.    Fitness centre is amazing- lots of modern equipment.    Nice relaxing pool.    We always stay here because we have never been disappointed.
40,The hotel was nice. We requested a King size room and when we checked in that was not available so we were given a double queen room. The mobile checkin was unavailable since they didn’t have a room for us and I had paid prior to arriving so that was frustrating.
50,The Mirage was an excellent experience on our recent golf trip to LV.  Room was large clean and comfortable. Heritage Steak House was excellent - food and service. Great fitness center! Would recommend highly!
30,The location is great. Friendly staff and helpful conierge . The condition of the rooms are quite poor. They are need of an update or a though cleaning wallpaper headboard dirty and in poor condition even our room door needed a good scrubbing. The pool was closed without being notified. Adult pool was open but it was not a pleasant atmosphere since it was packed with unhappy people waiting for chairs.
40,Stayed here to see the Beatles show. Room was clean bed comfortable. Hotel has all the amenities without being so large as to have trouble finding way around. Convenient for walking and seeing the sights as well as shopping. Casino was not as smoky as some we went into on the strip. Plenty of restaurant options in and around the hotel. Over all a good value.
40,Stayed here for 4 nights. Room very spacious and clean. Drinks in the bars are a bit pricey and cravings buffet has plenty of food to choose from. Breakfast was lovely especially the omelette that was cooked fresh for you. Be aware though the breakfast is $19.99 per person during the week but rises to $35 at weekends and is called breakfast brunch as they put more food out. Way too expensive and doesn’t really justify the jump in price.  Very central hotel and the volcano erupting is amazing. Staff are all very friendly and polite.
50,The rooms at the Mirage are great. So clean roomy and very nice. Casino is wonderful. Lots of games and very nice. We were able to walk everywhere and used the tram from Treasure Island once as well.
10,Hotel was very smoky everywhere. Even room stunk like mold and old smoke. Would not consider this a resort hotel. No in room dining no bathrobes and main pool not open. Would have been nice to know when booking. Drink service in casino was few and far between and certainly not friendly. 2 regular coffees in the Pantry restaurant were 12 dollars. Room needed a good cleaning thick dust on doors headboard and baseboards carpet edges and behind nightstands was filthy. Would not recommend. This is a best western with tile..... way overpriced .
20,Pool was closed. What a let down. Can of coke in room was $10. Food good and well prepared. I had to wait long time in line nearly everywhere. I won’t come back. Why was my room window glued shut. I see others open. Nice flowers in lobby.
50,Room was very nice and staff at the front desk who help me to check in.Room wasn't ready but once the room was clean they text to me that room is ready to check in. it was very present and staff was nice
40,"This was my first time at the Mirage as we normally stay ""midstrip"" when we visit. Booked a Stay Well room on the 12th floor as the amenities listed seemed cool. There are 6 main differences; air purifier asents scent machine dawn light alarm circadian lighting system shower infuser and stay well mattress. Really enjoyed the air purifier and lighting system. Deepak Chopra meditation was also advertised but I never found it on any of the TV stations.    I did experience a mishap with housekeeping when I stayed but Jen at the front desk was quick to address it. Ordered food twice from the Pantry Restaurant and both times it was delicious. Also attended the Beatles Love Cirque du Soleil show and it was very good.    One recommendation I would have for the hotel would be to place better bathroom amenities in the Stay Well rooms. The ones in there are harsh and don't fit the theme/purpose of the room. If this cant be done then maybe upgraded bathroom amenities can be added to the minibar/purchase options? I would think an energizing option with a citrus or lemongrass scent and/or a lavender option to relax would sell well.    Overall I enjoyed the room location and hotel and would consider it again for a future stay."
40,Earned comped stay via popslots/mlife. The room was much nicer than we expected. The buffet was not stellar but it was 2 for 1 and worth the $34. We found some of the table minimums to be a bit high but that's just cause we don't like to bet high.
50,Our room was ready even though we arrived early. Clean and comfy. Food choices in the hotel are second to none! Had the best meal at the Carnegie Deli and a delicious shake and burger at LVB. Shows are magnificent!
40,Stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel is older strip location but the bathrooms appear to be upgraded and nice. The pool area was tropical resort feeling and quiet. Good drink service at the pool and around the casino. The dealers that I experienced were engaged and fun. There is a good breakfast restaurant right at elevator landing. Overall very clean and typical MGM resort. Good experience and well run.
40,Loved my stay at the Mirage. The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating going out of their way to provide me a room for an extra night after my flight home was cancelled. While not as fancy as Ceasar's or the Belaggio I found it to be much more affordable both in terms of room rates and the costs at some tables.    Next door to Ceasar's. Across the street from Harrah's. A block or so down the road from the historic Flamingo.    As is always the case in Vegas the dining options inside the hotel are rather expensive but tasty. Lively casino and a nice selection of shops.    A word of caution: with twice-nightly eruptions the volcano might keep you up if your room is on the wrong (or correct depending on your POV) side of the hotel.    My only complaint was that not all rooms have convenient power outlets next to the bed. Mine was one of these. There were plenty elsewhere around the room but none close to the bed. Fortunately I had an extension cord and could plug in my phone/tablet and work/surf in bed. Some rooms had newer alarm clocks which featured power USB ports in the back mine was not one. So if that might be an issue be sure and ask ahead of time.
50,The Sports Bar has the best staff ever. Long timers Pam Arturo Jimmy and Arnold great conversation! They are the best! The housekeeping staff is awesome too! Best location on the Strip! However one thing I wish they would quit doing is removing the awesome restaurants.
50,Classic Vegas hotel that exudes class and is constantly changing to stay up with the times!! Lots of good choices for restaurants the best selection of slots/video poker on the strip and plenty of table games to choose from.
40,We enjoyed the hotel and the eateries and bars within casino does smell like  Smoke though. Rooms were  Clean no prongs for the ice bucket had to Scoop ice out with another cup. The items in the fridge are outrageously priced a bit of gouging going on there.
50,I love staying at The Mirage. The rooms are nice and the bed is very comfortable. Choices of food is very good. The Love show is worth it. Location is perfect for walking the strip. Recommend it to anyone
20,Pro  The bed was very comfortable    Cons  1. Our room was not properly cleaned. We found a half eaten jar of Planters peanuts behind the nightstand while my husband was looking for an outlet to plug in his phone.  2. The sink in the bathroom was clogged and the water kept backing up. Similarly the toilet was frequently running and would require waiting several minutes between flushes.  3. I was disappointed to see that there was no refrigerator in the room and that we would need to spend $35 per day to rent one.  4. The timing of the welfare checks. We hoped to sleep in on our vacation but on our third day we received a welfare check at 10:00am. The very next day at 9:05am we were woken up by yet another welfare check. I don't understand why someone had to come by on consecutive days and why it could not have waited until an appropriate hour such as the afternoon.
20,Horrible customer service. they let me leave that hotel unsatisfied and no member of management even cared about my concerns. Her name was Suzie or something like that with an Asian decent. The way she did me and my wife was embarassing
40,I’ve stayed at the Mirage many times ... love the casino and pool although they did close the pool on the Monday when I was there... but they did send us to another pool! Overall it was a great stay !
50,"From the airport to check in at the Mirage to our very last day we experienced the most pleasant helpful and accomodating employees that we have ever encountered in our 30 years of travelling. Jenny at the front desk ""Rex"" at concierge Chad at Valet Jaxx and Jill at the pool bar..OUTSTANDING! We sincerely felt like we were at home and not just guests. The employees have respect to accomodate any situation. We experienced nothing but an excellent stay overall and cannot wait to return!"
50,This trip was a quick getaway with the girls. We loved staying at the Mirage because of the location it’s right in the middle of the strip. The customer service is excellent as well. I’ll be back soon and I will stay at the Mirage
50,"Have stayed at various hotels in Vegas but The Mirage is my favourite by far. Big enough yet not overwhelming. Location good. Very clean. Great service. Rooms lovely. No complaints. The Mirage is now my new ""temporary home"" of choice in Vegas!"
30,My husband and I were in Vegas for the first time ever. Choose the mirage. Well for the money you would think the rooms would be a little cleaner . Next time we go for our business trip we will stay elsewhere.
30,Stayed from Nov 9-13 the weather was great for being from Canada.  The room was ok (needs upgrading especially in the washrooms and toilet paper).We went to the pool area and it was beautiful but heard it was closing this weekend) so we went to the concierge and asked and he said pools were open 365 days a week ( no signs posted anywhere about closing).We went down Monday and the big pool was closed to our surprise and signs to another pool.  As we get to the area it’s a very small area everyone packed like a can of sardinesno seats and told they’ve been monitoring chairs every hours for people not being there.About 20 minutes later we found a bed and a couple tells us no one has been there for an hour so we move the towel and had been there an hour when 1 guy shows up and starts arguing with my wifeshe told him to talk to the staff.we ended up staying but it could’ve been avoided.  One last complaint and trust me I rarely complain about anything cause it’s not like me.  I like playing poker so on Tuesday night I sit down to play (I played every night) and we have a dealer and her time came up and she left so about an hour later she comes back to the table dressed in street clothes and sits down to play.That to me and a few other out it town players seemed a little weird and should not be allowed (conflict and your coworkers dealing)  Sorry and thanks.
50,"Mirrage is an excellent place to stay. One need not leave the property - I didn't and found plenty to do: relaxing by the pool checking out the shops and enjoying the entertainment Cirque's Beatle's ""LOVE"" show. There are many restaurants as well as a buffett. The restaurants are expensive but the buffet is reasonable.    I suggest staying in the ""tower"" as the elevators only operate with the insertion of the room key; a bit more security. The regular floors do not seem to have security - anyone can access the elevators"
50,We stayed in a two bedroom suite on the strip one looking the volcano which was very nice. It was very spacious for the four of us. We saw the Terry Fator show and it was a new act an a pleasure to watch. We had a great time and will go back to the Mirage again.
30,The Mirage was clean and our Stay Well room was comfortable enough. The towels were poor quality the toiletries sub-par and the toilet paper was bargain basement at best. The mini bar and the snacks above it are weight-sensored so the minute you pick something up its charged to your room and at $18 per bottle of water you want to be sure you aren't getting charged for something you didn't use. Yes EIGHTEEN dollars for a freakin' bottle of water. In their on-site convenience shops you'll pay less but a still ridiculous amount. 20oz sodas were $5.50 each in there. Walgreens is across the street at least and they charged half that. The Cravings brunch buffet was decent enough. Dinner at their Heritage steakhouse was tasty but not worth their exorbitant prices. Steaks do not come with any sides. The gambling tables are on the steeper side - $15 minimum at Roulette and cocktail waitresses are scarce. Gambling was much more fun across the street at Casino Royale.
50,Great overall gaming area clean room was well kept and comfortable bed a great area to walk around and explore. Top five pool but it does close for maintenance. Best to inquire beforehand. I would visit this property again.
40,Hotel has been renovated and very clean. The rooms are average. You can take the tram to treasure Island or cross the street at the lights without haveing to walk down the strip to a pedrestian overpass. The bar service whike playing slots mid week was horrible but very good on the weekend. I would stay there again but pay for a room upgrade.
10,Too much money compared to other places - they don't have many reel type slots - the resturants are greasy and way overpriced compared to other places.I've stayed there for 18 years but I'm looking around now - not going back.
50,We love going and staying at the Mirage at least 3 or 4 times each year. We usually go twice a year for business and twice a year for vacation. Some of the rooms are starting to date a little bit but they are still kept very clean and nice. We love seeing the Beatles Love show each time we stay and also think the Pantry is the best place to eat.
50,Have stayed at the Mirage before but not in about 10 years. Was a little worried leading up to trip after reading some negative reviews about the quality of the Mirage. Read many reviews starting the hotel was dirty unkempt smelly rooms and poor customer service. And I’m officially hear to say: don’t buy into the negative reviews.    If you are looking for ultra swanky new Las Vegas sophistication the mirage isn’t for you. Being an older hotel it doesn’t compare to the style of places like Aria Cosmopolitan or the Wynn. But neither does the price to stay. The Mirage is a super affordable experience and have me and my wife everything we needed.    We stayed in a Tower King Room (upgraded for a small fee) on the 24th floor. Our room was right next to the elevators and the ice machine. Previous reviewers stated how loud it is on the guest floors and I figured we were in for a loud 3 nights based off our rooms locations. But to my surprise it was absolutely fine. Like any hotel you hear people walking by your room or doors slamming. But we slept great and were not disturbed once. The bed was comfortable and room very spacious. The bathroom was larger due to the Tower King upgrade and included dual vanities and separate soaking tub and shower. Large flat screen TV in the room and a nice desk area. Lots of open floor space in our room. I will say that other reviewers are correct in saying that it’s kind of crazy that there are only two power outlets in the room (other than the bathroom) for charging devices. Room was totally clean and didn’t smell bad at all. We had a Mountain View which was pretty but I would have preferred a strip view.    There are many food options in the hotel with typical Vegas prices. We went to the buffet for breakfast once and it was totally adequate. Good food and a fair price of $20 per person. We had a 2 for 1 through the MyVEGAS app so it was totally worth it. Side note: if you’re not using the MyVEGAS app you definitely should. You get free stuff for just playing online slots or blackjack. On this trip alone we got two separate 2 for 1 buffets (Breakfast at Mirage & Dinner at Aria) and free cheese cake at Carnegie deli. Lots of great rewards so check it out.    My only complaint about our stay was the pool. I booked the Mirage mainly because I love the pool area and it’s opened/heated year round. On our first day we enjoyed the pool for a couple of hours. Temperature in the pool was great. Very warm which my wife loved. Was disappointed to see the main waterfall not operational but not a big deal. Now day 2 at the pool was a different story. Show up to swim around 1pm only to find that the pool is now CLOSED for 10 weeks of maintenance. This was not advertised anywhere on the website and no notification was sent out to guests. I understand the need for maintenance but this information should be made public way in advance. Because pool was closed the hotel opened up the adults only pool Bare for general use. Well it’s a very very small pool and lounge area. The wife and I proceeded to Bare to find it completely full. Not a free chair or sitting area in sight and the pool was completely full. I was not happy about this so I proceeded straight to the front desk to voice my frustration. The clerk at the desk couldn’t have been easier to work with and understood my frustration. He immediately waived the restore fees for all 3 nights ( a savings of $125). Then his manage came over and offered me and my wife a free days admission to the spa ($60 value). Additionally the hotel was allowing guests to utilize the pools at other MGM resorts such as Mandalay Bay Luxor and MGM Grand. Didn’t have to be pushy with the staff at all about any of this. They were very accommodating. My wife and I did end up going to the pool at Mandalay Bay. They have many pools over there including a wave pool and lazy river) but most were closed for the season. The two that were open were small and completely different in temperatures. The beach club pool was cold so nobody other than me was in it which wasn’t bad. The lower level pool was literally hot. Like hot tub temperature. So few people were in that one either. We appreciated the free spa passes though as we got to spend time the next day relaxing and using the hot tubs steam rooms and saunas.    The location of the Mirage is great too! It’s  Near a lot of the other big hotels shopping dining and we appreciated the Walgreens right across the street. We aren’t huge gamblers but the casino was just fine for us. Lots of games and steady flow of free drinks.    Again I don’t understand how so many people seem to have issues with the Mirage. I understand that some people just have less than stellar experiences but I also think a lot of people just have too high of expectations. If you’re looking for a good hotel to stay at that offers a good Las Vegas experience but doesn’t break the bank The Mirage is perfect. If you want Uber-swanky high class Vegas consider some place else. But be prepared to pay 3-4 times more per night.    I will absolutely consider staying at the Mirage again because the experience you get is totally worth the cost.
20,"I wish I could give a better review. We stayed here last year for SEMA and LOVED it. So we chose to stay here again this year. We have had reservations for months. Upon check in which was late arrival time no rooms were available. After the desk staff calling someone a few times they said the good news we got a suite that night bad news we would move tomorrow. Ok whatever thats fine. So at 8am the next morning we go down to verify the move yes you need to move you have till 11 to get out of your room your new room isnt ready yet. So we go to breakfast and then head up to pack. Find our keys no longer work with all of our stuff in it. This was only like 9am. We had to go back down to the desk they had to reactivate our key room was still not ready they comped our breakfast as a peace offering gave us keys so ""we didnt have to come back to the desk again"" and would text when our room was ready and what number it was. We had to leave all our stuff with the Bell Hop desk and head over to SEMA. All day long no texts of having a room ready. Finally after a long day we end up back at the desk again at 5:30 had to wait in a ridiculously long line again to finally get told our room was ready. We basically felt homeless in Las Vegas for a day. Paid for a room from Wednesday to Sunday and really had no access to one until Thursday night. It was ridiculous trying to attend a trade show carry stuff around all day with us have no access to our other stuff at the Bell Hop and no place to rest or refresh ourselves after walking 1000 miles around SEMA. Not to mention it cost us more money as we had to use the Bell service and tip the guy who finally brought us our bags. There was little compensation for this issue. As for the rest of the hotel room was fine once we finally got one! The Pantry and LVB Burger were great the Buffet wasnt too bad either. The casino is clean layout is good we enjoy this casino except for the room issue. Slots were crazy tight this time frame we were there. I expect a casino to be on the winning side of my $100 bill but Its a lot more fun when it takes me an hour to lose it than five minutes. We had a better time with the slots at Treasure Island. Also.. one note I saw a review about the Toilet. Dude you were not the only one. Our Toilet had to flush multiple times and hold the handle five minutes to work. If it wasn't for the room issue we would have rated this MUCH higher."
50,I have nothing bad to say about this hotel! Staff was very accommodating and friendly. Food was delicious in the buffet and the Still restaurant. Pool Jacuzzi and guest rooms were clean. Location is pretty central on the strip. Free tram to TI is nice. Would definitely stay again!
20,I felt it was bait and switch tactic. Didn’t get our king room that was reserved and then got a $200 resort fee that was never presented. Staff at check in really didn’t care that we didn’t get our king room and said they were all given away. Gave us the same coupons that they give everyone at check in (ps...the free Uber one doesn’t work). I’ve stayed at Holiday Inn Expresses more clean and friendly than this world class resort.
10,I loved the mirage until my most recent stay was no different from my last stay. The toilet in my room would not flush properly and because the manor as not dealt with in adequate amount of time it became an embarassing situation. The end result was being told the toilet is leaking and that I need to wait 45 seconds to flush a 2nd and 3rd time. A good hotel makes their guest as comfortable as posssible during their stay away from home. I could not wait to leave.
10,We planned a pleasurable weekend to celebrate a birthday. I arrive to our two bedroom suite hours after my sister with whom we are sharing accomodations. The Mirage refuses to allow entry to the suite for my sister and her husband and suggested that they book yet another room if they ned access prior to my arrival. I've stayed at hundreds of hotels and we are paying dearly for this celebration weekend - wish we had not chosen the Mirage as they are proving inflexible and unreasonable.
50,This is one of my favorite hotels that I loved going in to the lobby.  This hotel has a big casino with all kinds of games.  They have a lot of shops.  They have a dolphin and tiger exhibit that is really cool.
50,Will only stay at Mirage. Great central location clean friendly and value. Buffet at Cravings was classic and innovative at same time. Extreme helpfulness from staff. Room impeccably clean and arranged.
40,Love it for location and there are great restaurants and bars within. Rum bar without patio is awesome. Great pool as well. Casino ready for a refresh and payouts seemed very poor. Had more fun at other casinos.  Rooms typical hotel rooms. Nothing special. But very comfy beds. Which is almost most important. Rooms showing their age and time for Reno’s esp in washroom.  Weird policy that anything you touch on minibar automatically charged for. Should change that.  Be nice to have a fridge and not have to pay for it.  Checkin slow and chaotic. Also needs improvement.
20,MGM Resorts ought to be ashamed of themselves fir allowing this once great property to fall into mediocrity. Hotel room dated and beaten up light fixtures in room not working rude staff. So disappointed
30,My husband requested a fan for our room months in advance was told he’d have one but upon arrival none available. He asked again upon arrival but told no. All our bathroom drains were clogged slow draining.
50,Hotel nice and clean rooms a good size with a shower and small bath in a excellent location on the strip nice casino. Staff friendly and some good eating places in the hotel. It is a big hotel but easy to navigate around
40,I stayed at The Mirage nov 1st- nov 4th. Had a very good stay but was placed at the end of one of the hallways. I suggest requesting a room halfway down the hallway to be not as close to the elevator but also not a mile away!    The room was nice but could have been a little fancier. Had a great view of the mountains which was awesome. And the bed was the MOST comfortable hotel bed I’ve EVER stayed in.    No instructions or price list for minibar/snacks. The snack bag I grabbed cost 15$ eventually. I knew it’d be expensive so not complaining there.    Great location!!!! Would stay their again!
40,We stayed multiple time usually at the south end of the strip as we spend most of our time on MGM properties.  Checkin was fast - dedicated line for Gold and higher members.  Room clean but definitely smaller compare with Aria or Park rooms we stayed this year.  Like pool - plenty beds. Unfortunately it was cold weekend and we didn't have a chance to relax under the sun.  For Mlife member -not all merchants are part of the resort and you may not get your point from purchases
20,it's a casino with a hotel rather than a hotel with a casino. There is no coffee service in the room which makes morning's rather difficult. No use of the refrigerator in the room unless you pay $50. Ridiculous
50,Great property if you want to be close to everything on the strip. Friendly staff decent rooms and a nice Casino layout. Good restaurants and bars. We will likely stay again sometime very soon. Highly recommend.
50,We were very pleased with our stay at the Mirage. The one out standing part of our stay was our housekeeper. She greeted us each day as if we were old friends. It was a great vacation with friends to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary.
50,We had a great time at the Mirage for a 1 week getaway. We had no issues with any staff or amenities.    Check in:    Check in was a breeze. We were checking in for 2 rooms at once and wanted to coordinate as best as possible. The front desk staff was wonderful and friendly. She was able to accommodate our requests and worked hard to help us. We had booked 2 King rooms but when we arrived they only had Queen rooms left. Without prompting they waived our resort fees and we felt this went a long way to resolving the situation.    The Room:    The room was well appointed and large. There is no usable fridge in the room as the one that is there is full of beverages (for added cost). As such we had to rely on the ice machine more than we wanted. The bed was very comfortable (stiff).    The Casino:    The casino is large and has a drink ticket system that is different than other hotels on the strip. As a result of this policy we did not gamble here and instead went to other Casinos on the strip.    The Location:    The Mirage is one of the most northern casinos on the strip so most of the time there is a long walk involved in getting around. This did not bother us but it could be an issue for those who want to be right in the action. There are plenty of options for food and entertainment around the Mirage.    The Pool:    The pool is reason enough to stay here. It was amazing. Huge with large waterfalls. The only downside is that the loungers are so stuffed together that it gets crowded. It is also impossible to find loungers that are free if you arrive anytime after first opening.    We ordered reserved loungers for $50 per chair. These were amazing and it was nice to know that we would not lose access for the day we were there.    Shows:    We took advantage of the room discount for The Beetles Love. It was amazing and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.    Overall impression: We would stay here again. The only real negative was the crowded pool but the Pool itself made up for this. We really enjoyed our stay!
50,Never any disappointment with our stay at the mirage. the staff is always friendly and courteous. Our check in process through the mobile desk was easy and stress free. Housekeeping always greeted us in the hallways and asked if we needed anything
10,Disgusting clumps of women’s hair in the shower when I checked it. Maid cleaned the room twice missed it twice. Key didn’t work at times. Had to wait in line to get the problems resolved. Awesome way to spend a hangover. Cmon Mirage.
30,I first came to The Mirage Hotel in 1991 when it was new and really cool. This was in the day if cheap rooms for all in Vegas. FAST FORWARD .......everyone is almost 30 years older. I checked in to The Mirage on Friday 11-1. Used to be if you were polite and asked nicely you could get in your room early. Well there’s a new game in town that disrespects the loyal customers who return. Its’ called “ Nickel and Dime them to Death” every chance you can. When I got to my room that at 1:30 pm it cost 50 bucks for early check in. The temperature in the room was 78 and though I set the thermostat to 65 it never got below 72 and i was there for four days. The fan in the very small bathroom made good noise but little else. I was constantly reminding my little brother  my room mate who is 61 years old “ Mike please close the bathroom door every time  Use the bathroom.” The four once package of Cashews i ate work out to be $72.00 a pound. What the heck has happened to real service and real hospitality. The total stay was almost $ 1000.00 I’ll try to avoid it in the future. ALSO PLEASE DON’T BOTHER SENDING ME ANY LIP SERVICE ABOUT HOW “YOUR SORRY THAT....MY STAY WAS .....” That will only make me vomit................and i’d Be sending the bill to The Mirage. It’s like a beautiful woman I once knew who now has Leprosy . J3
50,I visited Las Vegas for the first time for my birthday staff was helpful rooms were clean and the location is great right in the middle of the strip. The inside casino is great u really never have to leave the hotel good food variety of restaurants even had a tattoo parlor great experience overall!
50,Quick check in. Easy to find elevators and room. Room was very clean and spacious. Bathroom was a little small but it was nice. Room service was pricey but prompt. Housekeeping did a great job!! Love the atmosphere of this hotel! Looking forward to staying again!!
40,This is my third time staying at the Mirage as I have stayed at most of the better hotels on the strip and would recommend the Mirage as it is on center of the strip so there is less walking to do. The room was very large but I had a terrible view from the second floor. I play alot of blackjack but was extremely disappointed in so many tables were paying 6.5 on blackjack which is a terrible rule for the players. Two fantastic shows in Love and Terry Frator. The LVB Burgers and the Deli had reasonble prices to eat. The lunch buffet was fairly reasonable only for lunch on weekdays.Service was excellent.
30,Our room was looking a bit tired. I understand they are renovating. Bed was very comfortable. Was not crazy that we had to walk all the way through the casino to get to the room elevators. The pool is great not sure if I would bring children though.
40,Suites were nice but dated.  Deli was awesome.  Video poker machines fine but need better pay tables.  Sports book great but crowded.  Otoro restaurant very good- great sushi.  Cravings buffet was average at best.  VIP services top notch! Francis Rivera- the best host hands down.
10,I booked through myVEGAS. Some issue happened where they only made a reservation for one night instead of two. I called them and they rectified this immediately and apologized profusely. It was initially their error. I checked w the front desk after speaking to MyVEGAS and the mirage confirmed it was now all good to go and no issues would arise. Stated they made notes on the room. When checking out the mirage charged for the room. They said MyVEGAS was the issue and didn’t do what I asked. I explained the woman I worked with at the front desk made notes about this because I did have to spend my time taking care of this before. They said there were no notes and I’d have to call MyVEGAS again. It took about an hour to get through and when speaking to MyVEGAS they explained that it was good in their side called the front desk on my behalf and said there was no reason they didn’t just use a code they share to get this taken care of. When I went back down to the front desk they laughed at me when I told them what myvegas said and didn’t even apologize for the inconvenience of missing a lunch reservation and having to stay to figure this out again. Was really upset.
30,We spent 5 days at the Mirage and found it to be over priced for what you got. For example the water in your room will cost you $17.00. Sensors detect movement so don’t even touch it.. including the bar fridge. Everything’s crazy expensive including all the restaurants. Unlike other hotels snacks like pizza by the slice is unavailable. You must sit down and pay thru the nose at every restaurant. Not only the Hotel gouge you for everything the rooms are also dated... very disappointed... I know Vegas is overall expensive but this place took the cake for what you got...We will not be back...
20,Ouch. On top of the not cheap room rate you get to pay an additional 'resort tax' of $37 per night (allegedly to use the gym). This is mandatory gym use or not ... Want a bottle of water from the mini bar? $18 please and not even chilled. Tiny travel size toothpaste? $12 from the 'convenience store'. So as long as you don't mind being ripped off and enjoying the 10 minute walk to your room past people smoking and pumping coins into gambling terminals day and night you'll have a great time.
20,I travel to Las Vegas frequently. Over the years I have loved the Mirage. My love is gone I feel like this is a sad breakup. We often stay at the Mirage about 1/3 of the time. (I come with my husband every three weeks for a romantic weekend away friends other couples.) My last visit to the Mirage was last weekend (Thursday through Monday) and I was once again disappointed. We were staying at another hotel but came to the Mirage twice onceto have dinner at Tom Collicchio's steak house at the Mirage and another night to go to the Matt Goss show (Fourth time highly recommended). At the steak house Anthony was our server. He. Is. Phenomenal. Ask to be seated in his section you won't be disappointed. We brought in a special bottle of wine and the sommelier (Larry?) was fantastic. He took the extra time to talk about the wine with us and we had a great time and an incredible meal there We like the central strip location of the Mirage and the casino as it is not too big it is easy to get to the guestrooms from the casino and the restaurants for the most part are very good. The staff in the past have all been kind friendly helpful with directions and genuinely make sure that we want to come back to the Mirage even when we are not staying there We have noticed a gentle decline but in the past few months it has dropped like a rock. When I am gambling i do enjoy an adult beverage. Or two. However when I am sitting with friends for 90 minutes and no cocktail waitress comes around it does not make me want to come back. When the waitress (Tina?) finally arrived she was rude and condescending to me and more importantly to my friends I was there with. I do not appreciate an audible eye roll when I ask for a bottle of water with my drink and the heavy sigh to go along with it. I tipped her well and after 40 minutes she never came back. So we went to the show. After the show we went to gamble more and the waitress (Stacey?) was funny nice and attentive. Made me feel welcome. She said that it would be a few minutes to get our drinks to us she would be right back. And she was. I am just not feeling the love from the Mirage.( Other than the matzo ball soup at the Carnegie Deli that is a bowl of grandmas love. The best. Ever.) I understand that there are cost cutting measures but the lack of higher end alcoholic beverages and over rushed staff in the casino makes me feel less apt to come back. I rotate my stays between the Palazzo the Cosmo the Delano and the Mirage. I think that my time staying and gambling the Mirage is done.
10,This was our first time to Las Vegas. We purchased the buffet package where we received two buffets each day. We were there for 2 nights and 3 days (10/30-11/1). We ate at the buffet on 10/31 and right before we checked out on 11/1. We were charged for the second buffet because it was done on the day of checkout. I specifically asked the customer service representative how the free buffets worked and she not once told me it could not be done on the day we checked out. I called the hotel after we got our statement and was told that nothing could be done because it was written on the vouchers. I unfortunately did not see that part because when I asked the lady who checked us in how it worked I thought she had given us all the information we needed for them. I am extremely frustrated that this error is non refundable since we purchased the free buffet package.
50,Very good buffet. Lovely decor. Nice shopping. What more can I say ? I was there when it all begun. It was magical. The mermaid look like me. The sandwiches are stacked MIGHTY high ... can you finish it ? Play some more ... I can't get enough slots. Gotta win bigtime you know. Let me just say this  The Mirage was just the beginning of what's to come and boy did they started coming ... building all those hotel casinos and resorts PLUS golf courses and housing development. Wow Vegas ! Look what you've become. Maria G. Christa
50,Fabulous strip view! Great food/bar’s! Stayed 3 nights and had an amazing time. Ate at three different place there at the Mirage and enjoyed All three. Spent a lot of tine at the Rhume Bar at night and it was amazing.
40,Hotel was lovely we had a 2 x queen room with strip view. Beds very comfortable bathroom very small with pretty rubbish shower and no coffee machine which was a nuisance when attending business conference so was up  Early. No complaints about the hotel as first time in Vegas I didn’t know what to expect. The tigers in the zoo were pacing and this was awful to see but apart from them great hotel!
20,Didn't have the room we reserved made reservation in July had to switch rooms the next day which was a waste of our vacation time. Our friends got comp 2 nights resort fees we only got one. Drinks are ridiculously price in the bar area!
40,Very nice hotel clean with helpful staff. Centrally located on the strip  Nice pool very attentive staff at the pool bar.    A few complaints I requested a fridge for my medication and water I have MS I was told I would have to pay $35 a day for the fridge. I have never had to pay for a fridge for my medication before!  There is a secret garden and dolphin abitat at the hotel I think you should be allowed to go into this area once if you are staying at the hotel.  I was also disappointed that there was no coffee making facilities in the room thank goodness I took my travel kettle 😁
10,There is no coffee maker in the room! Even low end hotels offer this feature. I’m here on business and had a 5 am conference call due to time zone differences and it was extremely surprising and disappointing to realize the room did not have a coffee maker. There is also no complimentary bottle of water in the room.
50,This hotel is in the middle of the strip centrally located. They have great rooms great restaurants great gambling and is beautifully designed and decorated. Everyone is friendly and helpful too. I will definitely stay here again.
50,Excellent service the staff was very tentative. The food for the conference was AMAZING! Bar service at the sports bar was very tentative. Very clean didn't smell of smoke even though people were smoking.
40,The atmosphere at Mirage is lovely. From the very friendly staff the bright and airy lobby and entrance good selection of restaurants and entertainment the beautiful swimming pool areas and of course the beautiful aroma that's pumped in. We've been to Las Vegas almost 20 times and finally made it to the Mirage on our June 2019 visit. We returned and stayed again in Oct 2019 and will definitely be back!    Only suggestion would be to serve your guests coffee/tea in the buffet rather than having them get up to serve themselves.
20,Not told until end of stay front desk wouldve given vouchers to cover exorbitant parking charges also ordered room svc breakfast waited 1.5 hrs only brought coffee didnt bring food I called and waited another 45 minutes for food plus sportsbook TVs are from the 1980s not good enough for the Vegas strip
10,Rooms are confortable enough but staff is really rude. They will also boast that resort fees give you ... Free internet??? Seriously? 44 dollars per day for free internet? watch out for all hidden extras like free parking which is actually free only to VIP.. Plus they keep dolphins... How outdated and cruel? The pool is lovely but full of drunks and their drinks. shame.
30,The Mirage is a nice hotel and the casino is good except more smokey than others we were in. But I would highly discourage you from eating at the Buffet at the Mirage - it was the worst food I've ever had at a buffet - expensive and disappointing.
10,The room was really worn down. The head hard fabric was torn and the shower drain was rusty. For a place charging $8 for a coke at the pool it should be nicer. I won’t be back to this hotel for a stay.
20,The Mirage is showing it’s age especially in the design of the property: Low ceilings poor lighting small cramped rooms and an overwhelming smell of cigarette smoke everywhere. We booked a tower king and the room was smaller than expected. The separate shower was useless because the shower head was pointed horizontally and wouldn’t move down. The water literally sprayed in my face and over my wife’s head. Reported this on 3 separate occasions and nothing was done about it.    Beds are quite firm and the sheets are terrible quality. The AC was a pain as it was either freezing or hot. Finally the lights on the exterior of the building shine at the windows at night making the entire room glow with the shades closed.    There’s so many other nicer properties on the strip that I can’t believe the Mirage is still able to compete. Cesars next door had a great casino and the Linq’s casino across the street was so much cleaner and almost no smell of smoke. We won’t return to the Mirage.
30,Regular experience. Bad sleeping experience. Bad beds with horrible arangement of sheets and pillows. Service at restaurants bad. Great location. Pool ours dont allow for swiming in the evening. Overall just ok.
30,Nice hotel  Guest services for check in should have new guests offered services to take them to their rooms in this large Hotel  Worse evil here is the Smoking in the Hotel  This is nearly 2020..NO Smoking for All Public Places Is A Necessity  There are children and families here.  Stop the Smoking Indoors  There is a charge of $8 on ATMs in Hotel plus Canadians don’t change your money here $26 dollar surcharge as well as the Regular conversion for the day and the extra is in US funds  Go to another Hotel would be my advice
40,Went on a vacation with my spouse. Overall it was a great experience. The housekeeping stafff was amazing and friendly. The only thing is the rooms need some updating. Other than that check in was great and the casino was fun. Overall I would stay there again.
10,"Valet is not properly staffed room wasn't ready until almost 2 hours check in. There are numerous offers available for to the ""resort fee"" yet you get nothing. As a pearl card holder as well as a local you're tasted worse than a tourist. If you love here just Uber."
20,The room was simply not up to standards in terms of cleanliness. The staff did not vacuum every day there was splatter on the console and fridge and rust stains in the bathtub under the faucet. Overall I was not thrilled with the cleanliness for the price I was paying. The staff is very nice and the location is extremely convenient especially for conferences.
30,The bathroom needed a renovation the water was scalding hot or cold with no in between. My wife and I were tripping over each other while getting ready to go out so she could use the mirror with light. The tv was not intuitive to use and the checkout was horrible as no details were displayed so we had to go to the lobby where the machine times out making us stand in line for the front desk as well. I will be staying elsewhere on my next trip.
30,A little to fast track. The reward program was not explained. Breakfast was a joke the lines were long and you had to get up at 5 in order to be able to eat breakfast before the conference. The location was great. What staff I had contact with were friendly.
30,It has been several years since my wife and I have been in Las Vegas. In past years we always stayed at the Mirage. We liked the hotel the restaurants the shows and the casino even though we are not gamblers. We also liked the location next to the forum shops and close to other places we like such as the Venetian. The years have not been good to the Mirage. The walk to the elevators through the casino is very unpleasant due to the cigarette smoke. Smoking is banned in most public places in the country but not in Vegas Casinos I guess because their customers like to smoke. We are both very sensitive to cigarette smoke and we were not able to spend any time in the casino. We attended a concert at the Venetian and spent some time (and money) in the casino and did not were not bothered by smoke. As to the hotel the rooms are small and need updating. The pillows are terrible and they did not have feather pillows.  The bathroom was unacceptable. The plumbing fixtures don't appear that they have ever been replaced and the water pressure in the shower is so intense my wife could not stand in it. Maybe we are getting to old for Vegas but if we go back we will no longer stay at the Mirage and will probably stay off the strip at a Marriott. You just hate to see it.
40,The stay was fine. Everybody and the amenities were good. The problem i have is with your customer service line. It is a joke. i get an email that gives me a number and tells me there will be someone happy to talk with me. the truth is its just a recoerding and there no help.
40,- The pool are is awesome 'cause it is probably on of the few hotels having lots of palms.  - Location is the best since it is directly in the middle of the strip.  - Our room was nice - only the door could not be closed 100% therefore it could be noisy for someone.  - Restaurant service was also good. The only issue we had was check-out - we were charged USD 200 with no reason. Solving this error took me 30 Min.
50,This was a very pleasing stay. Friendly check-in staff also line moved fast. I would recommend people come stay here. The hotel has lots of beautiful waterfalls and plants located inside the hotel. We look forward to next time stays here.
40,The hotel is nice and modern. It has a good location on the strip. The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. It is a bit on the expensive side but that is normal for Las Vegas. The only downside was the line to check in I had to wait almost 40 minutes in line just to check in. The restaurants are not good I got physically ill after eating one of their meals however that the hotel itself is really good. I would stay here again.
40,We stayed 2 nights and enjoyed it. Arriving off a 11 hour flight we wre glad there were no queues ar reception at 9pm but noticed that during the day the lines were pretty long.    It's a long walk to your room from reception but - of course - the hotel wants you to walk through the casino and have a little flutter. The rooms are nice although our bathroom seemed a bit dated. There are plenty places to eat which naturally given the size of the hotel pretty busy for breakfast. The waits ere never more than 20 minutes though.    Would I stay there again? Probably although there are so many other interesting hotels to choose from on the Strip then maybe not.
50,Beautiful property with a great staff. Would return (and probably will) and definitely recommend to others. Location is a easy walk to other locations and events but really you could never leave the hotel and still have everything you need in one place!
50,Great hotel! Great location! Great casino! Great restaurants...the deli has the BEST pastrami sandwiches! The access to the room elevators/casino/ strip are very convenient unlike some hotels where there’s a huge distance between them. Always have a great experience at the mirage!
30,Vegas all depends on the deal when you book and we got a decent deal on this hotel. So it was okay for the value but I’ve stayed in better such as the MGM. In terms of location it is on the strip so if that’s your thing it’s a good location.
30,This place is in need of a face lift my room still has trash on the floor. The wall paper was peeling away from the baseboard about six inches up the wall. The water drains in the restroom were all rusty.
10,Outdated and dirty. Stuff was on the floor when I arrived. Toilet didn’t flush half the time. Moved the pillows on the bed and a mini dust bowl occurred in the room. Absolutely dissatisfied and won’t be returning.
50,Came to town for a night to see Boyz II Men. Checking in to this hotel was SUPER easy and quick thanks to mobile check in. We were even given the option to upgrade our room for a small fee and it was totally worth it. I loved that we didn't have to leave our casino to go watch Boyz II Men and we even had dinner here after the show. I would totally recommend this hotel. Only downside to this is that parking is extra on top of the $42 resort fee.
50,Truly amazing. Carl the Security Guard made my first day AMAZING. I loved the conversation and appreciate his approach to engaging the dialog. The food...let me tell you about the food...WOW! Reminder...drink lots of water. My activity tracker logged 42.4 miles in 5 days it's a beast to get around without being hydrated.
20,Although we were upgraded to a suite the room was not inexpensive and it did not include basic amenities such as a coffee maker or bathrobes. Having to go downstairs from the 22nd floor for coffee or having to purchase room service coffee for $15 was ridiculous. Even motels provide coffee. Additionally the walls are paper thin. We could hear even quiet conversations in the adjacent rooms not to mention the elevators running up and down all night long. Televisions that emerge from footboards aren't impressive when you've had a poor night's sleep and no morning coffee.
50,What a wonderful business trip I had with all the help from the Mirage staff and perfect accomondations. Anytime I had questions they would stop what they were doing and give me the help that was needed. Thanks go to you all for all you do.
10,My room was cleaned and my items were trashed prior to check-out. I lost 500 in expense reimbursement receipts and a pair of shoes. The manager offered no resolve said there was nothing he could do...was completely unapologetic and completely disregarded the issue. I will never stay here again!
30,This was my second stay at the Mirage and it really wasn't anything special. The rooms were fine and clean and well maintained check in and check out were easy so no issues there. The service was ok when you can get somebody they would be helpful. Next time I go back to Vegas I definately will be somewhere else there was just nothing that would make me come back to this property.
40,The rooms are clean and comfortable and our view was cool. The only thing I can complain about as far as the room goes is there are no outlets to charge your phone on your night stand (we were on floor 25). We didn’t interact with the desk staff as we did mobile check in. If the casino staff at least the bar tenders and waitresses in the casino were not the friendliest by far. I didn’t have a single waitress that was nice or that came back in a regular basis (I tip two dollars per drink or sometimes drink and a beer which we tip three dollars).. so I spent more time gambling at the a casino Royale because at least the waitresses I had there were friendly and actually came back.
40,Slot games too tight. Waitresses more worried about tips then patrons. No food available $15 which is important for a gambler. Watered down drinks. No sweet wines available. Not everyone drinks dry or semi dry wines.
50,The hotel was beautiful! We enjoyed the bars while on our visit. We also saw the volcano on our trip. It was wonderful! Music water explosions fire. You can feel the heat! The whole volcano experience is a pretty short amount of time but it’s worth the adventure
30,Great Location  very friendly staff clean and very nice rooms. I would have given The Mirage a 4.5 rating but had a rental car and was forced to pay $15 parking everyday very disappointing the other Casino's offer free parking.
50,What a great place to stay in Vegas. In the middle of everything and always easy access to all Vegas has to offer. The pool is absolutely freezing and very few people were in the water. The pool area is completely full with people but there is hardly any one in the actual pool...crazy strange! Great workout gym. Fun place to stay.
20,This resort is quite expensive for the guest perks. Guests deserve more if paying over $250 per night. There were not even coffee pots in the room. Silly. We would not stay here again unless the prices dropped significantly.
50,This was my first time staying at the Mirage in Vegas.4 day stay. The location is perfect for walking to shows and saving ride money. The box office staff is SUPERB!! Dustin is the man! Finding me great deals and GO SEE BEATLES LOVE! Best show on strip. Karen at the Rewards center was such a huge help. The Pantry for breakfast or late night snack food is excellent! Kudos to Tony and Marina for their fun conversation and great service. Thanks to Kyle for a fast checkout. Slots were loose all over too! Pool is awesome. Excellent place to stay!
50,"She's right one size does not fit all. The Mirage in my opinion falls into the just right category if you are looking for a hotel that is not so enormous that you lose your way. Yet is small eough to give you a feeling of intimacy.The choice of dining venues could be better and venues themselves were lacking in quality.  we found our room to be very clean (always) and all other amenities in place.  I would suggest that to get the best in ""extras"" that you join the MLife club. I recently attended an invitational Slot Club Tournament (via my membership) and had a whole lot of fun. Food and Drinks were great the staff wonderful. So I have to say a big shout out to the Special Events People. Great job!!!! What a wonderful crew."
50,I thoroughly enjoy my time at the Mirage. The staff from the top down were very accommodating. The Spa was amazing. And of course the volcano was fun! I recommend this as a place to stay in Las Vegas.
20,Wherever one goes in this hotel one must pass through a very smoky casino. Cigarette smoke hangs in the air. By the end of my stay my throat was sore and I awoke at night coughing. One cannot avoid it either. To the pool lobby outside restaurants.....through the smoky casino. Also BEWARE: The rate sounds reasonable until one realizes there's also a $37 resort fee per day PLUS $15 per day parking. It's very deceptive. They should just raise the daily rate for goodness sake! I'll not stay here again though it's a lovely hotel with a great location. Just not worth the unhealthy air and deceptively high fees.
50,We had been to a few casino on the strip the same night for gambling and this one was our favorite.    The dealers at our blackjack table were very professional and answered any questions we had in a nice manner. We were well taken care of for drinks by the cocktail waitresses!    The tables and the machines weren't too bad that night!    There's also a cool volcano show out front of the hotel.    We will be back!
10,Was treated like crap when we arrived. Room I paid extra for was not available as they overbooked. I would strongly recommend not stayin here. They really don’t care when you tell them about your issue.
30,I will stay elsewehere next time. I stayed here two years ago and I really liked it. This time it was not what I was expecting. The rooms are a bit dated pool staff don't care about their guests. It was very noisy after 12 am
50,I'm picky about beds and pillows and I was very comfortable. Needs more quick breakfast options. Signs are helpful on the casino floor. Friendly staff and spacious rooms. I've stayed multiple years and would stay again.
20,I arrived to dirty towels in the closet and no toiletries in the bathroom. I called housekeeping and they came and fixed it. The next day housekeeping overlooked trash on my floor (soap wrapper) and did not clean the counter. Day 3 I hung the privacy sign and opted out of cleaning altogether since all it did was frustrate me.
50,I attended a conference in Las Vegas for the first time. It was held at The Mirage and once I got over the bright lights and noise I enjoyed my stay. The check-in staff went out of their way to honor my reservation. My room was clean and spacious. The food was fine. The staff was especially friendly and helpful.
10,A pipe burst in a room next to mine causing a leak in my room. I was moved to a room with a horrible room and extremely loud neighbors. No one helped me move as promised and a 50 dollar lunch that was promised didn't cover a tip. Lunch was a waste of time and an ineffective way to satisfy my stay. My company covered my meals all week and I could have used that instead. I will not be staying at the Mirage again. Felt like a number there.
50,The hotel service and food were excellent. Location is great. Easy walking to other primary hotels and shopping. The Pantry (inside the Mirage) was an excellent eating spot. . . great food and excellent service. Hotel rooms were very comfortable and always clean.
50,Had so many things to offer even if your not staying there. Has the Dolphin and Lion education areas and explains a lot about the work they are doing. Has lovely Lobby very welcoming and looks like your in a rainforest
40,Make sure to get a Mlife card and check the special offers for room deals frequently they're are some great deals. Location on the strip is good close to other casinos and shopping. Best sportsbook in Las Vegas
40,I have stayed at the Mirage several times.  This most recent stay was enjoyable and I thought the rooms and facilities were very clean and nice HOWEVER there is one thing all future guests should be abundantly aware of. The food and water products in the rooms are ridiculously priced without any labels or price tags. If you remove any product the container which they are in detects its removal and charges you. I made the mistake of taking one bottle of water. Then out of curiosity I logged onto my account only to find out I just paid $18 for a liter of room temperature water. This is an abuse and the MGM policy on this should be required to be changed.  I spent a lot of money during my vegas visit but am only upset over this one $18 purchase.
10,Upon check-in: My colleague and I were notified that the rooms we had paid for were not available to us and due to this we were being upgraded to better rooms. What a wonderful surprise! We were thrilled!    Two days into our stay: We both received phone calls notifying us that due to a 'leak' in each of our rooms we would need to move to different rooms in the hotel. It's interesting that the same leak could affect both of us considering I was on the 8th floor and my colleague was on the 24th.    After the move: We were each placed into our new rooms and I decided to speak with the manager at the front desk. She informed me that I was lied to about the leak and that the hotel needed the upgraded rooms back. I understand that there might have been guests coming in that needed those specific rooms and would have understood if this had been communicated. Honesty is ALWAYS best. I do not appreciate being lied to.    After the stay: I was told that due to the inconvenience of moving half way through the trip and the subsequent lies from Mirage staff that I would be sent an email with a code for a future complimentary stay. I never received this email.    Overall: That's one upgrade one downgrade and two big lies.    Beware.
30,We’ve stayed in several hotels on the strip and really enjoyed the location of the Mirage. It’s very close to both the Forum Shops at Caesars and the Fashion Show Mall. It’s definitely not a luxurious hotel so if that’s a priority for you I’d suggest the Bellagio. Rooms are dated and our room had a gross musty smell and a clogged shower drain. There’s no coffee maker or fridge in the room which is common for Vegas but bothersome since we had to wait in line for 30 min. or more to get a coffee or pay $15 for the room service coffee. I suggest walking over to the Starbucks in the Caesars Forum shops entry instead. Most of the restaurants in the Mirage closed around 11:00 p.m. which we found odd especially for Vegas.
30,Nothing exciting but its well located and sometimes reasonable when compared to other rates nearby. The rooms and property are blah....average or slightly below from the old decor to the tiny TV. Not what one would imagine in flashy Vegas.
30,Poor start initially but corrected . Had issues with check in but were offered compensatory options then issues with the first room we checked into after a couple calls to front desk and then manager it was worked out sufficiency.
10,We rented a deluxe strip view. Our room was not a strip view we had a view of the air conditioners and partial pool view. The Mirage did nothing but take 2 night resort fees off and tell us our room was considered a strip view. Even though at check in we were told they didn’t have us in a strip view and I showed my confirmation. They were fully booked and made a mistake they did not want to own! Very upset!
10,They nickel and dime you on everything made me basically not want to spend anything on the casino because I had no money left after just trying to buy basic essentials. Nothing is done to make you feel like they care.
10,Grim experience. Will never go there again. Hard to sleep. (Noise from elevators and other guests was audible within room with insufficient sound insulation.) Lacked standard facilities like coffee maker in the room and bath robes.
20,Don't expect to get any meaningful rest on the bed you are paying a lot of money for. Its just not going to happen on the ones in the rooms. Also expect to have to dispute some mystery charges on you bill.
30,Rooms are dated but comfortable aside from the tiny awful bathrooms. Avoid the spa - staff is rude and self-important. Poolside service is non-existent. Signage is confusing. High points: concierge staff Heritage steak house conference facilities (except the drinks/meals) retail shops (except the spa).
30,I stayed at the Mirage hotel for a conference. We had a preferred conference rate which was still expensive but this is Vegas right? The room has no coffee maker and there is a fridge but you get charged to use it. The fridge has weight sensors in the trays so if you move their pre- loaded drinks you get charged for them. There are also goodies (snacks) in the room and they are on a weight scale also. All they want is more money.
40,We waited over an hour to check in at 1 am then they didn’t have the room we reserved so we had to change rooms the next day. In our opinion this is unacceptable. Also mobile check in wasn’t available even though i had previously received a message saying it would be.
40,Went for hubby’s bday had a great time would recommend the mirage location and food were excellent. Friendly check-in even though the hotel was busy everything was quick. Hubby had a great birthday..
40,I enjoyed my stay very much. The room was clean and we'll stocked. The lobby check in was beautiful with the aquarium behind it. The staff were very friendly and security was visible. I loved all the plants and floralb arrangement.
10,Price of bottled water was not labeled anywhere; I drank three bottles which evidently cost $54; that's $18 a bottle of water; that is egregious. After receiving my bill I called to express my disappointment in the fact that 3 bottles of water cost $54. Not once was I given an apology or any sort of sympathy via my concerns; I mentioned that I probably wouldn't stay here again and spoke to multiple people; none of which seemed to care. I was told I could find the price somewhere on/in the TV via some esoteric menu/channel/guide combination that they could not adequately explain how to find either. Seriously??
10,I already explained my experience on the first page. Contact me to discuss further. You should be ashamed of your staff and should not be so foolish as to give up thousands of dollars of future business for $36.
50,My standard King room was so much larger than my last convention stay at the MGM Grand. Rooms were clean and the conference space was easy to get to and to get around in. The pool area was a great retreat to just relax in after a long day!
30,"We stayed at the Mirage for our 10th anniversary. We booked several rooms for friends and family. The check in lines were long and slow including the mobile line. It took us almost 30 minutes to check in! We had requested an upgrade but no one acknowledged this and when I asked about it they didn't care. We found out later that another couple from our group got our room and got key cards that said ""Happy Anniversary"" which we didn't get. When we asked about this at the front desk the person just shrugged and said I hope this doesn't spoil your stay with us!! Pretty poor customer service!!"
20,The hotel rooms are dated noisy and in some cases you may have to walk a quarter mile (it seems) to get to your room from the elevators. If you’re on the north side be prepared to be woken up every hour until 11 PM by the fire show connected with the hotel. That is assuming of course that you can actually fall asleep on the uneven deeply uncomfortable beds and weak flat pillows. The buffet was very unimpressive.    All of that said everyone I interacted with was incredibly kind and helpful. It felt like I was getting 5-star service at a 1.5-star hotel. Unfortunately that service couldn’t make up for the lousy rooms disappointing ($33/dinner) buffet and lack of sleep because of all the noise.
50,We stayed at The Mirage from Oct 17 to Oct 21 2019 and it is the most excellent place to stay while in Vegas. Excellent service Excellent room Excellent Casino Excellent Dining! From the moment we checked in to the moment we left we were treated like royalty!
50,Great staff and lovely rooms. Within walking distance to everything on the Strip. Came for a conference and decided to stay the weekend. Glad I did. The free Volcano show in the evening is awesome if you stand facing the hotel.
20,Check in experience I did the mobile/email and it sent me the information upon checking in the young lady changed it from my king to queens 3 floors lower windows are nasty dirty and my limited view had spotlights shining directly in my window charging outlets and plugs defective and broken tiles cracked all over bathroom and that single ply sandpaper they call TP is awful. I do have to say congratulations to the newlyweds last night never knew people could go that long and that many rounds at 4:30 in the morning I hated walking through smoke to get to conference center
40,Mirage was a nice place to stay and provided great bedding. We did request a robe from the front desk and note that some rooms have the safe in the drawer.  Location was very central on the strip which made it easy to get around.
20,The cost for what you receive isn't worth it. I can not believe you have to pay extra for a mini fridge in the room. The fridge in the room is stocked with for sale items and if you move them you will pay for them. The hotel nickels and dimes you to death.
50,Great place to stay center of strip. Had adjoining rooms to hold 7 people. Had to pay $30 extra per room for adjoining room but worth it. Great service reasonable price very clean nice restaurants. Have stayed here before would recommend Mirage to others.
50,Stayed here for a week in a strip view room. No complaints whatsoever. Room was big clean and comfortable. We had a free buffet breakfast thrown in was very nice with lots of choice. Pool area is very crowded with beds extremely close together but is a lovely area. Nice poolside snack bar with delicious food and great cocktails.
30,The Mirage interior needs to be updated. The pool looks good but lacks any atmosphere. Bare was nice. The location is nice as you can walk to multiple other casinos. I'm simply now trying to get to 200 characters.
10,Do not stay here - this place needs to be knocked down and rebuilt. Security staff is rude. Room had issues and maintenance didn’t fix. Stay at the Wynn or Encore for a much better experience. No more MGM properties for me.
40,Pool fun but closes to early  Food excellent. Staff friendly. Room mini bat over priced as well as water in convenient store. Shopping clothes in paradise cute and well priced. Beatles show was a must see  Matt franco really good and absinthe dirty funny  All in all I would stay at mirage again. Just keep that pool open longer. Lol
30,Reasonable accommodation nothing memorable but fair value for my stay. Good convention/meeting facility convenient and good location in Las Vegas Staff are very helpful and friendly which is always a good thing in hospitality business.
50,My wife and I (and another couple) visited to celebrate my 40th birthday. It was a great trip. The hotel was very busy (all regular rooms booked). - but we were able to upgrade to a penthouse suite at a reasonable price. Service was great (had friendly dealers at the blackjack table). We ate at the Pantry several times and the Japanese restaurant once - and they were both very good. Overall great time.
30,Many years ago I remember the Mirage being the hip hotel compared to some of its more opulent neighbors but having stayed there recently I can say Mirage has lost its fastball. If you can get a good deal then by all means do it but don’t expect your experience to be the same as if you stayed at Wynn Caesars Bellagio etc. Mirage simply doesn’t offer that same experience. And with newer casinos like Aria and Cosmopolitan taking hip and luxurious to a new level Mirage is in danger of becoming a relic very quickly. It begins with the front entrance dingy carpets and old doors offer a glimpse that this property is in need of a major upgrade. Likewise the rooms are frozen in time and just feel cheaper. Our sink was clogged shower knob was loose a surge protector was visibly sticking out in the room. All things you wouldn’t find at the true luxury hotels. But Mirage still thinks itself a luxurious experience and I think it’s going through a bit of an identity crisis. In my opinion spend a little more a night to stay at one of the better properties. We spent the majority of our time dining and hanging out in Aria and Wynn. It would have just made sense to stay there and pay the difference.
50,The only negative issues that I had were; no toilet paper room was not turned down one day bubbles in carpet wall breaker kept popping so lights in bathroom kept going off. All room related service is always great since coming here from 1989 till now.
40,Good value and location. A nice hotel and casino plus they have Beatles love which is a great show. We gambled had a good breakfast and enjoyed the Beatles Love show. The value for this hotel and location was very good
20,Mostly below average experience. Room needed updating scratchy towels super smoky in casino. My husband and I honestly wanted to be anywhere but in the hotel. The bright side is that the LOVE show is playing at the Mirage.
30,Rooms were not the best for the price I have had stayed at rooms cheaper than at Mirage for a better quality rooms it was my first time staying there I don't think I would stay there again.  Great customer service very limited fun places not enough store to shop.
50,This is the perfect place to stay on the strip and totally worth the money.  It’s very central. The size of the Mirage is just right as in it’s not too big. The MGM is just huge and highly impractical for a tourist.  The staff at the Mirage were extremely friendly and helpful. Our room was immaculate and spacious.  Resort fees and taxes were clearly explained and we knew what to expect in advance.  Everything is well sign posted. I visit Vegas fairly regularly and can’t really see myself wanting to stay elsewhere any time soon.
50,The Mirage was beautiful! We felt safe and comfortable during our entire stay! Great location on the strip. The pool was a wonderful amenity and the drink selections were fabulous. We would definitely stay there again!
50,This is our 4th stay in Mirage and each time we have enjoyed the stay dining and casino. Lots of friendly staff...Makes us not missing home at all and want to stay longer.    The room was very clean. The mattress was very very comfortable to sleep in.
50,Great pools dinning gambling staff and service in all areas... lived the baby dolphin as well as the entire outdoor attractions . Loved the location as well.. so close to all great things in walking distance.. where u dont walk they have great pickup location for Uberx
40,Make sure to double when you ask something to the staff at the front desk when you check out. Or you will have to do the line twice to check out. It was my first time and I think my last time in this Hotel.
30,This hotel was an average experience for the money. I don’t know that I would necessarily stay there again. The rooms are certainly dated compared to other properties. The location was great. Overall it was a mediocre experience.
40,Just stayed at the Mirage for our 7th or 8th time. We love the location. Right in the middle of the strip and close to everything. Walgreens across the street for late night snacks and drinks. The biggest issue we have is the same as always table minimums are a bit higher than other casinos. Our fan was really loud in our bathroom and we could hear the shower running from the adjoining room. Can not beat the location.
50,Fabulous resort and casino great amenities Secret Garden was fabulous we even met Siegfried twice he was so charming And gracious. We did the VIP dolphin behind the scenes tour. So interesting our guide was amazing.
40,We had a great time. 3rd trip. Will come back. 95% of stay and stay was awesome. We had one issue with a few workers at craps table who were rude. We won several 1000 playing craps and instead of the crew being nice things got progressively worse. It was a real bummer. Sucks how one rotten moment sticks out from an otherwise awesome experience at the Mirage.
40,I've stayed at the Mirage a few times. The rooms are definitely starting to look more worn. But hotel and property overall is still nice. Decent restaurant selection. Nice pool Area. Hotel and casino are not as overwhelmingly big as some of the others. It is fairly easy to get around the pool hotel and casino.
50,From reservations to check in to bell services etc all are wonderful and friendly and give you the time you need to resolve or answer anything. The location is so perfect to so many things to do and within walking distance
50,I could not have picked a better place to stay from my first experience of Las Vegas. It is located fairly centrally on the Strip restaurants provided numerous options and the pool is very nice. The staff were always helpful and pleasant. M Life is something everyone should sign up for!
40,Travelling for business booked the Mirage due to convenience of location and value pricing. Rooms were clean and serviced well. Staff was very friendly. The Heritage Steakhouse was amazing. Overall a wonderful trip!
30,The Mirage is gorgeous classy and beautiful. Attended the Matt Goss concert in the 1-Oak Showroom. It wasn’t really my cup of tea but most of the audience were Brits as is Mr. Goss. They really seemed to enjoy the concert clapping singing dancing and cheering. He was very active with the audience shaking everyone’s hand and asking “How are you?” He has several funny bits.    He has a good voice but on the faster cover numbers the tempo was off to the point it was difficult to know what sing he was singing. The ballads were excellent his voice came through loud and clear in “Unforgettable” and “My Way.” The dancers were excellent!
20,Have stayed at the Mirage for the last few years and really liked it. This year our first room literally had feces on the ground wasn't vacuumed and furniture was all damaged. The hotel and rooms are so outdated now. They were on one hand nice enough to switch our room to a newer one that was very clean but the bed is as hard as a rock. Got zero sleep it's that bad... Can't believe I have four more days here. Never again!
50,We have been staying at the Mirage since 2011. Our first trip to Vegas was in a hotel we didn't care for but my husband wanted to try again with another property. Now nine years later we are on our 11th trip to the Mirage! So that's really saying something. We are fortunate enough to have a FANTASTIC Casino Host who has become a friend. Willie Haddock IS THE BEST! He treats us like the VIPs I wish we actually were! From the day the trip is booked we are taken care of. We are picked up in style with a Mirage limo treated like royalty in the VIP Lounge. The suite is always spotless. Service from the bell desk to housekeeping to maintenance was outstanding. The Mirage employees take great pride in their jobs and everyone I encountered was warm and welcoming. The restrooms...especially the one by the Box Office/Love Show is the cleanest bathroom I have ever set foot in. Every year it gets cleaner??? :) If you don't like the food at the Mirage then you have problems...LOL. STACK Costa Heritage Cravings LVB the Pantry...every meal we had was fantastic. I am still thinking about my burger from STACK! If I would offer one suggestion it would be the lack of varieties of Video Poker machines. They need more and different kinds. Also the machines that I have enjoyed in the past don't stay long. I LOVED the Friends machine and it was removed after one year. Not only from the Mirage but all the casinos...believe me I checked ;) I am hoping one day to take our whole family out to Vegas and stay at the Mirage for a special treat. It would be expensive but the memories would be worth it. It feels like home to us and we are always comfortable and welcomed! From the top down they do an amazing job!
50,We managed to get 2 comped nights at the Mirage through the MyVegas App. We actually stayed at another resort for our first 2 nights in Vegas. We arrived mid-morning and found the gentleman at the registration desk to be very friendly and more than helpful. He helped us upgrade from a Resort King room to a Resort Tower King room for a very small fee. Resort Tower rooms are on the 24th and 25th floors with elevators exclusively for those 2 floors. The room was very nice with a very nice bathroom. The views were terrific. Looking out onto the strip with the volcano show every evening. We did have a problem with our in-room safe but security and maintenance were there within 10 minutes to replace the entire thing. One other thing that they do that made us feel more secure was the security was ensuring only guests with key cards could access the room elevators at night. Overall we loved staying at the Mirage. Would do again in a heartbeat!
40,The room is average but I must admit to laughing at the review mentioning the short toilets. It's true. The water is way too close to the top. The prices for water and mini-bar are high at every hotel but these prices were truly astronomical. The hotel overall is nice and the staff is really great. I don't have a single complaint whatsoever about the staff and that takes things from 3 stars to 4 stars. Not impressive enough (at these prices) to give 5.
50,This was not my first stay at The Mirage and it won't be my last. Had a great time. Good food great service. I'll gladly return. I would have preferred that the Pay Gow minimum was $10 rather than $25.
30,Long Lines for Breakfast and A Long Walk for Morning Coffee! Bulky pillows short toilet and some dangling parts get wet! Expensive place for food! No clock in room and no room coffee! The place does have some nice fountains and flora.
50,My friend and I had so much fun and saw so much of Las Vegas. I had been to Vegas in 2016 and didn't see as much as this time. I also stayed at the Mirage in 2016. It is a beautiful placed to stay and play and was middle of the strip. Will definitely say here again.
50,The Mirage is big enough to get all you want from a Vegas experience but small enough for staff to know your name and face. I stay here every trip I take and the people cound not be friendlier. I would not stay anywhere else.
10,I was ready to leave this hotel the second we checked in. We paid for an upgraded room which was really just a standard room on a higher floor. Everything was dingy and old and felt like it was about to fall apart at the seams. Small but annoying detail: there were only two outlets in the bedroom which isn't very useful for the average person. The internet barely worked and made working from the room in the day nearly impossible.  We went to the pool at 12 on a Monday the pool deck was packed and felt over crowded. The pool itself was nice and fine for swimming.  When we returned from lunch and swimming it sounded like someone was running the sink but it turned out to be a massive amount of water leaking from the bathroom ceiling fan directly into the toilet. I called the front desk and was told someone would be right up. An hour passes no one comes.  I heard the housekeeper outside the room and asked for more towels to sop up all the water. She was shocked and came in to make a phone call. She communicated to someone on the other line that it was really bad and someone needed to come up immediately. Luckily they listened to her and the maintenance men arrived. They joked that they fix these all the time. They made the call to the front desk and they seemed reluctant to move us. They finally agreed to move us we thought we might get a better room now... but no of course not. They moved us to an identical crap room down the hall.  We will never be staying here again.
50,celebrated birthday in vegas. Enjoyed stay in mirrage. Also enjoyed poolm spa and fitness. Food is excellent. House keeping services were excellent. Have a good experience with a filipina housekeeper.
10,Offered an upgrade to a suite at check in and agreed to pay the extra charge. When we got to the room it was a standard room with 2 double beds. We had originaly reserved a standard king. So this was a downgrade. Management said the check in clerk made a mistake and there was no way they would honor their offer of an upgrade. They also would not let us have our original room as they had already given it away. 24 hours 4 rooms to finally get into an exceptable room. It was their mistake but tough luck for us. We finally ended up in the room we originally wanted to upgrade to (not a suiteas they offered) but were told none avaliable. The check in clerk also did not authorize both of us charging priviliges as asked and did not activate parking as asked. And that was just day 1.
40,Although the casino slot machines seemed to take-take-take we loved the remodeled one bedroom suite. The elevators were quick and the food choices were very good. We ate at Carvings Buffet for brunch and it was very good.
10,Gave my suit the the hotel to dry clean but the slaves were slightly torn after I got them back. Hotel wouldn't take responsibility because they outsource it to a 3rd party. They wanted me to directly deal with the dry cleaners.  I guess if you get food poisoning at one of their restaurants you have to call the food suppliers.  I wasted 4 hours of my stay here with various people from bell desk to front desk to supervisors to security. At the end they gave me number to call at their risk management office. I left them them a message and they never called me back.  This was the 3rd time staying here in ~2 months for work. I won't be staying here again.
30,As a casino goes this one is okay. It's a little on the new side so they're ventilation system is just slightly above-average. Went here to see a Cirque du Soleil show. The theater was amazing.The theater was amazing.
40,The Mirage was a nice resort. I enjoyed everything it had to offer. I had a problem with my breakfast order 1 out of 4 mornings from the Pantry. It was delicious and they fixed the problem swiftly. The room smelled like smoke but it was probably because of the casino. I enjoyed my stay and will be back.
50,We had a pleasant stay at the Mirage from the clean room to the entertainment you will have a great time. The food was really great even the buffet was affordable and Yummy.... The Beatles Love show is a must and the SPORTS center as super even as a women I enjoyed spending time with my husband watching NASCAR and the next night baseball... So much FUN!
20,Windows were so dirty could not see out of them. They had not been cleaned in months if not years especially the bottom ones. Also they never told us we had to pay $24 for parking until we tried to get our car out from valet. Weird!
50,This was our fourth trip to Vegas and we really liked the Mirage. The location on the strip was perfect.    Room was clean and well appointed.    For those who have not visited Vegas before you need to budget for the resort fees. All the hotels charge these. For the Mirage they were around $40per night.
50,It was a great experience. The hotel was very nice and clean. The staff were friendly and always available for questions or recommendations. The location is ideal being in the center of the strip. Would recommend the hotel.
30,After staying at the Mirage so many other times and having such  good times we were totally disappointed this tripand would never stay here again everything was over priced and the quality of the food was not that good
40,I would highly recommend staying at the Mirage. I come to Las Vegas about 3 times a year and i always stay at the Mirage! The only downfall is the hotel and casino is on the north end of strip. Other than that I can’t find anything to complain about.
10,Terrible beds! Very loud hotel staff cleaning rooms banging doors at 8:30 in the morning and yelling in the hallways. Walls are paper thin. Don’t play slots here either. They take your money and never pay!! I mean never!
30,The mirage main property checkin and casino is overall really nice and inviting. The staff was courteous and made the experience enjoyable overall. The hotel room on the other hand was over priced for the quality. The bathroom was small and the shower/tub was enough to skip staying there again. A few other maintenance issues were prevalent in the room itself and again for the price was NOT adequate.
50,Business and Pleasure trip. Had a great time the Casino is within walking distance of many properties. Did not have to take a taxi or Uber anywhere. Stayed for four days and had no issues with the staff. They went out of their way to be helpful and courteous.
50,My husband LOVES the Mirage. I always suggest trying a new property but he insists we keep coming back! We get some VIP services such as limo to and from airport comped rooms some meal credit and a few other things. I wish they gave more credit for food because that does not take long to accumulate! This place is fantastic. The people in every department are nice they love their jobs they are friendly...Can't say enough good things about how much pride they take at the Mirage! Just returned and hopefully we can plan another trip for the spring!
50,Service and room was excellent. Staff was very helpfull. The show that we went too was top notch. Hotel was very clean and situated close to everything that we needed to get. Would definately stay at the Mirage again.
50,Had 2x1 5 nights thanks to myvegas app whiche mean paid only 32 usd between me and my friend and the dinner was absolutely great. Very tasty fresh (especially the salmon and shrimps). Service fast and kind. We will be back!
30,We booked this hotel mainly for the guarantee of having an open pool but also the excellent location. The hotel itself is ok. The ventilation on the casino floor was below average compared to other hotels. We had wanted to try the California pizza restaurant but the smell of cigarette smoke was so overpowering we had to eat offsite.    Our room (2048) was a little tired. One of the headboards was really badly ripped and peeling and there was a fair bit of wear and tear in the bathroom but nothing we couldn’t live with. We stayed for 3 nights and our room was not vacuumed at all during our stay so the carpets were a bit icky by the time we left. Small details like dirty glasses and not having enough towels would’ve gone a long way. The pool makes up for a bit of what the interior is lacking it’s beautiful. Some of the pool towels we got were quite badly ripped or had holes in them – I think some attention to detail on behalf of management like not using towels that have a fist sized hole in them could really transform guests stays into an upscale experience so hopefully they pay attention to these reviews. I would stay here again but mainly for the location and pool and manage my expectations for the interior accordingly.
20,Had poor service at check in the person was rude and not informative and then we did not get the room we booked. Beds were not comfortable. Location is great casino was clean buffet was not worth it. After the experience we had we will not be staying here again.
10,This hotel is no longer a top hotel on the strip. It is a tired property where clearly no one care any more. From the casino marketing host to the service personnel to the selection of beverages they just “mail it in”.
50,Myself and my wife and daughter went to this Hotel and it was a late check in and the woman that checked us in was great! friendly and she recognized that it was me and wife's anniversary and treated us very nice. The room was outstanding as well as the The Buffet and California Pizza....The beds and pillows were great as well! it was my second time there but certainly not my last!
50,Had an excellent time at the Mirage. I had been at the Mirage several times before for Casino fun and enjoying the food options. This was my first time staying at the Mirage and it was vey enjoyable facility.
40,This is an iconic hotel on the Vegas Strip due to the movie Vegas Vacation. I've always wanted to stay here and had reservations to stay for New Year's Eve 2009 but ended up getting a free room at Vdara (a new hotel at the time) as they were overbooked. I still haven't gotten a chance to stay here but it's on my to do list. We love strolling through the property. At night there is a Mirage Volcano show every so often (every 15-30 minutes). You should also check out The Secret Garden & Dolphin Habitat where you can see dolphins as well as Seigfried & Roy's white tigers. We try to stroll through here when we can on our visits and one day we will actually stay here!
30,1. Toilet would barely flush. Had to flush multiple times sometimes having to wait a while and try again.  2. Bathtub stopper didn't work so I couldn't take a long hot bath like I wanted to.  3. I planned to check out on the TV as advertised so I waited until right before time to meet my Uber but the checkout feature on the TV didn't actually work so I had to hurry to check out downstairs.  4. I was attending a conference at The Mirage so it was not my choice to stay there. Having to walk through that nasty casino full of smoke was a nightmare. Cigarette smoke makes me physically ill. There should be ways to get around the resort without HAVING to walk through the casino. We should not be FORCED to endure that cigarette smoke. It was HORRIBLE!
40,I found the casino a little dark for my taste but this did not take away from a great experience. The ticket redemption machines were a much better option than waiting in line at the cashier and there were ample machines which worked. I have been to some casinos who have the machines but they were not in working order which kinds of defeats the purpose.
50,I love this hotel! This is my second visit to the Mirage last time I was here was ten years ago. It is just how I remember- fantastic pool great selection of restaurants large rooms and an awesome staff. The staff really stood out to me this visit every member we came in contact with from wait staff to concierge to housekeeping was so friendly and so helpful. The Mirage is also in a great location on the strip. My only complaint if you can call it that was the drink prices but unfortunately I believe it is that way all over the strip.
50,Received 4 free nights thru Mlife here. I’ve stayed at Mirgae the last 8 times I’ve been to Vegas. Love the location. Pool restaurants and gaming In the casino itself. Thought the drinks could be a little cheaper at pool and the center bar we frequented $30+ for two old fashioneds is a little steep. Overall had a wonderful stay. Will be back for sure.
50,"The Mirage is an iconic resort of the Las Vegas strip. It combines the established ambiance of the past decades with the new vitality of the present. l am not a ""whale"" but they treat me as if I am special."
50,Every person I interacted with from Esther at check in Carlos with room service to Rex at the Concierge desk after checkout (to name a few) were extremely friendly and went above and beyond to make my stay amazing but to add a personal touch.
50,The mirage has something for everyone food nightlife.  casino and the best sportsbook in Las Vegas. Hotel casino property is easily navagaited.Plenty of elevators make for no wasted time. A friendly and helpful staff make your stay a pleasure.
50,Great staff. Very clean. Nice location. It was our second time staying here. Love the pool and the show at night with the volcano. Buffet was always good and the daily room credit doesn’t hurt either :)
40,We’ve stayed at the Mirage every year for 13 years straight four nights in October every year and love it!  It’s in a busy part of the strip close to Caesars Venetian Palazzo the Linq etc. Sports bar is a cool place to hang out have some drinks play video poker and have fun.  Sports Book is professionally run and easy to place bets.  The Beatles Love show on premises was an absolutely fantastic experience!
50,"My husband and I stayed at the Mirage with 2 other couples from Sept. 25th - Oct. 4th 2019. This was my husband and my first trip to Vegas. People kept telling us that 10 days was too long of time to spend in Vegas! I totally disagree! We had the best vacation!!!  We saw Carrot Top Daniel Tosh the Grand Canyon Hoover Dam Big Elvis Secret Garden of Siegfried and Roy and the Cirque du Soleil ""O"" Show. All the shows were amazing! We did some shopping at the outlets. I got some great deals!  Our room was really nice bright and very clean. The staff at the Mirage were really friendly and helpful! They really made us feel so welcome! Staff Scott Porter does a great job to make sure that the guests at the Mirage are well looked after! Thank you Scott!  We ate a lot of our meals at the buffet at the Mirage because the food was delicious and there was lots to pick from. We loved the pool area and spent part of our day their. The pool was very clean and well kept. The air quality at the Casino is so much better then alot of the other casinos we walked through. I really liked the fact that the resort was centrally located on the Strip. The resort is not too big and the Casino is well layed out.  We did not win our fortune but can't wait to return to Vegas and stay at the Mirage!"
40,This is still a very good Hotel and drink and table prices are better than at many comparable hotels. You can also save a little on dining. The rooms are very good but the casino is aging and in need of renovations. For luxury there are better options. Enjoyed cocktails and service.
40,great location-close to almost everything. Good dining options and very friendly staff. Only bad thing we had some issues with the room that were not taken care of during our stay-only minor things but still disappointed not fixed.
30,We arrived at around midnight (3 am our time) The on-line check in apparently doesn't work for this time period as we never received an online response and there was no one at the online counter. There was a relatively long line for check in through the normal process and it took around five to fifteen minutes to help each customer or group to check in. We stood in line for over an hour.....very discouraging for new arrivals. The last time we went our room wasn't ready until 7pm and when we finally went up to our room it wasn't cleaned yet. Despite the inconveniences no compensations were given. We've always stayed at the Mirage when coming to Vegas but I don't think we'll be staying here anymore.
50,Nice hotel great service good value! Stayed there with family pool was lovely open a little later than most. Hotel is pleasant and clean. Lots to see and do. Would recommend location in walking distance to other casinos. Easy check in and parking.
50,The Mirage is fabulous and the very best place to stay in Las Vegas! We will be back next year and in fact we will be making our next reservation way in advance! Thank you Mirage for your exceptional service.....so classy!!!!
40,Great location on the strip. Hotel is beautiful but I was surprised at the upkeep and cleanliness of our room. Multiple broken/not working items and could have been much cleaner. Looked like it was cleaned quickly and only good enough to appear clean until you start noticing large build ups of dust in the corners spills dried on the wall/ceiling that looked like they had been there for a while etc
20,From the moment we arrived at 1 AM it took 40+ minutes to check in and get our room key. All I can say is the bed was very comfortable but some of the furniture in our room was damaged and the bathroom was somewhat dirty. The desk staff was curt and the only staff we encountered that was outwardly friendly was the housekeeping staff.
40,Birthday gift for my Mom who is gambler at heart. Tight slots made for disappointing casino experience (yes we know. It's Vegas) Locals say old strip (The D Golden Nugget) pay better but unable to make it down there. She had a good time overall.
50,Very nice casino and rooms. View was great from room. Sports book was massive with very large TVs. Poker room had a great vibe and was very well run. Would defiantly stay here again. House keeping staff brought whatever was requested within mins of calling.
50,This was my first trip to Las  Vegas in 20 years and I always wanted to stay at the mirage. I was not disappointed. From when we arrived until we left it was a memorable stay and I will be there again in a few months.
30,"The room was as expected. Be sure to enroll in the ""M-Life"" rewards program before booking for decent room discounts. The food? My husband have adopted a low-carb eating regimen and felt it would be easiest to eat in the buffet so that we could pick and choose at will rather than going to a regular restaurant to customize every order. The buffet while super expensive was extremely disappointing. Yes there is a wide variety of foods to select from but none of the things that we had were anything to write home about. Oh the coffee...it really was good. Eggs were lukewarm and not at all seasoned cooked veggies provided were way overcooked and under seasoned. Our mistake was not ordering a ""made to order"" omelette. Dinner SUPER EXPENSIVE and the same thing...under-seasoned over-cooked meats and vegetables. The salad bar was good beverages were good. Otherwise meh. The resort is beautiful but we did not take advantage of any of those amenities so the extra tax on our bill was not appreciated. Nor was having for our first time in 40 years to pay for parking in our own hotel. Wow. Felt greedy when you consider that they want you to stay eat play and take advantage of the shows to ALSO charge you for parking. Really? This may now be the norm in Vegas but it was a surprise nonetheless."
20,My check-in experience was horrible. The lady did not offer any upgrades didn't smile and was very difficult to work with. She took my phone into the backroom with out asking and was annoyed that I even asked questions.
30,First time at this property. Room was marginally clean and furniture was worn. Bathroom vent fan pumped cigarette smell into the room during my shower. Very disappointed considering price and reputation of property
10,Our family had booked this property for a wedding not just a wedding but other events on property for the whole wedding party. When checking in only to find out the block of rooms had been canceled. This ruined the start to a very special time.
10,We stayed wed- sun smoking was manageable until Friday- then it was overwhelming on the casino floor and at the pool.  We were denied entrance by a security guard at a back entrance when we got lost and were told to “keep walking” down what was almost a highway to a different back entrance for Mirage off Sammy Davis Blvd.  We were advised by Check In Staff NOT to touch the minibar or fridge- there are sensors.  We were vigilant about not touching the minibar in any way. 20 min after checkout a new bill was emailed to me with an $18 charge for a minibar drink. My sister got the same charge on her bill - sent on a delay because the hotel hopes you’ve already left. They made me get back in the check in line (2nd 35 minute wait in this line) to correct their “mistake” which is actually just a scam. They have no guest services desk and no customer service to speak of. The rooms were run down and worn. My husband didnt fit under the shower head- he had to crouch down to get his hair wet. RIDICULOUS
50,Clean comfortable room. Very quiet and good air conditioning. Staff very nice and helpful. Casino clean and relatively smoke free. Would stay here again. Good location. Easy to get in and out of parking structure.
10,Booked a room at the Mirage to see Bill Maher at the Terry Fator Theater for a birthday.    The hotel is extremely dated. Worse the condition of the room we were placed in was terrible. It was old dirty and worn. There were broken light switch and electrical outlet plugs worn furnishings etc. we booked a “volcano view” room but didn’t get it. Instead we got a view of the roof of one of the buildings. They charge a resort fee of nearly $40 which is standard. However the WiFi didn’t work at all during the stay and exiting parking was a hassle. Our room key wouldn’t work it took about ten minutes to get someone to fix the issue. Worst of all I ordered a late check out at 3:00pm for a fee of $50.00. Still housekeeping entered the room twice once at 10:00 and and again at 11:30 am. Needless to say I didn’t get the sleep I’d hoped for before catching my flight home. There are really great MGM properties on the Strip. The Mirage is not one of them.
40,Location is good and easy access to both taxi stand or uber pick up. Hotel is clean and reasonable prices. Beatles show is worth to go as well. Service is good overall. Will definitely go back again/ recommend to others.
40,Cool place with a good location. The dolphins exhibit is cool. Overall I’d stay here again but I gotta mark them down for two main reasons: 1) In Vegas on a Friday night the fact that they have one restaurant open after 11pm is a complete joke. 2) Their checkin desk is a total cluster. Major buzz kill standing in line for 45-minutes when you just landed and want to get on with your night. And the line was long every time we walked by over four days this needs addressing.
40,Overall my Vegas experience was very positive. It was my first time visiting my first time gambling and my first time taking on a big city all alone. Even the dealers were patient with me as I learned how to play to lose or win.
40,We recently visited here on a 4 day stay. The hotel is still nice. Our room had some small issues with table lamps not working which was resolved. Toilet had some flushing issues but also worked out. Odd thing to me was the hallway outside our room was always much colder than our room. My main complaint is the hotel restaurants are WAY to pricey. Breakfast for 2 $60+...come on! Go to Denny’s across the street.  Maid service was good each day. The pool was good. A small section of the pool was closed off but I didn’t see it being an issue. We visited the Sigfield & Roy habitat. Dolphins were very interesting & viewing was easy as the underwater viewing area is nice. I felt sorry for the tigers as they appear bored. This is one way to protect them but I’d rather see them roaming in much larger open area. We did this trip with Expedia thinking it was a deal. Not much in my opinion but that’s another review.
50,My husband and I have travelled to Las Vegas many many times ( 26 or 27 ... we lost track ) and have stayed at various hotels both on & off the strip. We just got back the other day from a 5 day stay at The Mirage . I have to say it was probably one of our very best trips to Vegas. The rooms are clean and have super comfortable beds. They happened to be doing maintenance on rooms on our floor which was great to see ... there were many maintenance men in & out of the rooms changing filters painting walls giving each room a thorough once over. We have never seen that at any of the other hotels and appreciated that they did that rather than wait for a guest to check in and discover their AC isn’t working or the whatever is broke. The rooms smelled fresh & clean and not old & musty. As we left our room and headed down the hallway each of them greeted us good morning and then carried on with they’re day. Spent a few days around the pool - we had no problem finding chairs ( which can sometimes be a challenge ). The service around the pool was fantastic - Heather was amazing ! She had a fairly large area to cover but she served everyone very quickly and was smiling and friendly. The location on the strip is great - right in the middle of everything. Walgreens right across the street  so you can pick up whatever you may have forgotten or drinks for your room. We will most definitely go back to the The Mirage. It was one of our best stays in Vegas.
50,I just read some 1 star reviews with amazement. Yes there is a resort fee which absolutely sucks but all the strip hotels have it so calm down. Yes the fridge is full of pay product. This is Vegas fridges don't come with the room unless your are paying extra or staying at a more expensive place. Yes there is smoking in the casino along with every other casino in Vegas. Anyways.... This was my 15th time in Vegas and my first staying at mirage. We visit the mirage every trip as we love the buffet and have been to the secret garden multple times. Lots of good food choices on site and the resort is in a great location. I've check out all the pools in Vegas and the mirage has one of the nicer pools.
30,The hotel was ok the staff was mostly friendly. They do have the amazing show “Love” put to Beatles music. But the hotel just isn’t all that special. The walls/windows/door are thin - I could hear everything going on around me - not to mention since I was facing the back of the hotel hearing the freight train whistle as it went by (it’s on the other aide of the freeway!) Not my favorite stay.
50,We have stayed at The Mirage many many times. It is our preferred hotel/casino in Vegas. We consider it almost a boutique experience compared to the massive venues surrounding it yet if offers ammenities galore; fast-casual to fine dining great casino wonderful spa and pool area etc...The employees are warm and inviting. We really love either the mobile or VIP check-in process-no long lines! We always have a great experience there!
30,Our daughter ( with different last name) purchased ticket to the terry Vader show. she purchased the tuckets thru her name with her creditcard. she went to front desk the night of the show and was told tgey would NOT giver her the tickets sge herself ordered paid for wuth HER creditcard. Was told the tickets were in her fathers name and they coyld only give them to me.( She's 40 yrs old and married? when she asked why? was told yoy need ti speak with the ticket office after she did they told her utwas because of her my life rewards card was used. I visited vegas the year before used a different credit card BS!
50,Mirage Hotel - Wonderful - Nice -p Reaasonable  It offers many perks. Staff is great.  It has many restaurants.  Food and beverage is delicious and reasonable.  Pools are always clean.  The zoo outside is adorable and nice.  Retail stores is always fully staffed. If you present your players card from the hotel you receive a discount.  If
10,Visited for 4 nights and trouble started at check in. They extort $41.95 in resort fees per night from you. Being from the UK the benefits are ZERO. I didn’t have a car to park or know anyone local to call etc this is a complete rip off. The cost in sterling was £129 for absolutely nothing. Also at check in they refused to accept the cash passport MasterCard that we had to pay with. It is the type where you load cash onto the card at home before you travel I credited my card in Tesco and it is accepted all over the world. I had already been on an 11 night cruise from Vancouver to Hawaii and Celebrity cruises were happy to accept it. After the cruise we spent 4 nights in the Aston Waikiki beach hotel on Oahu and they were happy to accept it as were all the local establishments in the area. But when we arrived on the last leg of our holiday in Las Vegas the Mirage refused to accept it and wouldn’t let us check in unless we provided another card.  So very grudgingly I had to provide them my MasterCard I use at home. Not only did they claim the £129 but they also decided to hold on to just over £370 of my funds as well !!! When I checked my online banking down I went and asked what was going on and I wanted those funds available I was met with apathy and a couldn’t care less attitude. Sorry I forgot to mention that the woman at check in was rude and even said to my wife “I’ve got one just like him at home”  On our last night my wife wanted to go and see the Beatles show in the hotel we went to the box office for tickets and quite amazingly they were happy to accept my cash passport MasterCard for payment . You couldn’t make it up could you ?  As for the room well they loaded the fridge up full so you can’t put your own milk or water in there to cool and the fridge has sensors so if you take something out they assume you’ve had it and try to charge you yet another rip off. There are no tea or coffee making facilities in the room and they don’t even sell anything in the hotel shops so you can make your own just another example of this hotel trying to screw you out of every last penny because we checked out other hotels and at least you can get a cuppa in the others  If you’re a non smoker get ready for a shock because smoking is just about everywhere on the casino floor and in the bars which will come as a shock to Brits  All in all the most cutthroat place I’ve ever stayed poor facilities and rude staff. Never ever again
10,I stay at the Mirage every year for a conference every year I complain about how bad the smell of smoke is. But this year I had so many issues - one of my neighbors was smoking in their room one was taking conference calls right outside my door and there was a used condom on the floor of my room next to the bed! When I complained to the hotel they offered me a voucher for breakfast! Seriously the one area you expect people to see in not hygienic why on earth would I want to eat from your kitchen!
50,Stunning property with great Strip access. The Uber pickup and drop off is easy to access and there is a Southbound bus stop right in front of the hotel. The beautiful pool was inviting and had multiple waterfalls and plenty of seating with complimentary cold water. The Secret Garden is a must-visit for anyone staying at the Mirage. The animals are well cared for and trainers are knowledgeable and again there's complimentary cold water.
10,Despite the privacy notice on the door house keeping attempted to come in all three days of my stay. Security stopped by “because no one had see me” and despite that I was sleeping forced me to come to the door. I won’t be making the mistake of staying here again
50,We had a really bad situation that I’m not going to mention only because Rex at concierge was so great at addressing it. He took control of the situation and redirected my girlfriends horrifying first impression of Las Vegas into a positive experience for me and my girlfriend. Camaron at front desk was also very nice and helpful. Overall everyone working here is very nice except for that one guy which I won’t get into because concierge was accommodating. I felt like Rex was genuinely sympathetic to what happened and made the situation better.
50,Four of us stayed at the Mirage and enjoyed the property very much. Starting with check-in at the busy time Shelly the desk clerk was very professional and friendly. We had a nice king tower room which was clean and quite. Casino was always busy and we enjoyed the slots. The overall property is slightly dated but well kept. Parking was easy and convienent.
50,very happy very convenient with being able to stay at the hotel as the event. Super Duper happy with Thursday and looking forward to staying again next year for our next years convention.    Thank you very much
50,We drove here from the GC. It was easy to find and the staff were great valet parking and also at booking us in.    The room was easy to find well laid out clean and spacious. A little annoyed the notices on the fridge are not very clear and the staff nicked my Snickers that I had put in it because it had gone soft on the journey. A bit petty.    We ordered room service one night that never arrived but it still arrived on the bill. It was removed without question at check out.    Great being able to check the bill on the TV in the room.    Great service throughout the venue.    Would stay again.
40,This was my second stay at the Mirage it's a nice place good value and great location the line for check-in was a bit too long- that is my only real criticism the room was nice the facilities are clean
50,Have stayed here over a dozen times. Easy access in a out of hotel. Best pool on strip. Good choices of restaurants. Very easy walk to 4 other major resorts and Forum and Canal Shoppes shopping. Perfect location. Clean and easy to walk around. Not too big but not too small. Shows there are excellent.
40,"Love staying there during our ""girl trips"" love the private pool. Room is always nice and clean with great views. Staff is always welcoming and nice as well. No Pepsi on site though....otherwise it would be a 10!"
20,Stayed at the Mirage for a week for a couples trip. We've stayed at many other properties and found this was by far the lesser of them. Hotel shows a bit of age but we didn't mind it. Rooms were nice and of fair size. Casino is average size but the air quality is so stuffy that we never stayed to play. I'm not one to complain about air quality but my nose was stuffed all week and it exhausted us. We found the casino and TI and casino royal across the street to be more enjoyable. Comped drinks are becoming more and more strict in the casino. I can't comment on the payouts of the machines but from what we were told by others they're super tight.    Food and amenities are less than to be desired for. LV Burger was the exception it was a great quality burger spot. We tried the Italian restaurant which was similar to the quality of East side Mario's. Breakfast at the hotel is tough to find for a reasonable price. I'm ok with inflated pricing at a resort but this place will downright pillage you for most things. After our first day we never spend a dime here.    Bartenders.... Honestly I don't know what the deal is here but they ignore you and when coming over to you they're dry and seem irritable. Comped drinks come with an extra attitude. Omar (I believe that's his name bald fella that works at the lobby bar) was just a downright jerk and we filed a complaint against him. For people who work on tips they aren't trying very hard to earn that extra money. There were a couple of very nice ones though but mainly rude ones.    Pool is award winning and service was top notch in that area.    Overall there are so many better options in Vegas and on the strip. We will not be staying here again and do not recommend at all.
40,The staff was friendly. The room was clean. The bed was quite firm. The room was quiet it was easy to sleep. The bathtub drain stopper was broken so no soaking bath but the shower worked fine. The in-room water was $18 a bottle!
40,We were at the Mirage for a conference and the best thing about our stay was probably that we didn't have to walk through the smokey casino to go from the elevators to the event center on the property. My room was huge but it wasn't dusted well and I found long black hairs all over the bathroom including in the shower and on the towels. We enjoyed our stay though!
50,My wife and I have been to Vegas several times over the past several years. This was our first stay at the Mirage. The grounds hotel casino are very attractive clean well maintaineddecorated nicely. The staff that we came in contact with were all so friendly and accommodating. We only ate at one restaurant at Mirage that was Carniegie Deli. The food was very good and lots of it. The prices were fair and reasonable. The Mirage's location on the strip is ideal. We would definitely stay here again.
30,With so many hotels offering the same thing the only thing the outdated Mirage can offer is customer service which was ok.  Overall it was a nice place with mostly nice staff but lacked any kind of wow factor.  The machines treated me VERY well the tables did not. I’d go back but would look for a better deal elsewhere first.
40,The Mirage took away the free beer and wine at the buffet. Now they charge you an extra $8 to get unlimited beer and wine. I know that doesn’t sound like a lot of money but the free beer and wine was a really great perk. One thing I noticed was there was less people going up to the bar then my last visit when they had the free beer and wine. If the Mirage would charge an extra $2 or $4 fee added into the price of the buffet then they can make the bar free again. This tells me that the Mirage only cares about their bottom line and not their guests.
50,2nd time staying at the Mirage. Food is great. Sports book and casino floor are awesome. Beds are comfortable. Rooms are very clean. Great location. We will definitely be staying at the mirage again..
10,"The resort food and drink options are too expensive. $7.00 for a bottle of water is ridiculous from vending machine. $20.00 for a cocktail at any of the bars and $10.00 a beer are way too much. This is a casino not a NFL football stadium. The free cocktails are too small and too few and far between. We requested a volcano view room when reservations were made. Once we checked in we we're placed in a room overlooking the roof of the lower floors and a highway. I've had better views at a motel 6 and Bestwestern. Was told at the check in desk ""sorry"" no other rooms were available. Bottom line pricing for dining and drinks are stupid high and a waste of money."
40,Next year we’ll be back in some Mgm resort maybe Mgm park as mirage getting old and need some work. What happened to the $5 blackjack tables? Great shows we saw Aerosmith at the mgm park and “O” at the Bellagio and they were both awesome.
50,Stayed last week of Sept.This was the 1st time check in person wasn't friendly.She said Here's your keys to your King Resort Tower Room.The room was on 29th floor & had 2 queen beds with a window behind desk with a view of Linq area & wheel.We decided to go with 2 beds.It turned out 2 be blessing because we both got ill & had trouble sleeping.Window let in morning light which we appreciate.Room very quiet except Friday night when we could hear neighbors spanking each other & another couple had a screaming match.Just happens when in Vegas with drinkydrinky.M Life staff really kind as was cleaning staff.Bed & pillows so comfortable.Room clean & AC worked well.Loved Oasis pool.We bought seats there most of week to super relax & recuperate.Everyone there was friendly & helpful .Whole building was clean & safe.The tropical feel of the whole complex makes it feel like a island getaway.😍
20,Cons  No A/C in room told manager. Nothing done! Prices on food was crazy expensive and food was sub par.  LVB burger was the only good food there but not much better than McDonald's.  Buffet was not good  No fridge microwave or coffee maker. (Probably a good thing cause kcups there would be 10.00 a cup)  Slot pays sucked.  Crazy strong smell in the air smelled good but too strong. Like you could taste the smell strong!  Pros  Room rate wasn't horrible  Rooms where clean and housekeeping was great.  Ice was free  Easy to walk to better places to eat!  Clean  Easy to walk across the street to Walgreens to buy somewhat cheaper beer and liquor!
30,The staff deserve a score higher than 5. However I wouldn’t rate the rooms higher than 3. They were only average and ours was showing its age. Housekeeping staff were amazing. They always had a warm smile and greeting for anyone they saw. I find it ridiculous in this day and age to not even have at a minimum a coffee pot in the room. You have nothing so be prepared for that. Everything is jacked up in cost. Some price increase I do expect at places like this but the jacked up prices for Starbucks and their normal food offerings was crazy. Although I still bought it. I am a Starbucks junky. Location of the hotel on the strip is good.
50,We stayed for three nights through offers from MyVegas and MLife. We really enjoyed this property. We had booked a king room but we checked in at 9 am on 10/6 and were told we could get a room right away if we were willing to take a double queen or wait until a king became available. We were very tired so we took the double queen. We arrived to room 03-0064. Not much of a view but beggars can't be choosers when checking in at 9 am. The room was clean and had everything we needed for three nights. We didn't have any issues with noise as others have commented. Yes you can hear people opening and closing their doors and the occasional stomping from guests above you but that's expected in any hotel.    The pool area was nice well maintained and clean. We enjoyed coffee in the mornings at Roasted Bean and especially loved the coffee only line. We never had to wait more than a few minutes for a cup of coffee. We ate at Carnegie Deli and LVB. LVB was just okay but Carnegie was very good and of course huge portions. This of course is where a fridge and microwave would have come in handy but that's all Vegas hotel rooms.    the staff was very friendly from housekeeping to MLife desk to the dealers. Everyone greeted us with a smile.    We found Mirage to be a great location clean and affordable. We won't hesitate to stay again if they keep offering up those MLife and MyVegas deals.
50,this was our first trip to LAS VEGAS.We DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT HOWEVER IT WAS AWESOME.the entertainment was great-transportation service was spot on any concern was handled promptly and the staff was courteous at all times without any attitude.
30,We arrived a little early and that wasn't a issue with the pre check in option. We waited a reasonable amount of time about 10 minutes.  Upon reaching our suite I was looking forward to seeing what type of view we had I didn't notice the 10⁰ slope of the floor.. it was insane how much of a slope it had! My wife was the first to notice it and then the rest of the party did too. We filled the tub to watch the water gather to one side more than the other.. so basically you would drown while your feet were out of the water.  Our view was.. well not the greatest but it was still nice to see the lights of the strip.  We would probably stay here again just not in the same suite.  We really enjoyed the location of the hotel.
50,Outstanding service and beautiful clean luxurious accommodations. Everything at your command. You will feel pampered here. Location to the strip and airport. Customer service to please. Clean airy and beautiful
20,The mattress in room 07-034 should be replaced immediately. Entire trip was ruined by 3 nights of poor sleep due to poor sleep conditions. Would not recommend this site for that reason. On a positive note friendly staff and nice pool area. Also $20 taxi ride from airport was nice
20,There was dried blood on the sheets the first night. And bc she chose not to drink the alcoholic drinks in fridge it was locked and we had no way to have food or drinks in our rm. No coffee no microwave. For the price I was very disappointed.
30,Cleanliness of rooms definitely has room for improvement. There are padded sections on the wall and you can see the dust sitting on them. Drove me nuts. Need a good vacuum. Bathroom mirror didnt get cleaned all of the time. Elevators looking beat up. Have stayed at Mirage many times. This is the first time I’ve felt like I probably wouldn’t stay there again...
50,Enjoyed our stay while in Las Vegas at The Mirage! The grounds were beautiful with a feel of nature all around. The pantry and The Still had the best foods to me. Can’t wait for smoke free environment although they did really good with the ventilation.
50,We went for my daughter’s 21st birthday and had a wonderful time. Food was great. The gambling was ok. Pool is beautiful. Unfortunately we were at the end of the hallway so it was a lot of walking. Loved it overall
50,Could be like a mirage but indeed is real!!! in everything they show and excel!! The fountain the amazing shows outside and inside the decorations that indeed can blind even the most skeptical!! bottom line the Mirage is a clear show of perfection
40,We recently visited here for a conference.  We loved the large spacious rooms the multiple elevator banks so you weren’t stopping on every floor the large pool area and the convenience of location.    We hated the fact that you had to walk through the smoke filled casino to reach anything- exits rooms conference. Even the restaurants were open to the casino so we had smoke filling our table as we ate. The weekend was the worst. By the final day of our stay asthma was kicking in and we couldn’t breathe. We were thankful to be checking out.    We would not return here to stay for this reason. We enjoyed walking through other properties that were not so smoke filled or had access to rooms without going through the casino every time. This one was so smoky we had no desire to use it.
50,The room was spacious clean and well appointed. The access to and from the room was easy. The added security after 10 PM is well thought of. The elaborate decor is eye catching and great for picture taking. Will definitely return to stay here.
50,This hotel is still one of the best in Vegas. The buffet isnt as good as it used to be but still edible. Pool is great to relax at and dont forget to visit the dolphins and the secret garden. Rooms are very spacious and clean.
50,The 3rd MDC CONVENTION was held at the Mirage. 5000 people Strong.  Awesome Venue and Excellent Staff.  Restaurant's The Pantry and Cravings Buffet well presented and Great Food.  Rooms were Above Excellent.
50,In the middle of everything on the strip. Rooms are clean  nice and roomy. Great food at CPK and the deli. Huge sport bet area. Poker room small but nice. The show LOVE is super. Watch Vegas Vacation movie before you go!!!
50,The VIP service at the mirage is exceptional  except for our car being late for airport and almost missing our plane  but we made it  driver made awesome time ! From check in to check out everyone was so helpful
40,Great location. Casino is really nice. Love the pools here. Rooms could use updating. My toilet leaked and there was a hole in the wall. Also didn’t have a tv remote in the room but that wasn’t a big issue because we were barely in the room.
30,Rooms were high for the value  Very clean and nice beds  No coffee maker in room  Couldn't use bar fridge because it was stocked with liquor . If you touched it you paid for it  That's a shame because I don't want to get dressed before my coffee.
50,We loved everything about our stay. The rooms were spacious and comfortable food was outstanding the Beatles Love show was AH-MAY-ZING and after visiting many other properties on the strip we believe The Mirage offers the very best casino!
30,From check-in to express check-out everything about my stay at the Mirage was great as one would expect from a well established Casino on the Strip with a great reputation. My only complaint was the noises from the hallway including the slamming of every door as other guests came or went from their rooms that became very annoying. Otherwise had a great stay.
30,The rooms were less than average carpet needs a good cleaning. Very dusty. Need minor maintenance but required maintenance. Stay away from Cravings restaurant food is not very good and very overpriced for the quality.
40,We enjoyed the stay. Room was nice spacious and clean. Excellent food specifically food at the Osteria Costa (Italian) & Otoro (Sushi) and Volcano show is the attraction. The only drawback was parking fees and glasses in room were smelling bad seems like not cleaned properly.
50,Overall the hotel was very nice clean friendly staff good location lots to shops/restaurants on-site. The only thing I didn't like was that there was no courtesy coffee available in-room and the mini-frig wasn't available for personal items like drinks. It came pre-stocked and was very expensive.
20,Don’t count on the Mirage holding to your reservations and confirmations...they won’t! We came from Canada & Arizona. Booking a couple of minutes months ahead. They gave our rooms away. Stood at reservation desk 1.5 hours to finally make a ‘deal’ with the Mirage. We literally had to barter with them. It’s a gamble f you get what you paid for. This is our 3rd trip there. Two out of three times had same problems. They do not hold to the promise f a reservation or confirmation!
50,I wanted to specifically highlight two individuals Tony and Wendy who were working on the casino floor the weekend of September 28 2019. I had an unpleasant experience with a blackjack dealer which I won't go into the details for. But Tony and the team were willing to hear me out and get the details of what happened and did everything in their power to make it right. This turned a highly unpleasant experience into a great example of customer experience.
50,This is a well-rounded resort in a great location on the strip. It's smaller than several competitors but it's centrally located and has two large neighbors (The Venetian and Caesar's). It's priced lower than it's neighbors (probably because it's smaller) but it has the same class and comfort. It has a great pool and party pool and it has very good restaurants (especially Stack Heritage Steak and LVB). We can usually get adjoining rooms for a group.
30,We paid the additional upgrade fee for a higher up strip view room which had a nice view of the volcano side. The room however was dated dirty carpets dusty lumpy pillows tears to bed frame and small bathroom. Shower head was loose from wall and showed some age. The air conditioning worked well however and our room was quite so we slept relatively well. No fridge in room and no amenities like tea/coffee. The Mirage has limited cheaper dining options so we had to go outside hotel for these. We did enjoy drinks at the center bar although a little pricey. We picked the Mirage because of it's central location which was great many of the other hotels were within walking distance. The resort fees were around $40 a day which is far too high for what they offered. The pool is large we hired a cabana one day which we enjoyed and there was usually space around the pool on other days. I wouldn't stay here again however as I feel there are better hotels on the strip for around the same price
50,Can't really fault The Mirage. It's comfortable convenient and the rooms are perfectly fine. Reasonably quick check in service. Friendly welcome from the front desk team. There are plenty of places nearby to eat and the pool is brilliant. Pool side bar so you can relax and cool off with beer.
50,Had the best time at the Mirage Hotel and Casino from September 25 through October 4 2019. Scott Postner the Marketing Executive was amazing with the service and amenities provided as were the attendants in the VIP Room. Food within Cravings LVB Burgers and other restaurants was fantastic regardless of meal times. Housekeeping staff were also very good in keeping the room clean and the king sized bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I have experienced. We will definitely be returning to the Mirage Hotel and Casino.
50,Stayed at other hotels on the strip but our first time staying at the Mirage was fantastic! It's a nice hotel with great amenities. We had our 8 year old with us and there was enough to do at the hotel and within walking distance that he had a good time as well. The pool is empty right when it opened which was amazing! The only downfall is when you pay $20 for 3 bottles of water at the on-site gift shop. Go across the street to Walgreens and save yourself the money.
10,Rooms are dated and have Naugahyde headboard and ours was ripped in several spots and it looked worn out and nasty! Pillows are lumpy foam. Lamps and room carpet looked like they are from the 1980's. No refrigerator in rooms and front desk clerk said rudely to us that mini bar would be an $18.00 charge for a bottle of water! She warned us not to even use the snack items in the room as it would be a charge of $18.00. Long lines to check in and clerks not friendly. I used a debit card and was told that I could make no rooms charges! Older flat screen 36 inch TV that was mounted to a panel and black cushion wall that was not high def. Noisy people in room next door could be heard through thin walls. M life club members rewards hard to redeem as long lines and small amount of personnel working the M Life station. Hallway noise bounces into rooms loudly as door is thin. Pantry restaurant line is long and waited 45 minutes at breakfast time and service is slow and food choices are just average. Food is pricey and coffee was $9.00 per person! Cravings Breakfast Buffet eggs were cool and heating lamp was not keeping food hot.
10,We booked a double bed room for 3 people. Told them that we wouldn’t be there until midnight due to our flights. They offered mobile check in which I did. When we got there no one was working the mobile check in desk so we had to stand in line for 1.5 hours!! When we finally got to the desk they had given our room away. They offered a king bed with a cot. That was not what we paid for! They then offered a “suite” for the first night but then we would have to check out in the morning have them store our bags and then check back in to the room we originally booked. After many arguments we opted for the suite option. When we got to the “suite” it was a normal room with a king bed (and no cot)!!! I called to try to get a cot with no answer. I tried for 1.5 hours!! They never answered!! I finally gave up and the three of us slept in one bed. We packed up the next morning and gave them our bags. We had to wait until 3 pm to check in to our real room. When we finally went to that room I asked for them to bring us our bags. They had lost them!!! They finally found them and brought them up an hour later. The next morning we got up to take a shower but the shower handle was broke and the shower hadn’t been cleaned. So another call to the front desk... they actually answered this time and sent someone up to fix it and clean it. We ended up being late to our conference because of this. After all of these issues they only offered to waive two of four nights of the resort fee only. Unbelievable. Very poor customer service!!!
20,Waitresses must make their own drinks so multiple times they came back with no drink and said sorry they couldn’t figure out how to make what I ordered. Also not enough waitresses on staff. Even a coffee or a beer seemed to take forever
50,Mirage casino and hotel provides the best in high quality accommodations. Highly recommend people to stay here. Food and rooms are outstanding. The staff is above reproach. If you have any problem they solve it.
40,I was there for a convention at this location. It was all very convenient. Rooms were clean bed was very comfortable. Shower had no water pressure though. I would if also liked a coffee pot in the room. The Starbucks was available but had extremely long lines because of the huge conference that was taking place I’m sure. I would book here again.
40,Great location and friendly staff! The pool is very nice and relaxing - good drinks too! Close to the monorail as well. Restaurant choices are great! Rooms seem small and are pretty basic - need balconies.
20,A/C not working properly and even when we complained it wasn’t fixed. Also no refrigerator in room. Overpriced for what you received. Conference area was nice though. Will stay somewhere else next time.
10,Bad room was dirty smelly with cigar smell headboard was ripped and bathroom was dirty the room is too old needs improvement overall really Bad experience with my stay never had this experience before and I have stayed at mirage always can’t comprehend why mirage is not renovating their rooms
30,The Mirage is a beautiful hotel. I was a bit disappointed that no one acknowledged my birthday the pool closes early at 6 pm no one asked me if i wanted a drink while gambling. I enjoyed the Beatles show and was happy it was located in the hotel I did however meet a very nice and helpful usher at he Beatles show.
30,We were placed by the elevators and it was so noisy we never slept well also the room smelled musty and moldy. We are easy going people and never complain but we were really disappointed with the room 😔 we loved the restaurants and the shopping in the mirage.
30,KUDOS to the casino cleaning staff!! Floors were ALWAYS clean never saw any garbage laying around. Upon greeting any one of them they greeted me with politeness. Hotel needs a better ventilation system smoke from casino areas were very prominent in the restaurants while dining not a great experience.
50,This was a business conference trip with MyDailyChoice. From check in with Milly who saved us from staying on the streetbecause we had screwed up our own reservationto the staff who kept everything running smoothly thru the whole event. There were almost 6000 of us to contend with. The rooms were clean and spacious. The restaurants never ran out of food and handled us all with a lot of patience. We were able to relax and get the most out of our conference because of all these things. Also it is a beautiful place we would all stay for a pleasure trip for sure in the future!
40,The Mirage is a great place to stay while visiting Las Vegas. It is in walking to distance to lots of attractions on the strip. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The food areas are reasonably priced.
50,If I am going to stay in Vegas on the strip it will be here. The layout of the hotel and casino is easy to navigate. The rooms are really clean and they make things feel special for the guests. I have only been here for work twice but I always try to bring my spouse. They have really enjoyed the spa and time to relax. The location is better than others since it is in the middle. Even though it is older it is far nicer than some of the the newer ones. They really have kept up its modern and elegant feel. I cannot wait to stay there again.
50,Very nice . Loved our room! Had an amazing view of the strip and pool.. friendly staff. Loved the Casino as well. Beds were really comfortable. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone! Looking forward to our next stray!
50,Love staying here Located in a great spot on the strip. The pool is super great Shady and relaxing. would go back every month if I could. Restaurants and night life are great. Rooms are super clean and the staff is great!
30,You can not use the refrigerator in your room its locked. Can only be unlocked by the hotel if you want to purchase a drink from inside. They charge alot of room fees for no reason. The casino was pretty quiet not much winning going on.
20,The upkeep & cleanliness of common areas has fallen. The food at Carvings was low quality for the price. The walls inside the restaurant were dirty & badly marked up.They asked if we wanted to pay the gratuity up front and we said no which turned out to be the right choice since we never saw a waiter except to drop 2 straws to us. They now charge $25 per night for valet parking.
50,First of all let me start by stating we go to Vegas far too much (or not enough??) haha.  We've been 18 times since 2015. And 13 of those stays have been at The Mirage. Yeup its that good!!  We consider it our home base when we go. And when we do happen to stay somewhere different for whatever reason the whole time we are comparing it to the Mirage!!  The Buffet is great the pool is fabulous elevators are quick and smooth. Our only request upon check-in is always a room close to elevators...this is huge. Because that place is HUGE! You don't want to walk a mile after a night of buffet gorging and tequila shots to get to a toilet...trust me.  The resort itself is smaller in comparison to like caliber hotels (no food mall shopping is almost nil etc) but this is great in a way because you can literally get to the strip from your room in less than 10minutes easy....and you are mid-strip so commuting anywhere either on foot or Uber is hassle free.  A few changes we noticed during our last stay:  -no more unlimited alcohol included with your buffet purchase (major bummer). I feel for the bar staff as we will never purchase alcohol from them and hence no tip either!  -the pool now has 50 (at least) deck chairs for rent pool side which we wont do either. Quite a few of them never got rented the whole time we were there. Seems like a waste of real estate to me.  -they could use a total toilet over haul (swap them out!). I'm a plumber by trade and those toilets are THE WORST!! Throw in some Champions and never look back!!  That's about it for little changes.  We brought some relatives with us one trip and they as well now always stay Mirage!!  The grounds are immaculate (huge cudos to the janitorial staff......amazing).  Check-in for us is always super efficient (Mlife express always). As is check out.  Last trip was our 26th anniversary. So we told the front desk staff this (can't remember his name but he was from Modesto CA.!!) and he gave us a King Suite upgrade for $0.00 and when we turned on our room TV there was a sweet Happy Anniversary message (I know right?? wtf!!). The literally made our trip super special. Way to go Modesto Guy!!
30,The location is ideal and you are in the midst of the strip. Variety of restaurants on site. Convention center was well laid out and convenient. The hotel room should have been cleaned thoroughly. Dirty socks boarding tickets books and room keys all in there when we checked in.
50,Had a great time!! My 1st time in Vegas. The hotel and casino are amazing! Plan to attend convention next year! Hope to see a show or two on my next trip and stay. Thank you for a terrific first time!
30,The rooms are so dated and the carpet looks like it has never been changed! I don’t know if the carpet or the old wood has a made the entire room have a pungent stink when entering. The toilet is inches from the shower which is gross and it’s so many stains on the furniture and scratched wood that makes you want to not lean on anything!
10,Paid over 500 dollars for a stinky room and had a huge machine in my room to try and mask odor! When I complain to the front desk the girl could care less and when I said let me speak to somebody who cares she gave me $88 off
40,Great location clean rooms friendly staff good food beautiful flowers throughout (the wife pointed out). The only downfall is how the chairs are all lined up side by side at the pool. Nobody wants to HAVE to sit next a stranger.
30,Front desk and registration staff is poor. Supervisor I dealt with was worse. M-Life staff is confused with the exception of Karen. Race and Sports book is the best in Las Vegas. The employees make it so.
40,Great hotel and great location. Very good for families. The Pantry was a very good restaurant and the family enjoyed California Pizza just as much. The rooms were nice and clean. Very friendly staff all around. Wish there would have been more options to get a quick bite. But if you need this you can just go across the street as the hotel is close to many eating options. Loved the pool area. I believe we made the right choice in hotels for our first family trip to Las Vegas
50,I had not stayed here in a long time but it was nice to come back and very pleasantly surprised with the room the service and of course you can't beat the location. Some remodeling going on outside but not distracting.
40,The food in any restaurant was very good. Prices were very high for beer and wine. Service was very good also. Enjoyed the show and pool area. Would like to see the bathrooms updated and include a walk in shower. Used the in room safe all the time there. Would like to go again when I save more money.
50,We used to stay at another property but having seen how that is failing my friend recommended that we try the Mirage.  Check in was very fast. The room was lovely overlooking the strip and the volcano display. Only downside is no fridge available for personal use. The only fridge is a weighted mini bar. Hey ho not a huge issue.  The lobby area is decorated with fresh flowers daily which was a lovely surprise. We had just presumed they were fake until we clocked the florist one morning. That little bit of effort and money spent makes a huge difference to the atmosphere in the hotel. Big plus.  The housekeeping/maintenance staff were also a great help. The beds were just a smidge too soft for us so they guys came in and flipped the mattresses over to the harder side. Much better.  Concierge were lovely and more than helpful and approachable. Hats off to Aubrey for helping me organise a limo trip exactly how I wanted it for our last night. She is a credit to you.  Special mentions must also go to Folk who we usually caught outside calling taxis in a morning. He’s earned his retirement. He has clearly been a credit to your establishment. His fresh faced smile (and a hug) always set us up well for a day!  The pool area was great too. We paid for a cabana one day for my birthday then oasis sun lounger reservations another two days. The staff there were brilliant. Very friendly and attentive. Cannot fault the service there.  Overall we were more than impressed with the hotel. The only minor complaint is the towels and the shower curtain. There was a notice saying about saving water and reusing your towels but the majority of the time the towels were replaced when we’d tried to hang them up to reuse them over the bath to allow them to dry out was obviously misinterpreted as a request to change them. The shower curtain has two layers one to sit in the bath one outside yet somehow we’d still end up with the bathroom floor half flooded after a 5 minute shower. Design flaw or our fault not sure but not a huge problem.    Will stay again when I next get back.
40,Great stay. Beds were comfortable pool area was fantastic security and housekeeping staff were kind prompt and did great work. We love this hotel. The food is fantastic. Casino service is slow and rare but roulette staff (Sean?) and his supervisor were fantastic funny and incredibly accommodating for a green gambler!!! Great trip will stay there again smack dab in the middle of the strip. We love the mirage.
40,The mirage is an extremely busy hotel with large bedrooms and high quality bathrooms. Shopping compared to other hotels is fairly  limited but restaurants and snack bars in the foyer are good. Staff are professional in the American way although everything moves so quickly that you don't get to talk to them much. Be sure to take credit card to be registered at reception. This seems to be common practice in vegas. I'd go again!
10,Had a elderly guest who needed a wheelchair due to the long walk from lobby to room Waited more than half hour and decided to physically assist my guest to her room. Front desk stated they called security for the wheelchair but upon following up with security they had no knowledge of request. Had to go to a different floor for ice. Stayed at King Tower no coffee maker. Was charged 18.00 to for removing the bottle water from the weight activated stand tried to resolve with front desk that it was only moved they said the charge still stood. Many other Vegas hotels that treat you like a guest. The Mirage room was clean but room not even close to other Vegas rooms for the price
50,This is not our first stay here but it has been a year or so. I love staying at Mirage. Everyone is so very nice polite helpful and respectful. The casino itself is older but very clean. The signage is easy to read and there are always helpful people to direct your way. There are no timeshare people in your face at every turn. The rooms are comfortable and the bathroom is large with great counter space. The pool is a good size. There are lots of chairs in the sun and in the shade. The buffet is amazingly great especially for the price. The location is perfect....center strip.
40,Very friendly safe great location pricing is right. Get the volcano view if you have kids its worth it for the nightly show from your room. The food choices and restaurants are fantastic for the whole family. one of the best nice upscale hotels on the strip that caters to kids as well.
50,Friendly staff clean rooms and plenty of gaming options. Good restaurant choices in the hotel. Centrally located on the strip to make it easy to walk anywhere. The pool is fantastic as well. We have been coming here for years staying at various hotels. For the last 5 years we have stayed at the Mirage based on our first stay experience.
20,The room and casino are showing age. While comfortable the in room chair was faded. The bathroom was meh. Still I want to be clear the front desk service was great and I had no problems with personnel.    The casino is showing age too. The poker room drink service was non-existent and basically the days of free drinks while gambling are done here. 2 hours at a craps table and I got a single beer.    The Clark Griswald Mirage is not around anymore and I’ll honestly say the Mirage needs the Park MGM treatment.
10,Very disappointed in how run down the Mirage looked. It lacked energy and service and the hotel seemed short staffed throughout every department within the hotel. At one time this was my favorite hotel on the strip however I won't be returning.
50,Mirage rooms was clean and comfortable had a room overlooking the volcano.Bed was comfortable. Housekeeping was great. Casino was great Terry Fator was spectacular have to see. Location was great close to everything .check in was less than 15 minutes. Mirage is the place to stay
40,Typically my husband and I stay at the Bellagio however we tried the Mirage this time because we got a great deal on a suite.    Things we liked:  - mobile check in  - ambiance of the entrance  - short walk to Venetian and the Wynn  - suite was very nice  - concierge was great  - front desk assistance for Mlife members was great    What we didn’t like:  - elevators were slow we were always waiting for one  - security to the guest elevators could be better only at night and not very secure  - service on the floor in the morning was almost non-existent to get a free cup of coffee  - would only extend my check out time 1 hour I asked for 2 due to a late flight  - line for porter to hold bags was ridiculous. Took over 30 minutes.    All in all would most likely not stay here again.
50,Great staff great selection of stores and things to do at the mirage. Club....not as well to be honest. The other hotels definitely have better clubs if that is what you're in to.  Either way highly recommended hotel.
50,From the front desk to the baggage handlers cleaning people bar service all were exceptional. I cant say enough good things about how we we’re treated. And I also work in the service industry an it takes alot to impress me. Well Done!
50,My friend has never been to Las Vegas. She was surprised by the rumors of the city being sinister and unruly as she did not find that all. She really enjoyed the experience at the hotel and for her culture said she would spread the word.
50,We stayed here on our family holiday. It was central to everything so we got to see a lot of Vegas by walking which is a lot of walking.  The rooms were huge clean and comfortable. Check in was easy and everyone here was very friendly.  It's a big place so expect crowds.  We had breakfast in the bakery downstairs and it was great blue berry pancakes with maple syrup yummo!!  There is a very long walk from the lobby to your rooms so be prepared.
20,This was my first stay at the Mirage. The lines to check-in were incredibly long the hallways had garbage on the floor parking was charged $12-$15 every time you go in/out and on day of checkout someone from housekeeping barged in my room without knocking while I was changing my clothes. Overall my stay was just okay but I prefer not to stay here again.
40,Just got back from a week's stay at the. Mirage . Good hotel in a good position on the las Vegas strip . The hotel was very clean and comfortable and the staff were excellent . The only complaint would be the lack of tea and coffee and a fridge in the room . I think for the price you would expect both of these ...
50,Came to Vegas to get married and stayed at the Mirage. Second time staying there and I’ll definitely be back. The Mirage is beautiful and we had a wonderful stay there. They have a beautiful pool and great rooms.
40,I really liked this resort except for the too-high resort fees. It's a very nice place for business conference gatherings. The food provided at the conference (breakfast and lunch and snacks) were all top notch. I really liked all the catering for the conference event.
50,Solid choice on the strip. Location is the best. Good food options and a great pool. We have been coming to the mirage for over 20 years and it still delivers. Yes the rooms show a their age but they are clean and neat. The public areas are updated and the size and layout is very manageable. Do not hesitate to book here!
50,Staff was professional and timely. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Easy to get in and out of. Convention hall was exactly what was needed for a successful conference. I recommend going to The Still and enjoying great food and drink with exceptional staff.
50,Great location easy to walk to everywhere else in the area. The rooms were clean and comfortable the staff was friendly and accommodating. Gym was clean cool temp and good options of equipment. Pool and outdoor bars beautiful. I’d stay again.
50,We took the volcano view room. Very spacious room with a comfortable bed. The food served at the 24 hour pantry was of good quality with decent options for vegetarians. Perfect location and the volcano show is worth a watch
40,My wife and I stayed for 3 nights here at the Mirage. We had a very nice stay. The staff was professional and very helpful. Our room was clean and well maintained. The one issue in the room was the A/C never got the room as cool as we wanted. It was cool but we wanted it it very cool. Our first day we tried the buffet and weren't happy at all. We had to try the buffet on our last day due to time issues this was a Saturday morning. We both were pleasantly surprised. The food was hot and actually tasted very good. The location is amazing and you can't miss the volcano!
50,I joined Trip Advisor in order to share my experience with our trip to Las Vegas and how wonderfully we were treated.    While we stayed at the Bellagio for our trip to Las Vegas we started out at The Mirage. I am in a wheelchair so my wife booked us an accessible room with a lift. When we arrived we found The Mirage has just one room with a lift and it was still occupied by a guest who had been there for a week and was not going to be checking out for another two days.    Justin who is the Hotel Operations Manager for The Mirage came up with a truly awesome arrangement ... he managed to get us some rooms at the Bellagio. The room we had booked at The Mirage had two queen sized beds which my wife my son and myself were going to share. The Bellagio's lift equiped room has a single king sized bed so Justin booked two rooms for us ... the one with the lift for my wife and myself and another room also with a king sized bed for my son. And he comped it. Justin helped turn what could have been a terrible experience into something really nice. To top it off he even paid for the taxi to take us to the Bellagio.    The property itself was very nice ... the sapphire glass aquarium is really cool and a section of the aquarium is devoted to Finding Nemo clownfish :) When we arrived there was a long line of people waiting to check in but the line moved along pretty quickly.    I will cover the rest of our visit to Las Vegas in a review for the Bellagio but I really wanted to express my appreciation for how we were treated with a situation which could have turned out badly.    We did watch the Beatles Love show by Cirque du Soleil and it was fantastic. My wife is usually blasé about live shows but even she enjoyed it. The sound system is awesome the Beatles' music is classic Beatles tunes and the gymnastics are what you would expect from a Cirque du Soleil performance. Very very well worth watching. For people in wheelchairs it is completely accessible and they make every effort to include you.
40,The Mirage has always been my favorite Hotel in Las Vegas. It's not too big and I love the tropical feel. The pool is probably one of the best in Las Vegas. Prices have really gone up (like everywhere in Vegas) and feel that it's getting out of control. Beatles Love is an awesome show. Restaurants are good overall.
40,Good location. Disappointed that we had only one bath towel and one washcloth. Great that they held luggage before flight. Allowed us to check in early.Cost to check out early is high. Resort fee is high. Restaurants are good. Would stay again
40,Mirage was great! Beautiful pool staff was extremely friendly. The Pantry restaurant was very good but the buffet was just average. Definitely overpriced for all food & drinks. The only thing bad about the room was there was no coffee maker & no fridge. I have never stayed at a hotel without a coffeemaker. Overall it was a great stay & would stay here again.
40,I had very nice stay for our trip to hear the Eagles in concert. The rooms are quite large in comparison clean and comfortable. I had some trouble sleeping because of noise from the hallway caused by an unknown source it sounded mechanical. The restaurants are very nice and the food was quite good. I will be back.
40,The beautiful pool is one of the best features. The hotel seems more compact than other Vegas hotels so you aren’t walking a football field to go from one part of the hotel to the next. Nice selection of restaurants from casual to more upscale but don’t look for Gordon Ramsay here. Skip the buffet it’s a pass.
50,I visited the Mirage for a 24 hour business trip. I arrived at 11 PM and left 24 hours later. Everything went smoothly -- check in and check out were extremely easy; very comfortable and clean room. No problems!
30,First time stay at the Mirage - started with a lukewarm reception at the front desk. No upbeat smiles I think that said it all. Asked about upgrade was even prepared to pay....but to say a hotel of that size was 'fully committed' ...really?? I don't like the bs just because it's a bit of extra work.    Restaurants are nice service in one was very slow - the other was excellent.    Took lots of walking as the hotel isn't mid strip but I knew that when booking.    Wouldn't 'not' book here again but I think there could be better options and I've definitely encountered friendlier staff.
20,We got there around 11 pm and We booked 2 queen beds at one night and We would book another night in the next day .  In the morning We found out that one of luggage handle was broken how !!! Which bell boys did that ? My hubby got so pissed and we went to the reception counter and told them .    One of the front desk started laughing at our complaint . That was very rude and bad manner to laugh at customers like that .  How did he get a job to be a receptionist at the front desk ?    Finally we went to Front Office Bellboy and Keith Kase who solved our problem very well .  We were so happy to see Keith Kase .  We will be back to this hotel again because Keith Kase .
50,Great location great staff. Good base of operations for a stay in Vegas. Near the center of the strip. Gambling is good with a good mix of table limits. Food choices here are pretty decent. Overall a very enjoyable experience.
50,This hotel has been renovated in recent years and is in excellent shape. Although it doesn’t have the elegant air of some other hotels its staff more than make up for it. Well trained and just nice people.
50,Had the opportunity to enjoy a fun birthday bash with my brothers. We were able to stay at 2 nice hotels. It's amazing how good a hotel could look if someone puts their mind to it. Inside this hotel was lots of things to do and so much fun to be had. Most importantly the rooms were laid out and plush... AWESOME!!
30,I decided to stay at the mirage because of the conference i was attending and boy was i disappointed. The rooms are just old and rundown. The bed and pillows were very uncomfortable. If it were not for the good restaurants and the beatles show i would rate the mirage lower
50,The Perfect Vegas Hotel  I've stayed at the Mirage many times even after trying out different hotels in town. I love the pool the service the dealers my host the restaurants and the casino. Everyone is so friendly and this place attracts a slightly older crowd with a fun cool vibe. I'll stay here again and again!
30,Room was very worn with much needed repairs. Windows to the strip were very dirty. Staff was not friendly or helpful. Pool area was always dirty and the water was very chilly. Little staff at the pool as well. Not many restaurant offerings. It was our second visit and both times it was lacking.
40,When staying the room smelled like wet carpet. It wasn’t terrible to really complain but it was weird. We had two rooms and our other room was perfect so I’m sure it was just a weird fluke. Anyways the hotel is pretty nice. Casino is pretty nice. I loved the dolphin habitat. We did the VIP tour and got to feed train and pet dolphins. And take a picture with one of them.
20,Booked the Mirage as this was the conference hotel and I thought it would be easier. Forgotten that 4 years ago it was already +- and a very impersonal hotel. the key cards worked more not then they did (and were faaaar away from reception on 22th floor) The hotel needs a good clean up/ overhaul. Cleaning crew is there a lot but when run down you can not expect better result. Connecting door (not needed by us) and windows let you hear everything outside your room. Paid over $300 per night for 3 nights including resort fee which does not really do much. Nice pool areas and towels provided (hence the fee).  Had buffet breakfast and not good value for the money especially watery coffee. the 'restaurant' is dated and not very nice to sit. the pantry breakfast is much better.  Bar with waitress service early evening was great experience for a group bar late at night : bar lady clearly counting to go home.  Sportsbar is nice area to hang out. very impersonal.
50,Great location first class hotel and pool good video poker payouts friendly staff good choice for food options. The Terry Fator show was great and a good family choice for everyone. The Beatles show for those who love loud Beatles music with lots of flair.
20,We had a 2 for one and even then it wasn't worth it. Beer and wine no longer included but that is not why we didn't like it. Scrappy crab legs far fewer selection than others we visited and the made to order pasta didn't include basic tomatoe sauce with beef.
50,When you walk into the Mirage you are entering a respite from the bustle of the rest of Vegas. Contrary to the spend spend spend mantra everywhere else mirage keeps that in check replacing it with a gorgeous conservatory and well-planned design. That's not to say that shops aren't available as they are but it's not the forefront.The pool is phenomenal and allows you to find your own little nook. I'll definitely consider staying again if I'm ever in Vegas again.
40,We have stayed at the Mirage many times.while it is a nice play to stay I think there costs have got a bit too high. The food is good but again too costly. The slot machines never seem to pay out any winnings.
30,Another resort that gouges resort fees very nice place for its age friendly staff volcano show is great surprised they don’t have a fee for that too other than that it’s a great old property make resort fees optional
10,I’m come to Vegas 6-8 times a year. I stay at various resorts based on best deals but I prefer to stick to MGM resorts for their players club.    I wanted to stay at The Mirage because it was up the strip from the other MGM resorts that I stayed at top of the year and it looks really fancy & nice. Boy was I wrong!!!!    The only thing at The Mirage that is fancy are their prices. I was treated better at NYNY MGM Grand and other resorts that are more gimmicky and all around cheaper.    The room quality is no better than anywhere else in Vegas. I even paid $30/night extra for an upgrade to a Tower Deluxe room and it’s jo better than a regular room but it has a bathtub... big deal! The toilet doesn’t work right and the WiFi doesn't work at all!    I have been to the Front Desk every day three times a day since I arrived 3days ago and nothing is better. Now they charged me for early check in which they told me twice I would not be AND I still can’t charge anything to my room for some reason.    Oh.... and the best part I noticed my credit card has been charged almost $400 at The Still pub/restaurant for no apparent reason.... yes I was there twice on that day.... $120 tab frost visit. $95 tab the second yet I show charges and voids all over the place netting $400 charge to me when it should be closer to $215. They clearly manually entered the charges and probably over tipped themselves.    2 more days left to be here and I am SO stressed out by the treatment I have received by The Mirage. Waiting to see how bad they mess up my hotel bill too...    I have been to 4 other resorts this year so far and they ALL treated me better than The Mirage. So sad. This is how they treat their Platinum Tier customers!!!    If you want my opinion stay anywhere but The Mirage save some money and get treated WAY better in every way.    You should enjoy your vacation not worry & be upset every minute on how the hotel is screwing you.    #MirageSucks. #BadVacations
40,Disclaimer: We were comped two nights and paid for the third.    For the price point the Mirage delivers. We usually stay at Cosmo but we couldn't pass up two free nights and a low third night price. Despite being on a comp we were upgraded to a tower resort room with volcano & strip views. Our room was clean and in good condition.    On our first day (Saturday) we utilized the pool. By 9:00 am there was a huge line of people waiting to get in. My advice is to get there early if you want chairs right on the water. The pool is huge- it looked like there are plenty of seats. From the pool day we grabbed some food at the Still and started gambling. There were decent minimums for a Saturday night. The sports book was action packed for all the college football games too.    In our trip we used the fitness center (3 stars) and ate at Carnegie Deli (huge sandwich!) and Heritage Steak (surprisingly good!). My husband and I are foodies and we felt that the Mirage really lacked in quality breakfast or lunch options. (We avoid chains and buffets when we can.) The fine dining establishments closed early (10 / 11 pm) on Saturday so we were disappointed to not eat after a show at the hotel.    All in all we enjoyed our stay and had no hiccups. With the comps this was a good stay!
50,First time I am staying at this hotel and it is a great choice! The room is very comfortable and stylish. The king bed is so cozy. The lobby atrium has lush landscaping and is very beautiful. The location is central and walking distance to shopping restaurants and many sites. The Forum shops are next door and Fashion mall not too far away. There is a 'volcano' show in the evening at the front of the hotel. We ate lunch at California Pizza Kitchen and there is a wide selection of restaurants at The Mirage. There are many activities here but we didn't try them. The standard $41 daily resort fee provides wifi pool and gym access. I didn't try the pool or gym.
50,Outstanding service central to everything staff seems to really care. very nice pool. Great assortment of dining choices and abundant amount of gambling options. I would recommend this hotel anytime watch the volcano eruption at night.
40,Great hotel pool was awesome the Beatles LOVE show was outstanding..... poker room was cut in half from last time. Only complaint was prices have gone way up. Drink prices at pool and bar were silly. Room was nice spacious and comfortable. We had a great time just wish prices were more reasonable.
50,We had a great stay at the Mirage for 4 nights. Stayed on level 10 (signage a little confusing at the elevator intersection - looks like lifts needed to go to 10 are for the spa on 12). We were in a room with 2 queen beds! Plenty of mirrors! Our stay included $50 credit for the room per day (not incl. checkout day) for bars and restaurants. We used that credit for drink and the buffet - one day early for just breakfast and the other day breakfast moving into brunch (so you get the lunch options too!). Buffet was great!  We took advantage of the available poker machines. There’s a few convenience stores for snacks and necessities- a little costly - find the CVS down the road. We watched the volcano show - hourly I believe of an evening. Hotel is in a great location to wander the strip to other hotels shopping and bars. Happy to recommend you stay here.
40,tickets to the eagles concert were very good also so were the rooms and food the pool was clean and warm the live entertainment in the lounge was excellant and we will definately be staying here again
50,Have been staying at the Mirage for the the last four trips to Las Vegas and the staff never disappoints! Our Contact Celina always has everything under control She is extremely helpful and is always looking to make sure our stay is top notch.
50,I greatly enjoyed my stay. The rooms were very spacious and clean. The staff were friendly and helped me navigate my way around. Many food and shop options and the show The Beatles Love was excellent!
30,Last minute decision to see the Beatles Love show so booked a groupon at the Mirage where it was playing. The show was fantastic but the room was a disappointment. It was dated and didn't look clean especially the carpet and bathtub.
50,Every time we step foot on the property the entire staff seems happy that we are on there property. You go into some other properties and they are like HoHum. We will continue to make the mirage our property of choice
30,This hotel is in a great location and just the right size. The rooms however are tired and need a refresh. Staff is friendly but for the price the rooms should offer more. The toilet is the old style low one and the carpet and bedding old (been at least 8 years since they have updated the rooms). Still a bit smokey but improving with less gamblers smoking now.
40,Stayed for a week and had a great time with a friendly staff and general overall facilty cleanliness. The pool was in great shape and though the lounge chairs were side by side with no space in between them it worked out.
50,We had a great weekend trip to the Mirage. We had none of the issues that were discussed below. It is all in what you know and what you should and should not have to be charged. Everything was comped with no problems. I think most people want a free trip without doing anything. MLife is still the best rewards program around.
40,Very nice trip to Vegas with several couples. Casino staff and waitresses in the sports book were fantastic. Hotel was very clean rooms were spacious and beds were good. Overall this hotel is an excellent property and we would stay here again.
50,Loved our room at the Mirage! Service was great the room was quiet which was very surprising considering it was on the strip. Parking cost per night but it was very worth it given we could park at other partner MGM hotels which was awesome. We weren't aware of a resort fee which included access to wifi and other basic amenities but apparently this is standard for all hotels in Vegas. We paid for a strip view room but weren't given one upon check in. Called and requested a change and were easily accommodated the following night. The line for check in was very very busy. We waited for over an hour. Definitely recommend doing Mobile check in to save yourself some time. Room service was absolutely delightful! We've never had food that tasted this fresh and delicious being ordered at 3am so a big thumbs up to this.    Overall an awesome stay. Cannot fault anything really. Will definitely stay here again!
50,Excellent location  crosswalk right in front of Mirage .Restaurants in the Mirage are all excellent. Pool is great. Casino is good has a lot of newer machines. Room was clean & had nice decor we would definitely stay there again.
50,Although I had to wait 25+ minutes at11:30 PM to check in the check in person provided excellent hospitality and accommodation! She went out of her way to make sure that I was put at ease and also consulted with her superiors to upgrade me!
50,We arrived at 11am. No check-in lines. Front desk was so friendly and helpful. Allowed us to check in early. Staff was incredibly happy and helpful. Main pool was gorgeous. Food was delicious. Best salsa and guac I've ever had at the Dolphin Bar at the pool. Buy the Mirage souvenir cup. Let them fill you up with ice water in the morning and take it with you all day.
50,We love the location. Everything is close by. The hotel rooms are quiet clean and fairly priced. Great places to eat right in the hotel. Excellent pool area. And you can't go wrong booking tickets to the Beatles.
50,I attended a conference at the Mirage September 23-27 and my husband came along so we had a wonderful couples get away. The conference facilites were beautiful. Our room couldn't have been nicer cleaner or more comfortable. The food in every restaurant was amazing! Only thing we found out we are horrible at black jack!
40,It had been nine years since my family had had a vacation since the passing of my husband. My children and I agreed to have combine a birthday/vacation in Las Vegas and the Mirage offered good pricing location and pool. We very much enjoyed our stay and hope to not wait another nine years to return.
30,In my opinion the Mirage is a nice hotel but is in need of an upgrade. If you are expecting it to be an oldish hotel then you will be fine. But most of the bad reviews are from people who are expecting upscale or even in style furnishings.    In my opinion we had a nice penthouse suite room. We did think the room had a foul smell a few times. The pipes in the tub were gurgling and that was when we had the smell. After the second time it happened we closed the tub drain and filled the tub with a little water. We also closed the sink drain. We thought that helped.    The room was very big as was the bathroom. It was just like the pictures I saw in the internet. The maid kept our room very clean and we were very happy. But again it was dated. Yes you could find fault if you looked. Grout missing. Stains on floor. couches in living room in our opinion not comfy. But overall it was ok. It was clean and spacious.    We knew there were no coffee pots so we bought a cheap one from home in our duffle bag with coffee creamer and sugar. we checked this bag on our flight so it wasn’t bad. We also knew that water was very expensive and I being on medication we knew we would go through a lot. So we had our limo driver make a fast stop for beer soda and water. The bell hop took it up to our room with our luggage and a ten dollar tip.    The elevators to the suites were fast and no wait.    We had myvegas rewards for cravings buffet. My opinion was that it was the worst buffet in my life. I thought everything was gross. Again just my opinion. Others had no problem. The only thing I ate was macaroni with red sauce. Couldn’t even find a dessert that looked good. I would never go back.    California pizza was ok. Nothing special but was good for a fast snack.    The pantry room service was not good for us. We had a few breakfast deliveries. It comes in a shopping bag. It was NEVER hot. Always mediocre. One time order was completely wrong but they did not charge. Taste of food was good but they need to deliver hot food.    The pool was extremely crowded. Chairs close together. Same as all the other resorts.    Overall the spacious room is what would make me go back. Maids kept room extremely clean which was important.    Safe travels!!!!
30,Disappointing strip viewsaw more roof topssides of buildings and pool than strip. Room was older in disrepairupholstery fadedwood chair arms chippedheadboard with puncturesshower head green/crustycover falling offdresser draws sticking difficult to open.  No coffee pot in room for what you pay really? Don't touch anything in fridge or on top unless you want to pay $18.00 for water or candy
50,My boyfriend and I were so glad we picked the Mirage! Perfectly located in the heart of the strip tons of restaurants a GREAT scenic pool tons of amenities and a beautiful room.    100% would recommend the Mirage and would return! I'm super picky about hotels wary of cleanliness noise levels and safety as a young woman travelling. Zero problems here. I'd done a lot of research and was not disappointed! Mirage is everything I wanted!    Perks:  * Clean and quiet rooms!  * Buffet was busy but we NEVER waited [in August]. Great food selection/quality for all meals of the day. We tried almost all the restaurants. Not one bad experience  * Beatles LOVE show is here!  * Spa was beautiful and relaxing! Great service amazing facilities  * Hotel had EVERYTHING you might need for your stay  * This is a great hotel for ANYONE: there were families with kids bachelor parties seniors young couples like us friends. The crowd mix was exactly the vibe I wanted.  * The pool was clean HUGE and felt very much like paradise. TONS of seating. TONS. It did get busy in the heat of the afternoon but we still always found a chair or two. Not that you even really want to sit in the chairs in August anyway it's too HOT. Lifeguards seemed diligent about moving unoccupied chairs. Free clean towels. Bathrooms on deck.  * Casino floor was fun. And much less smokey than I was expecting. They've got a great air filtration system that's not too heavily perfumed.  * Staff were friendly and helpful --from cleaning staff to management. Very well managed!  * Mobile check-in was super easy and quick. There's still a staff member to assist you if you run into trouble so you don't need to join the long queue for regular check-in. We did it on our phones and used a computer which dispensed our room keys. EASY!  * Great AC in the hotel and in the rooms
40,The hotel and casino was serviceable. The room was nice. We did have a issue with the shower draining slow. The pool was nice. The pool bar was expensive. The hotel is on the opposite side of where the monorail runs. It was my first stay. My wife did like it. If you are going to just gamble this might be the one for you.
50,Highly recommend. Great restaurants pool casino entertainment and location. Quick walking distance to shops and other entertainment. Will definitely stay here again. Only thing is don’t touch the water or snacks in the room highly over priced. $18 per water!
50,We were at this facility in January and loved the shows location casino options and being so close to the strip. The Beatles show and Terry Fator were excellent and the staff courteous and helpful to our family.
50,We stayed in the one bedroom Lanai. They have just been remodeled and are very nice. The private pool is very nice also. The staff couldn't have been nicer. The hotel is very nice and not as noisy as some of the others. The waterfalls in the lobby are a breath of fresh air. The rooms were very clean and the fridge stocked with non alcoholic drinks.  Nice but very expensive
20,You need to remodel your rooms and bathrooms. Mirage has a great reputation however I was very disappointed this trip. I hope you can change my mind next time I come in I got married here 26 years ago and very good memories from the past
30,Stayed at Mirage due to conference i needed to attend.  Cons: Gym is not 24 hour located inside a store hours are very limited.  No fridge or microwave oven inside the room need to pay extra fee if an extra fridge is needed.  Overprice water nuts. Go to nearest Walgreens across the street for cheaper water.  We watched some shows during our stay (at Miracle Mile Shops-Planet Hollywood) went to ABC store water are reasonably price.  Limited restaurants    Pros: They let you print boarding pass for free!  Conveniently situated between Treasure island and Venetian!
10,One of the many overpriced hotel with shabby carpet and bad service and extremely overpriced food.  If you have a choice dont go there.  I went there for a convention and regretted it.  I did electronic checkin 1 day before and requested a room on a high floor near the elevator.  After checkin was completed their computer system told me that they will send a room number by email - it never did.  When we arrived at 11 PM we were told that our room is on the lowest room and farthest from the elevator - literally the last room on the wing.
10,It took two hours to get checked in and our bags to our room.  Mass confusion on how to get checked in.  Worst check-in ever!  You have to walk a mile to your room.  Pool is not family friendly. Closes way early.  Nickle and dime you now for everything. Even in your room.
30,This is first time booked the hotel thinking I will get best facilities for the price. Coffee machine is missing.  View of the room which is promised is volcano or pool view but provided is back view .
20,whole first floor and then even around the pool was smoke or smoke smell coverup- which is just as bad. room had no refrigerator and cost of bottle of water in downstairs store was 7 dollars. Walgreens across the street was overpriced but only 3
30,Stayed at the resort the week of Sep 22-27 2019. Been going to there for many years. While the staff there has always been excellent the best I feel the hotel itself has been in decline for several years now. It seems they are either putting off or just not doing routine maintenance and upkeep of the property. It's a shame because I remember when it was in better shape. I've stayed at other properties on the LV strip Belagio Wynn. Much nicer. Still keep going back to the Mirage though loyalty nostalgia I don't know.
10,$37 resort fee $15 parking and they charged us $20 because we touched cans in the fridge trying to make room for a drink we brought with us. They said they would reverse the charge but I haven’t seen it come through yet.
10,front desk will laugh at you when you walk away because you complained and speak when things are wrong. sports bar ran out of flavored stoli vodka and wouldnt go get a bottle told me to go to another bar rude rude rude
30,This hotel has aged more than I had expected the rooms had a smell to them and looked run down. Not all the staff was friendly and one day I called the desk for an issue and was on hold for 20 minutes I finally had to hang up to get ready to leave.
30,Paid for early arrival and received the low ball room at the end of a long hallway. I found the room to be small for 3 people. There was also the issue of the broken tv and a plug hanging out of the wall. I was very disappointed in the quality. The conference was great though.
50,Mirage always go above and beyond to make our stay great. Looking forward to another 12 years of being a dedicated customer. We love staying here hoping this helps someone to have the greatest and most comfortable time while in Vegas.
50,Rooms are clean beds are comfortable and the views are amazing and location to die for. We always have a fabulous time in the Mirage. Spencer a host is amazing and looks after us wonderfully. The friendlinesss and helpfulless of the staff is unbeatable!! We stay in the Mirage every year we come would not stay anywhere else now. Try it!!
30,I expected something a bit better not just so boring hotel room I experienced in smaller hotels in the middle of nowhere and with few stars. Bathroom was so small hospitality at reception poor. And AC was too strong.    The only thing I enjoyed was pool with bar and great coctails.
30,Be aware the rooms are old bed/mattress need to be replaced. Cost was high for value received! The shower had mold and cracked tiles. I did not ask to move because I was only there for 2 nights. Recommend staying at a newer hotel for this kind of money. Also the air in the casino smells bad....really bad!!
40,Spent 3 days 2 nights at Mirage and I gotta say this is easily one of favorite place to stay in terms of location staff overall theme.  Be careful about booking Lava View rooms though. It is kinda hard to see Volcano from certain rooms as they have light build emitting in your direction from the top of direction.
40,Overall a wonderful stay and location on the strip. Note worthy front desk staff were more than willing to help in anyway possible. Very accommodating with early arrive and even with the check out experience was excellent. I would recommend this casino for any traveler
50,I've stayed at the Mirage quite a few times over the years and it's still a very solid Hotel on the strip. This time we took my 16 month old so it was a little bit of a different stay but overall we enjoyed every bit of it.  My daughter is enjoyed the pool as did we and even though Vegas isn't exactly for kids it was still a fun time for us all.  Things I did notice this time around was coffee in the room wasn't available granted there is two coffee shops in the hotel.  But one thing still is definitely for sure the mirages location is one of the best on the strip. We definitely had a great time!
50,Wonderful hidden gem that we found with such friendly waiters and amazing food for the price. We had the Gnocchi and salmon which was cooked perfectly. The view was phenomenal of both the town and the sea. Highly recommend.
50,My Wife and I had an awesome experience at the Mirage! We really enjoyed hanging out at the main pool which is usually one of the main things we like to do during the day. At the Mirage you are able to bring your own drinks into the pool area as long as it does not have any other Las Vegas companies labeling on it for example I couldn't bring in my really large plastic daiquiri cup i bought off the strip. You can bring in beer cans etc. This is a really nice quality that resort offers unlike many others like Aria or the Flamingo not allowing you to bring any drinks in. We also spent a couple hours at the Bare Pool Lounge and that was relaxing. Only go there if you are looking for a more intimate setting as it's much smaller of a pool area and also women can be topless!
40,Our first impression of The Mirage was a four star hotel but a five star resort.Check in took a while as the staff confused our reservation with our son’s who was checking in at the same time but had a different room option.Our rooma Stay Well Kingwas spacious overall although the bathroom with its old fashioned combined bath and shower was surprisingly small.Having said that we loved the rest of the hotel with its excellent facilitiesrestaurantsbarsshopshuge pool area and of coursethe casino.Of the hotel restaurants we triedCalifornia Pizza Kitchen and Osteria Costa were our favouritesboth very good plus the Roasted Bean for our morning coffee.This was our first visit to Las Vegas and we were totally blown away by the whole experience.We certainly plan to return in the future and The Mirage with its great location would be our first choice.
40,Nice hotel but expect hotel room price to almost double with taxes and other unsolicited add-ons. Volcano neat. Take your swimming trunks. Go across the street to eat hotel food very expensive. See Terry Fator show.
10,3 check ins at front desk with 40 people waiting. 1.5 hours to check in. Gave me a view of the my room over a steel roof. Then bathroom tub was rusted shower head you could not move. I could not use charger for my phone it would heat up. Toilet was so low you could sit on the floor.
20,2nd time being at the hotel travelling from the UK. hotel is fabulous and central to everything you would need.  Came back this time to see that the hotel has taken £470 out from my account and after a phone call to them I was told it would be in my account within 7\10 days.....didn't happen. Went onto their web page and emailed twice to them and received an automatic email back saying the hotel would get back to me within 7\10 days....didn't happen!!!!!  I am now going through my CC company to retrieve the money which saddens me as I love this hotel and was planning to go back next year to it.......not going to happen. I'm sure other hotels will be just as good and not rip their customers off and well maybe have better customer service
30,After having heard some positive things about this hotel i was quite exited to stay here.  Unfortunately didn't really live up too expectation. I found the room quite small and the bathroom really cramped with a fan that had little or no effect. Fridge is weight sensored which is also very annoying.  Mirage is nothing special. Spend your money elsewhere.
40,Pools were great service at the pool was very quick.  Seemed like the hotel was short servers in the casino as you waited quite awhile for drinks to come.  Very clean hotel everyone was very nice for sure
50,This hotel is nothing short! Amazing and comfortable rooms beds and entertainments was great.. it’s in the middle of the Strip and close to everything. Would definitely recommend this too anyone. Especially for my first time to be next malls bars.
50,We had a great time from start to finish. You pay resort fee daily but you can use some it as a credit daily in the restaurants or bars in any MGM hotel. We used the credit for breakfast in the pantry which was great. Probably one of the best pools in Vegas.
40,Just came back from 7 nights at the Mirage some business and some pleasure. The good news is that the Mirage continues to be a good solid premium hotel/resort strategically located in the heart of the Strip. It's location makes it an easy walk up to Venetian and Palazzo to the North and Bellagio to the south.  Aside from the location what I like about this resort includes the table minimums often being as low as $10 and the ample variety of slot machines. Casual on-site restaurants of California Pizza Kitchen and Carnegie Deli give a reasonable respite to more expensive eateries both inside and outside of the Mirage. Room rates also tended to be more reasonable vs. it's competitors Caesars Palace The Venation Bellagio and Paris.  What I didn't like about this resort is that the décor has become sadly old and dated and the entire hotel needs a refresh. They are methodically updating the guest rooms however they did not get to mine yet. Be sure to inquire when checking in. My room featured old and beat up furniture a closet light that did not work a tv that while new did not function properly and I had to call 3 times to maintenance to get a service person up to fix it. Also needing a refresh is the buffet Cravings and even the long standing show LOVE seems old and out of place. I had seen LOVE ~10 years ago and it really hasn't changed much.  Overall it's a nice hotel and nice place to stay. I would definitely consider staying there again.
30,Stayed last month for 4 nights in a standard room hotel has a great location however the bed was very lumpy and the pillow was non existent very flat. Bathrooms are very tiny and there is no room to sit and do make up ( ladies stay elsewhere the lighting is not good at all and you most likely have to sit on the ground on a pillow or something to do your make up in front of the wall mirror as the toilet in the bathroom takes up a lot of space!! )    Location is key but the price for what I received was a bit ridiculous maybe they were almost at full capacity during that time and raised their rates?    All in all I could have paid $300/per less and had a better stay at Harrah's their rooms have been renovated. Mirage needs a major face lift probably will not return as there are many other options.
50,The Mirage is a beautiful Casino with helpful staff. It is in a prime location on the strip with shops all around. You can catch the monorail right across the strip at Harrah's. It has great restaurants. If you can only go to one nice place do the Osteria Costa. You will not regret staying at this property. Get a Stay Well suite and prepared to be amazed.
50,Went for a birthday trip with my daughters and this was a fantastic place. everyone was nice and welcoming. the food was good and everything about the Mirage was great. I will be back again for another stay
50,Stayed with my wife and granddaughter. We loved the room. I thought whoever designed did a great job. My granddaughter went to the see the dolphins and tigers at the secret garden also had lunch at Carnegie deli. my granddaughter loved the aquarium at check-in and the person checking us in made her feel important. My wife and I took turns in the casino and love it and the overall feel of the Mirage. We'll be back.
40,Staff is not friendly (front desk concierge and bell boys). Other hotels in the area have newer buildings and better prices. Pool and convention center is ok. Rooms are great. Casino staff is friendly.
20,Smoke filled cavern. You walk in from the parking garage and don't encounter too much smoke on the 250 yard walk. After checking in I used the mobile check-in and it was very quick I had to walk another 200 yards 50 of it through smoke filled casino to get to the guest elevators. The guest room floor I was on was smoke free. The walk from the guest elevators to the meeting room was about 500 yards the first 150 through a smoke filled casino.
50,Had a nice Vacation at the Mirage!  Ran into a problem the first night but the problem was solved for the remaining 5 Nights. The room walls are a little thin. We could hear people on the phones talking in the hallways and it sounded like they were standing outside our door!
50,This was my first time staying at the Mirage. I had a great time here. The location was perfect within the strip so everything was no more than 10-15 minutes walking distance. The staff was very professional and helpful throughout the entire casino. I loved the Rhumbar as it offered a very nice patio and entertainment with great drinks. I will absolutely revisit this hotel and possibly upgrade my room and utilize my M Rewards.
20,Wecl recently stayed in aone bedroom suite. Check in was quick and the staff at the front desk were helpful.The room was very spacious well maintained and clean.We were on the 28th floor and the view was of the strip and pool.    The main pool area gets very busy and if you want a seat you need to be there no later than 10.30.Food and drink service at the pool is very slow and expensive...but that is Vegas.    Now the Pantry service is what lets this hotel down.A limited choice of foods to select from.    We ordered dinner from the Psntry prior to going to a late show.When our food arrived the person delivering the food had a bad attitude was not happy that I had not opened the door at the first knock. He requested that I retotal the bill and add the gratuity. I understand it is customary to tip in America however due to his attitude I declined to do so. It is also not the hotel policy to tip.    Five minutes later an in house phone call was made to our room where I was verbally abused by the caller for my action.    The incident was formally reported to management who are currently investigating the serious breach of security by staff and the verbal abuse.    I would not recommend this hotel as it took me a number of calls and a personal visit to management before I got any positve action from administration to follow up and investigate this incident.
10,1 - You don’t have an exhaust fan in your bathroom the fan cover fell off and it was obvious that it wasn’t venting to anywhere.  2- There are tiles that appear to be coming off the wall in the bathroom. There’s human hair on the ceiling of this same bathroom.  3- there was stains on the chair in the common area rendering the chair useless.  4 - The other two chairs next to the table did not match.  5 - We were in room 2045 Which is next to the stairwell where employees and or guests smoked causing the smoke to blow into our room.  6 - I was extremely disturbed by the fact that your staff wanted $40 a day for a refrigerator so you guys could conserve energy. However you guys felt the need to put a refrigerator completely stocked with overpriced items in our room which was pulling more energy than it was worth. If you were truly worried about conserving energy there we wouldn’t of been a fridge in there at all.  7 - I feel like I should mention that your staff was very friendly and the main floor of your casino area was nice.  8 - We've traveled extensively over the last several years staying in many hotels renting houses directly on beaches etc. and I truly feel that the overall quality of this room was overpriced.
40,"Located on the beginning (or the end) of the Las Vegas Strip and 10 minutes cab drive from the airport (as almost all hotels on the strip).  The Mirage is an excellent hotel I've stayed here twice and both times very enjoyable. My first time was over New Year's Eve(2009) and I came back last year for the Rock'n'Roll Marathon. It is one of the"" family-friendly"" casinos on the strip as you won't see nudity on lobby's screens. Also adult entertainment is hidden at the far end of the hotel.    Room: CLEAN and spacious with very comfortable beds.  Bathroom: Decent size with good water pressure!  Entertainment:  1/ Cirque du Soleil ""Love"".  2/ Volcano eruptions: Every hour from 8.00 pm-midnight.  3/ The Siegfried & Roy Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat."
40,This hotel is fabulous!! Great location on the strip. The pool area is my favourite among the 4 hotels I've stayed on the strip.  4 girls sharing one room and the room was big enough....double beds were nice and big.    The only downside was the housekeeping. Didn't empty the bin nor change the bed sheets when we asked. I also had to ask the housekeepers one day for towels as they had left 2 in our room.    Apart from the hotel perfect hotel
20,I have stayed at several hotels on the Vegas strip but this was my first time at the Mirage. The hotel overall is beautiful. My room was well appointed and the view of the Volcano was nice but it does get a little noisey during the eruption. The food was slightly above average but nothing to draw me back.    My issue was the staff and security. I am in Vegas about 5 times per year and the unfriendly staff at the front desk Pantry and CPK restaurants even the casino floor were far below the standards of an MGM property. Because of the staff I will not be staying here again.    Security was friendly but I don't understand why they have guards at the elevators after about 10pm till 7 or 8AM but not during the rest of the day. I was there during the shooting in 2017 so I understand and appreciate the guards but why only at night? Other than the cost I can't come up with a good answer.    In short stay at the Aria MGM or if you don't want an MGM property the Cosmo the staff there know how to smile and provide great service.
50,Excellent all around. Courteous and helpful staff at every turn. The food at the pantry was fantastic. The spa staff was great and the massages Andre also amazing- a great way to relax and de stress. Looking forward to coming back
50,We had a great time. The room was clean. The location was bad the highway noise kept us up. The stores at the Mirage did not have what we were looking for. The Mrs. forgot her cover-up over her bathing suit at the mirage retail store there were none and we were told they do not carry them. Were at other hotels they had them. But in all we had a great time.
50,"Great experience as usual for the Mirage just took forever to check in. However to their credit after about half an hour of a slow moving line we were able to check in at the ""preferred"" customer desk. My wife played video poker while I was in line and got 4 Aces."
50,Wonderful casino and atmosphere. Great rooms and casino. Wonderful food options. Dolphins and white tigers amazing. Have seen Love before... a must! If your playing blackjack...look for dealer Tony V. The best!
50,We had a wonderful time especially in the private oasis pool! Staff is amazing and down to earth. The casino was not crowded. Bonus... we actually won money on the slots!! Absolutely coming back! What a beautiful hotel.
50,First time staying at the northern area of the strip. I really enjoyed my stay at the Mirage. All the staff was very friendly food options were good casino was fun location on the strip is great because it's much closer to the street and other properties (you don't have to walk a mile to the next casino). Will probably stay there again in the future.
50,This was a great experience. Siegfried & Roy's Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat makes the hotel magical with a baby dolphin that was born there recently. The restaurants was also great. I can recommend that you stay there.
40,I arrived early in the day and went off to explore Las Vegas. I had done the mobile check-in at the hotel but never did get an email from the hotel to let me know that my room was ready. When I checked with the front desk in the evening I was told the mobile check-in didn’t work because my type of room (king bed) was not available. I was put up in a handicap accessible room for one night and they let me change to the room that I originally wanted the next day. For my inconvenience they removed the outrageous $37 resort fee on my first night. The rooms were very nice and quite clean. The bathrooms are a bit small and it would be nice to have a refrigerator in the room (instead of the minibar). I loved how there was never any long lines or waiting at the elevators like I have experienced at other high rise hotels.
30,Be prepared to get your coffee at a pricey restaurant and there is no refrigerator to put your leftovers from your restaurant dinner and if you are planing to spend time at the pool get there early. It fills up very quickly. Staff and service are wonderful. Location is on the strip.
40,A classic property where you can enjoy a Las Vegas trip quite satisfactorily without leaving the hotel. Rooms are recently redecorated and the standard rooms are quite comfortable although the baths are small. Our favorites for dining on property are Stack where the rotating menu always is prepared innovatively and the flavors are excellently blended. For breakfast Carnegie Deli is quick and service is excellent whether you want a burger and fries or classic deli egg preparations for breakfast. The California Pizza Kitchen at Mirage is great for lunch dinner or late night. Shows The Beatles Love and Terry Fator never disappoint.
50,My vacation stay at The Mirage Hotel and Casino.has been extremely relaxing starting with the lovely swimming pool to the comfortably warm hot tub. The restaurants served good tasting food and the housekeeping associates were very helpful and kind. The front desk staff most respectful.and helpful. Check in and out was an easy process. Thanks for a great stay. I'll be back again.
40,We go to Vegas twice a year and most always stay at the mirage.  Lately we have noticed some rebuilding of the casino games. Hopefully this is finished quickly and they get back to the wonderful place it has always been.
10,To pay $200 a night plus a $30 per night resort fee and not include a refrigerator and coffee machine in the room is outrageous! In order to use a refrigerator you have to pay an additional $35/night or provide a valid medical reason to use it. You are only paying to be center strip next to Caesars and for nothing else. The property itself is very old and so are the rooms.
40,Great location for walking anywhere on the Strip. Very friendly and accommodating staff. Large rooms. Lots of dining choices. Very convenient conference facilities. Elevator configuration is broken up into sections of floors making for faster service.
40,"We traveled to Las Vegas for the first time for our 30th wedding anniversary. The Mirage was recommended by friends who stayed last year and are going again in November. The location on the strip is excellent! It was very easy to get around everything being very well marked. We stayed in a King strip view room. It was nice enough but somewhat dated. Could definitely use some updates; however was very clean and comfortable. The pool area was beautiful and service was great. However we did not appreciate that most of the loungers in shade were only available for price and had to be ""reserved"". It was very hot! There were many choices for dining. We ate at the Osteria Costa excellent Italian cuisine; Cravings Buffet...a bit expensive I thought but lots of selection; California Pizza Kitchen delicious; the Pantry also delicious; We booked The Beatles Love by Cirque du Soleil at the last minute it did not disappoint! We also went to Gabriel Iglesias who was playing at the Mirage. We purchased tickets before we left as we are big fans. He was awesome I haven't laughed that much in a very long time. We also went to see Absinthe at the recommendation of a friend it was very entertaining definitely not for the faint of heart or if you are easily offended. The acrobatic acts were top notch! The highlight of the trip was the helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon with Serenity Helicopters; our pilot Mike ""Mad Dog"" Davis was excellent and so knowledgeable! A true character! I highly recommend this company. The views are breathtaking our heads were on a constant swivel. Overall the trip was amazing and would stay at the Mirage again."
50,Beautiful casino friendly staff a variety of places to eat and a spectacular pool area. I was here on business but I would return for pleasure too. It was a very nice hotel. I recommend the pineapple punch by the pool. It was delicious 😋
40,We rented one of the hospitality suites at the Mirage. The room was spacious (two bedrooms three beds and a large sectional couch for viewing the TV and a large table with chairs for those early morning discussions.The casino/hotel is centrally located on the strip for shows and fun. It has a number of nice restaurants and bars. Our favorite was the Rhumbar which has both an indoor and outdoor seating. You can enjoy the volcano as you indulge in cocktail and/or cigar. The Beatles Love show is reasonably priced with excellent performers and music.
50,The room food and location were all excellent! We got into our rooms early after a long flight which was greatly appreciated by the whole team. Staff was helpful and friendly. The food was great with a lot of choices within the hotel!
50,My husband and I have been coming to the Maroge often on for 20 years. We’ve seen many things change on the strip and the Maroge is one of the Constance that we love to go back to. It has a very open field to it so the smoking does not get to us as it does in many of the other casinos. The staff is exceptionally friendly and the layout of the casino is very easy to maneuver. The sports but could use a little bit of updating but other than that it’s amazing!
50,Perfect location especially when youre not experienced with Las Vegas. Enjoyed the pool! Casino was perfect size- not too big not too small. Good food options. Service was great. Will be coming back to visit!
30,I did enjoy the Mirage hotel room itself since it was huge! However there was a filled minibar that is touch sensitive while I wished there was a plain refrigerator. The WiFi connection was extremely spotty and frustrating!
50,Trip was to see Eric Clapton live at T-Moble arena. We have stayed several times at the Mirage and every stay has been excellent. Not sure way I would need 200 letters to tell you we had a good time and enjoyed our selves.
50,Excellent room staff table play dealers pit boss location and food.  I will return and highly recommend to anyone visiting the strip. Wasn't there long enough to take advantage of all of the amenities but I will stay longer on next visit.
50,If you are looking for comfort cleanliness and quiet the Mirage is for you! Ive stayed at other Strip hotels that tend to be too large and too flashy. The casino floor was manageable the walk to the pool did not require a compass and a map and the rooms were QUIET!!
50,Nice hotel centrally located on the strip. Staff were awesome. Nice room. Nice pool but get there early for a chair. Large casino. Food is expensive but is everywhere on the strip. This is the second time we have stayed and will stay again when we return.
40,My stay was pretty decent for the most part but beware the toilet in my room was low and when you flushed I had a gust of air blow up my you no what so I just wouldn't flush until I got off and closed the lid my view wasn't good I was at the far end of the hall but overall it was clean worth the price and the bed was comfy I would stay here again one other small issue the ac to ling to explain that but it could of been better
50,"Very nice & clean hotel. Staff was friendly & professional.  The hotel is very convenient from having entertainment  being at the strip restaurants & essential stores. It also has a nightclub & a ""secret"" garden of dolphins."
50,Highly recommended. Staff was extremely helpful and facilities were top notch. This is the perfect place for a quick getaway. There is something to do for everyone (kids included). I will definitely be returning soon. Also ensure to sign up for M life rewards nothing better than getting rewarded for vacationing!!!
10,Not being comped when they say the room is covered then charge you for the room plus for 3 bottles of water for 60 dollars. Take money from me then lie to me about a comped room. Negative rating from me...
40,Our stay was very comfortable and the staff was kind and very professional we would like to return but this time with our kids and enjoy the pool and do more family activities so we hope we can get a better rate the following trip we make .......thanks
50,My kids love the pool. Love how close the pool was yo are room. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Will stay there again also will recommend to other people and drinks are great at the pool and service too
50,Great hotel it has everything you could need - great looking for the outside with the large Beatles posters and a cool volcano show. Inside there is small shops to buy beer restaurants and fast food stops a large casino which gave us a couple of wins! It is also home to the Beatles LOVE Cirque du Soleil - HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
40,Not the newest largest or most upscale on the strip but friendliest staff and great food choices. Always made to feel welcome. Central location is great for exploring venues and trying some of the varied restaurants available in LV. Some of the best you'll find anywhere.
30,"My wife and I have been to Vegas many times. We remember the days (not too long ago) when you could drive up to park a valet would take your keys you would tip and go inside) Gone are those days with $24 a day fees the norm now. (noticeably the parking lines were WAY down from before.) We chose NOT to tip for parking as we had paid handsomely for it.  You ask ""why did you go there?"" Alas my wife wanted to see the Terry Fator show. That has begun a few months earlier when we had purchased ""half-price"" tickets to the event. By the time we paid for the tickets and MGM had added fees for service and taxes and other stuff the tickets rose back over the regular prices considerably! (thanks once again MGM! Keep those tourists coming back)  We went to the M life desk to redeem two rewards we had for a dinner buffet and two tickets to the Secret Garden. The young lady Cindy who assisted us was the jewel of the entire experience. She went out of her way to help us in all our redemption efforts. She was as dismayed as we were when we found that the hotel (since the time we had booked the buffets on My Vegas) had blacked out this date because of a convention. AND even though all the info on our Secret Garden tours was correct the system would not all the issuance of two tickets. She even put us on the phone with Mlife direct but that was another story and 30 minutes on hold.  So we had planned to come early to the Mirage to see the tigers and dolphins (and bears oh my) but that didn't happen. And no coupons for buffet so we decided to forge ahead and stay and gamble awhile and pay regular price for the buffet.  We sat down at a machine and my wife was waiting to order a glass of wine... and she waited and waited and waited. after 20 minutes she asked one of the floor managers for help. He said he would make sure someone would come by soon. So we waited and waited and waited another 20 minutes... and finally my wife grabbed a waitress and simply asked for a drink. the waitress informed her that this was NOT her area but she would tell the lady who was in this area to come by. So we waited and waited...and finally a waitress came by... with a huge attitude. We got our drinks (my wife always tips generously for every round) and then we waited and waited and waited. Good news was i got up about $75 dollars but don't expect good wait service here as this happened to several folks we talked to.  So we go and paid full price for the buffet got our receipt to go in we waited and waited... while standing as we stared at an empty buffet room with maybe 10 tables seated. we finally asked the lady in charge what was going on. She informed us that a lot of tables were reserved for a banquet... and so we waited and waited and were finally seated. The food is good but not awesome. Average fare for the Strip but over priced at $34.95. We ate our fill and then went to the show. Terry Fator does and excellent job connecting with the audience and is super funny. Very current and up to date with his comedy and doesn't bow to the altar of PC!  We left having a good time at the show and went to pick up our car. paid the $24 and drove off into the night.. Leaving the Mirage in the rear view mirror.... where i plan to keep it!"
50,The hotel as a whole is amazing staff are very polite and helpful when it came to finding the box office to purchase the tickets. The layout of the hotel was beautiful.    We saw Boyz II Men in the Terry Fator Theatre it was a show to remember! This hotel hosts a lot of shows/concerts so I'd recommend seeing one!!
30,I asked for a room near the elevator as I don't want to walk too far but didn't know that it would be noisy. Just couldn't sleep as people that came off the elevator would talk loudly and our room was 7-091.
50,I highly recommend the Mirage for your stay in Vegas! The rooms are clean and very nice. The location is perfect right in the centre of the strip! The food choices on site are all great and the pool is fantastic!
10,Let's start with the staff are incredibly rude and unhelpful. The rooms are outdated and everything is worn out. The matresses appear to have not been changed in decades the TV is the size of the laptop I am typing this review on (maybe a bit larger) THERE ARE NO CHARGING PORTS NEAR THE BED. I have stayed in Hampton Inn's and beyond and can say this was the first hotel without any place to charge your phone next to the bed. The nearest charging port was an outlet and USB across the room.    The rooms are clean (I think) but very musty and old.    The level of unfriendly staff is almost comical. They all appear to hate their jobs and you as a guest.    Piece of advice there are equally as budget friendly hotels on the strip please check them out before considering the Mirage.
50,It was good in general food location the crowd such a good time in the pool good service And such a great food especially the drinks The only problem was the parking and whoever was in charge was so rude.
50,It was our first visit at the Mirage hotel it was very clean smartly laid out convenient to get around in a great location on the strip. All the restaurants had tasty food all the staff that we found was extremely friendly and everything was nice and clean
30,Rooms were outdated but clean Staff was very friendly. Restaurants are awesome Needs an update soon or drop prices. Lighting was not very good in casino area. Ventilation was poor compared to other casinos as well.
50,We would definitely stay there again. The pool was our favorite spot and we loved the frozen yogurt. An excellent place to eat in the resort would be Otoro and California Pizza Kitchen. The casinos weren't over crowded.
40,This was the second time we have stayed here and we would still stay here again.    Good - The casino is clean and the staff are friendly. The room was low priced for the week booked and one of the nicer we have seen. I rate higher for a good bed and I slept well. Location is in the middle of the strip and is an easy walk to shops and shows.    Bad - the price for parking is high even if you are a guest. We were charged for bottled water we did not use but it was taken off our bill when we noticed it. Mobile check-in did not go smoothly and we had to go to lobby to clear it up before we got our room.    Pool was beautiful.    Elevators are fast.    A 4 star stay could have easily been a five star but the few issues dropped it down.
50,So many choices but because of alot of things(#1your people)i would never stay anywhere else in vegas but the mirage!!feels like home and see the same staff year after year tells me it's a great place to work too
50,Super friendly and very accommodating ! The staff is great ! Rooms are beautiful we had the volcano view and it was such a great experience . The pool is so beautiful we had such a great time . Housekeepers are so nice as well
40,My husband and I really enjoyed the room. The space was very comfortable and relaxing. The check in and check out process was simple and fast. Our favorite area was the pool. It was spacious and we were able to get a seat when we went down there.
30,I came here because a buddy was getting married by the pool. Unfortunately somehow I had an extra charge for roughly $100 on my room from the pool. I did not charge anything from the pool to my room and am extremely disappointed that somehow you guys let it slip through the cracks.
50,The only real issue was that our original room had a strong mold/mildew smell when you first walked in. But they moved us to another room same floor near family immediately. Front desk was very good. Otoro Japanese had excellent food/service. The Pantry had very good service/food with it being very busy. The buffet was pretty good & had a large variety. The LVB Burger Bar was very good as well. It’s a beautiful hotel inside the front the volcano the pools. There’s big cats & dolphins. Good kid spot!
40,We like Mirage because it’s a very clean hotel. We enjoyed the pool in the day and walking around was nice. The restaurants were decent except my husband got ill on the Carnegie deli sandwich. The room was nice except our fridge was broken. We let them know as soon as we got there but no one ever came to fix it.
20,Sensor on room mini bar and snacks is a joke. You will be charged for unopened items and not be able to get a hold of anyone for a refund. They just want your money even though you’re paying them a ton already to stay there...
50,The pool area is beautiful. We had breakfast at the pool area service was great. LOVE is awesome. Italian restaurant was very good as well. We only stayed on night so I really couldn't shop but they looked great.
50,Location is great.  The staff was fantastic. Alex at checkin was very friendly and knowledgeable.  The staff at Cravings was super! (So was the food!). Very knowledgeable about gluten free needs!  The staff at Pantry was great too!
20,Needs serious updating and more and better food choices. Ac didn’t work right. Bathtub stopper wouldn’t work. Bell boy could care less my knee went out and I was in tears from pain. Didn’t even bother to get me a chair. Had to wait 15 min for security to bring wheel chair.
40,Only complaints I would have are slow check-in lines and the a/c in our room worked but we set it at 65 and it was probably never lower than 70.    Guest services were amazing from my host to floor casino attendants to wait staff. We never had to wait long for a cocktail while gambling. My group was treated exceptionally well for the duration of the trip.
20,We are platinum members and brought the family out to stay at the Mirage as it was close to an event we wanted to see. I understand this was a free stay but do something to make me want to return! The bathroom was old outdated and covered in small hairs. I reported this twice to housekeeping with no resolution. The hotel elevators to our floor hardly worked many people switched elevators over our stay and it was never fixed. I get it is free but I will never stay there again.
50,Great hotel check in was good and so was check out our host Rebecca did what she said she would do and make our trip more than enjoyable I don't know how anyone can give a bad review on the mirage because it is a great place to stay Waitresses came around with drinks all of the time never had to wait bed is to die for
20,Average stay but would recommend going somewhere else. The lines are long to check in and out. The room was clean but offered very little amenities. In my opinion location would be the only reason to stay here. The people that worked there were nice though.
50,The Mirage location is great for attending shows eating relaxing by the pool or visiting other nearby hotels and casinos. Rooms were very clean and the bed was very comfortable. Staff was very friendly and helpful.
10,I am here for a conference. The convention center is beautiful. The smoking in the casino was off-putting and unpleasant. But none of that is why I am writing. The guest room is the essence of any hotel stay. The very least a guest should be able to count on is a CLEAN room. The bathtub has mold/mold stains and needs refurbished. There was also a big long hair on the door.
40,This property s turning 30 this year I have to say that it’s still looks very good. The overall public areas look great. The casino had carpet being replaced so the ongoing upkeep is good.    The room overall rates a three IMHO. The bathroom was small. Very small. I don’t like bathtubs and this tub was shallow. Watch the shower curtain as it’s easy for water to spill out onto the floor from an ill fitting shower curtain. Also no air in the bathroom. The room fogs and heats up quickly. The worst thing was the toilet. I don’t think that I have ever sat on such a low toilet. I think one could give birth siting on this thing.    The bed was very comfortable and the AC worked great. Very friendly check in staff. Overall it may sound that I did not enjoy the room but I would stay here again in a heartbeat.
10,Coffee on the room service menu for $15 + service fee. No continental breakfast. The bed was so soft I could hardly get up after the third night. Cheap pieces of soup instead of soft liquid soup.  No mouth water. You have to purchase this at their store for $8.99 for a travel size mouth water. Terrible place!
40,The hotel itself was very nice. Was a bit disappointed that I could not use the refrigerator for personal items. They will rent you one for $35 per night though. Also a bit shocked at the prices for the mini-bar items ... $15 for a small bag of M&M's ... WOW!
50,"Perfect location to stay on ""The Strip"". Easy walking distance to everything if you can stand the heat :) We not gamblers so this review isn't based on the gambling side of Vegas. We love the ""Go Go Go"" feel Vegas offers. A true smorgasbord for the sensors. Room was clean and comfortable. We don't touch mini bars and in the case of this one its just as well we don't. If you disturb the mini bar in any way (to put your own water in the fridge) you are charged a $50 restock fee! With that being said great ice vending machines on each floor fill a bag pop in the bathroom sink and put your water bottles in there to chill. Awesome breakfast/brunch buffet and well worth the cost. Overall a great stay at The Mirage Hotel & Casino."
50,This is my 4th stay at The Mirage and I just love this place. The pool is wonderful very tropical feel to it. Lots of healthy plants inside and outside the casino. The all adult Oasis pool is perfect if you want to avoid kids have an umbrella and a padded lounge with thick towels. It cost us $90. between the two of us but was well worth it. When we arrived at the pool on our first day there were NO available lounge chairs at the main pool. If we hadn't booked the Oasis pool and pre-paid we would have had no where to sit/lay and NO shade!
30,The Mirage in itself is not a bad hotel. However it is badly in need of a full refurbishing of the rooms and the bathrooms. We had to wait half an hour to be able to check in which obviously dis not put us in the best of moods. Unless the hotel gets its act together we will not return. For the same price you can get much more modern installations. Having said that the Beatle's Cirque du Soleil was magnificent.
40,I thought I would update my review since Sept 2017. We gave the Mirage a second chance after our stay in Sept 2017. We gave the Mirage a chance in Sept 2018 and the cleanliness of the room had greatly improved and it had been updated. I also stayed March 2019 and we just returned again from a trip last week Sept 2019. I love the size and location of this resort. Check in actually has been pretty easy and the agents are very friendly just the express check in seems to have a few issues.
40,Had a great time this trip. Spent better part of a day by the pool which was nice. Location of casino is great as it is walking distance to most other casinos. Spent time playing at the Mirage and walking the strip sightseeing. Staff at the Mirage was friendly and professional.
30,I felt this hotel was just fine. I was here for a meeting and thus by-passed the casino and show features of the hotel. The room was large nice desk area nice amenities. I had a view of the huge pool. after weeing the roofs of some other buildings. But there was no coffee maker nor pen and paper.    One feature I really enjoyed was the Carnegie Deli. My first evening I got the scrambled egg (with potatoes hold the toast) for a late dinner ... it was good for 2 other meals!    The location is great. There are Walgreens and CVS nearby and also a Denny's. I walked everywhere.
30,I don’t know why people love this place. It’s average in every way. Long check in line. Crazy course through the casino to get to the elevator. Room that was supposed to have a Strip view actually had a great view of the roof (strip in the distance). Annoying weighted minibar without prices and no way to use refrigerator for your own stuff. No coffee maker so you are forced once again to meander through the casino to find the Starbucks ( again long line). The only good thing about this hotel is the Beatles show. The Aquarium behind the front desk is nice too.
50,Absolutely love the smell inside the Mirage. Always clean fast service and helpful staff. Location is perfect for walking everywhere! Casino is not difficult to navigate and the walk to your room is short. Pool is awesome though they changed the hours so it opens at 9 if you're not part of the elite club. That worked out fine too.
50,Staying at the Mirage is always a great time. The pool area the spa the dinning selections and of course the night life makes for a carefree fun and exciting stay. The staff is always great and we like the fact there are so many things to do within walking distance. It is a great place to stay.
40,Long lines at check-in. I tried their check in app on my iphone but after several tries I gave up. Got to the hotel and had to stand in line to check in for about 30 minutes.  They only had three people at the counter. Beware when booking most of the hotels charge a resort fee that adds to your room rate. We did get a $50 credit toward eating at their hotel restaurants. It was very convenient as we attended a show at the Mirage.  Would stay there again
40,My stay with the Mirage was great.. the room for accessable room was perfect for my father that is in a wheelchair.. My only complain was the check-in process with all the deposits that are required to use the fridge that is already in the room but locked. For back up charges for the ridiculous amount for snacks and bottled water. I was so confused by the time I was checked in and on my way to my room.
30,We have just returned from a weeks stay at The Mirage Hotel. The hotel on arrival is very impressive and so is the cue to check in! It took an hour to check in and get our rooms this after 10 hour flight and the joy of getting through customs is as you can imagine a lonnng day!  The extra room tax is expensive $209 per room- we had 3 rooms! Ouch! And then to find out the fridge and mini bar are has a sensor and if we put anything IN the fridge we would get charged! Cold water is a must in Vegas so was really unimpressed with this. The staff expect to be tipped! So take extra money just for this otherwise you will end up with a very rude waitress who questions why you haven’t tipped and called us ‘unbelievable!’ This was in the Italian restaurant in the mirage safe to say we ventured out to eat for rest of the week. Staff in local restaurants are a lot more polite.  Vegas itself is unreal and I would highly recommend visiting other hotels.  This hotel was clean but nothing special.  For the cost you could get a lot more from a hotel.  Check out cue takes just as long so make sure you leave enough time to get to the airport.  Volcano show at the mirage I would say was the best thing about the hotel. But as I say other hotels have their perks so nothing special compared to the other hotels.  The Michael Jackson cirque de solar show at Madelay Bay was amazing!! Highly recommend.
30,Mirage is an okay property. The staff is friendly and there are a variety of dining options. The location is great for business - walking distance to Sands Expo. The sleeping rooms are comfortable but nothing special. Small but clean bathrooms.
50,Had to get away for a short vacation from hectic summer. Love the Mirage as great central location on strip. Outstanding service at all levels. Great food experience and a little fun gambling ! Fantastic Pool !
40,Location great - right on the strip. Rooms expensive and food in hotel expensive. Better off eating across the street at McDs for breakfast. Carnegie Deli massive amounts of food - if you're going to order think about sharing. Inside hotel for dinner Costa Italian restaurant. Expensive but good Basically if you want to stay at the Mirage be prepared to spend some money. The staff was exceptional but their billing system leaves something to be desired - very confusing.
50,We had a great experience with all areas of our stay people we very friendly check-in was very easy rooms were nice bed was super comfortable everything was great!! We will definitely stay here again!
50,We loved our trip to Vegas. The Mirage was in the perfect location on the strip. Their restaurants were all great! Loved the pool. Rooms were nice. It has everything we needed. Will definitely stay here again.
50,Mirage is my favorite Vegas hotel considering everything (location price amenities layout). They can do more work installing some sound dampening wall panels in the restaurants. The service has consistently been above what I expected.
40,We love the pool at the Mirage the best on the strip. The Mirage has great restaurants and gaming. The slots need some updating but the shows food and shops are enough to keep you entertained. The Atrium is beautiful and the Volcano show is always a must show to see. We watch it every time we stay here-going on 36 times.
40,Clean environment great service. Great location. Food could have been better but service was great. Would definitely stay at the Mirage in the future. Looking forward to our next trip non-business to the Mirage.
50,Awesome time and great experience at the Mirage. Staff were super friendly and courteous. Heritage steakhouse was delicious. Concierge made our stay complete with with great advice about the town. Kudos to you all.
50,Loved everything about The Mirage. Great central location friendly staff nice room nice pool good entertainment on site nice variety of restaurants nice decor unbelievable erupting volcano. Right next to The Forum Shops which are amazing. Will definitely stay here again and definitely choose The Mirage over The Bellagio.
50,The Mirage Casino & Hotel is a great place to stay with clean spacious & comfy rooms that always makes you feel like your at home while staying in a tropical resort in the heart of Las Vegas. We stay here 1-2 times a year now for over 4-5 yrs now & find the casino fun & clean with a great assortment of friendly attentive staff in all areas of the resort (i.e. Casino staff registration desk staff VIP lounge staff concierge staff bells desks & all restaurant & bar staff). The music is always upbeat & lively giving you that real party & tropical resort feel.    We would highly recommend staying here & visiting if you haven't yet.
30,The check in was a horror story. I paid for early check-in and tip the girl $50 and never received early check-in. Disaster. The pool is one of the best on the strip if not the best. Service was fantastic at the pool and always an enjoyable time. I had to beg to restock the mini bar which is ridiculous. Also the system was down for 24 hours which caused an inconvenience. The buffet has chairs and tables from the 1970s. Uncomfortable. On the other hand the food was good no matter where you ate. It is conveniently located which is also a plus. Up in the air if I'm staying there again
50,This was my third stay at the Mirage this summer. We enjoyed terrific service a beautiful swimming pool a beautiful room although the bed is a little hard for a side sleeper like me. But the rooms are quiet and this hotel seems to attract a little more mature crowd. Not too many people hooting and hollering down the Halls at 2 a.m. to wake you from your sleep.
30,My wife and I have been coming to the Mirage the week of Labor Day usually for a 7-9 day stay for 25 years and this year was a very disappointing experience. It all started when the pool hours changed to 9:00 am ON Labor Day. It is still very warm at this time in Las Vegas. The pool hours usally don't change until later in the fall. It seemed as different people talked to the pool manager they were all given different stories. I think I heard at least five. I think the best one was that Nevada passed a new law that once your pool is open all your life guard chairs must be manned. This didn’t happen until probably 11:00 am or so. There was no advanced notification of the pool hours changing so it was very scary waiting for the pool to open on Labor Day. People did not know the hours were changed so everyone was there early and security was not very helpful in keeping the peace and people in a proper line they said we had to go to the front desk to complain. The website still said 8:00 am. Maybe a note on the website stating hours would change on 09/01/19 and a sign at the pool the night before inside the lobby doors stating that pool hours were changing would have helped a little bit. I would also suggest having the platinum sign out earlier to help avoid some of the confusion/congestion. I am still disappointed in the change of hours. Kathy Carl and Lee were very good at making announcements and keeping the line in order while most of the other security guards would just sit at the desk and not move. I know to some people it is “just a pool” however I think the pool is part of what make The Mirage “The Mirage”.  I was also disheartened to find numerous chairs that you had to pay for this year. I don’t understand this because there are already two pools that you have to pay to get into. This has taken away chairs from guests who would have normally sat there and made them move other places not to mention taken away the total available chairs at the pool which are in high demand anyway. We have seen these chairs vacant on several occasions during our stay.  The pool and pool area did not seem to be as clean this year as it has been in past years.    On another note we went to the Roasted Bean as we usually do for lunch to get a sandwich and they said the needed to charge me $1 for a glass of ice water. I can completely understand charging me $1 if that was all I wanted but I was buying food spending $9 on one sandwich. The person could not understand this. I can go to any restaurant anywhere and get water with my meal. This was not listed on the menu sign that ice water is $1. Then in the middle of the week all of a sudden they want to see my ORIGIAL ID in order to room charge. I don’t bring my original driver’s license to the pool I bring a copy. It is an exact copy in color no different than my original except for being a copy. I could laminate this and the person would not have known. You can still look at the picture see it is me and compare the name to the name on my account. She said there was fraud. If someone is going to perpetuate fraud they are sophisticated enough to have a fraudulent original ID also. There was no advanced warning of this and if my wife did not just happen to have her wallet with her because the room charge was not working all week at The Blizz I would have had to trek all the way back to my room in order to get my food. I told the person we were in yesterday and the copy was fine she said the policy changed today. Maybe she could have said the policy changed today I will accept the copy because it was not known in advance but please make sure to bring your original tomorrow.    I have seen a subtle transformation over the years since MGM has taken over from Steve Wynn and I feel they haven’t been in the right direction. The hotel industry is a customer service industry and The Mirage customer service doesn’t seem be the high quality it used to be.
40,Stopped in Las Vegas Mirage hotel end of May/June 2019.Great hotel with good bars eating places and buffet.The room was very spaciousexcellent beds and a great bathroom with a shower that had good pressure.The location of this hotel is excellent for mid strip.There is a bus stop for the Deuce right outsidefor the faster SDX you must go to either Fashion Mall or Bellagio travelling southbound.Northbound you need to go to Paris or Fashion Mall.The hotel is connected to Treasure Island next door via a free tramfrom there Fashion Mall is a short walk Northbound once you cut through the hotel (Treasure Island)Also there’s a handy CVS next to Treasure Island which is a great general store for drinkssnacks etc.  Back to the Miragedon’t forget to see the Volcano eruption which is@ 8 &9 pm every nightbest viewed from the hotel lobby side because the strip gets very busy.The Mirage pool area is excellentlovely gardens and plenty of good sun beds it has a large shaped pool with water fall.Drinks are a little expensive water is available at several areas for free.Overall a a great stay and I would definitely stay here again. MGM hotels rock !!!!
50,The Mirage has always had a great staff. From check in to check out any help needed is always there. Many choices of excellent food and drink. Great shows also. Location is close enough to walk to other interesting sites on the strip.
50,We really enjoyed our first stay at the Mirage. Rooms are large clean and look nice. Pool was great. Food was expensive but tasted really good. The location of the hotel was nice for walking the strip. We will book here again. Terry Fator show was great.
50,Bare is always a great time heritage and stack are phenomenal! The mirage is really a one stop shop and it makes it hard to go check out anything else in Vegas!! Cause everything is right there at your fingertips!
20,We just stayed here for our wedding and I don’t believe we will be back. It started with three of our guest waiting in line almost two hours to check in. They were offered a $25 dollar credit to use within the hotel. Once my fiancé & I arrived with more family/quests we also had to wait to check in. Since we were excited we didn’t really care we even said we were willing to pay to upgrade since it was our wedding weekend. The only room that was offered to us was the same room we booked with a bigger bathroom. We declined. We didn’t receive anything for our long wait to check in we got a letter on our room door that said sorry... just not very good customer service. We also had two of our guests get locked in their rooms! The locks/ handles were jammed so they had to wait for someone to try to open their doors & let them out. That’s a fire hazard. Also I had hired a makeup artist/ hair stylist from Michigan (where we’re from) to do my services the day of. She had called down to get a stool delivered to her room and they brought up an old folding chair? It’s seems odd you can get a stool at any other hotel but in Vegas where anything goes you can’t. Also be careful with the fridge in your room. It’s filled with liquor and if you even bump into it you will be charged. The sensors go off VERY easily. Yes we had guests who got charges to their rooms for liquor that was not used. Three different guests rooms. We also had another family member walk into their room for the first time after check in and it was messy. The liquor & snacks weren’t in the correct place. They had to call right away to make sure they wouldn’t be charged.    I have stayed/ visited Vegas more than six times and this was my least favorite. Which is sad because we were there for a memorable time. It was also my first time staying at this hotel and my last.
20,They are not accommodating to people with disabilities and did not provide the type of accessible room we reserved. We requested the correct room type and received rude feedback from the staff. The restaurants are good. Terry Fator's show was very very disappointing especially for the price!
40,Currently staying in the mirage hotel for six nights. Having a great time in this great hotel. The only draw back was the check in time. Best part of an hour is crazy. But at least we were expecting that. Recommend trying the app to check in.  Upgraded to the stay well package & cannot find a fault with the room. Spotlessly cleaned every day. A/C perfect as is the bathroom. Excellent view of the strip.  Perfect place to explore the strip.  Paid the extra $35 for an umbrella by the pool. No need for this when you have paid enough already. But in this sun it’s a must.  Seems like standard in many hotels unfortunately.  Excellent staff throughout. Always cheerful & helpful.  Thanks Mirage excellent stay!
50,This was our first stay at the Mirage and it was great. The rooms were clean and we got a free upgrade at checkin because our room wasnt ready. There was plenty of restaurants to eat at with good food. Also plenty of tables and machines to play at. Great Time.
50,Great property wonderful staff clean rooms and casino honestly just about perfect. The location is a 10 and the pool is fantastic. My only complaint is the dealers during the day can seem uninterested at times and also seemed to be abnormally slow. Other than that excellent stay overall.
50,Stayed at the Mirage as we always do when we visit Vegas. The hotel and their service is always top notch. Wonderful variety of restaurants and shops. The pool is great. The Beatles Love Show is excellent. One of the best shows that I have ever attended.
50,Beds are super comfy toilets in the room didnt flush everything was very clean and beautiful the north wing of the hotel does look over Trump tower so we had to keep the curtains closed to not puke. The Rhumbar is fantastic!
50,This was our first visit to Las Vegas and I would definitely consider staying at the Mirage again. Great location on the strip with very friendly and accommodating staff in a beautiful up-scale resort.
50,I was on vacation with my sister who has difficulty walking. Everyone and everything was focused on making her stay the best it could be. From an easy access shower and a room close to the elevator to consideration of where she was seated in the restaurant
20,The rooms are old and dated. Did not feel like this was a 4 star property. The glass in the bar was broken and room service left a lot too be desired. The check in-process was horrendous - the only thing more terrible was the attitude of the staff at mobile checkin
50,We where here for a wedding party great service and food was great as well. Cant go wrong picking the mirage!! We will visit again and stay at the Mirage. Everything you need in Vegas experience and everything a short distance shoppingfood and entertainment.
40,First time in Vegas while the pools were opened. Great pool and ambience if you want a good spot you should get in line when it opens 45- minutes to an hour. Even if you pay for the upgraded adult only pool. Sneak in your own libation no glass $15 and up for a drink can add up in that hot sun.
40,This was our first time staying at the Mirage have only stayed on Planet Hollywood during previous stays. It was a very beautiful hotel with friendly staff and comfy rooms just missed being more central on the strip! Otherwise it was a great getaway in a beautiful hotel.
40,The Mirage has fantastic restaurants great entertainment. 2 of the 4 shows we attended were at the Mirage. All of the staff were very friendly. I am in a wheelchair and they did all they could to accommodate me.
40,We've stayed at The Mirage twice and we love it! The room rates are good and I used my MLife/MyVegas rewards for two free nights (not including the resort fee grrrr). If you're not signed up for MLife I highly suggest doing so and earning rewards on MyVegas.    Our room was on the third floor. The rooms though showing their age a little are clean and comfortable. The toilet seemed extremely low to the ground so that was a bit of a deep squat. Bedside USB ports would be a useful upgrade but they do have ports and plugs at the sitting table. And typical of Vegas resorts there are no coffee makers in the rooms but there is a coffee shop near the guest elevators and a Starbucks with long lines in the casino. The room air conditioning works great!    The Mirage staff has always been friendly and accommodating top notch.    Our main reason for choosing The Mirage is for the awesome pool! It's curvy like a natural lagoon and has waterfalls and the grounds are beautifully maintained blooming and shady and full of birds. There are two secluded whirlpool hot tubs in the pool area plus a separate pool that requires reservations and a topless-optional pool for adults. We've only used the main pool and hot tubs. They have fresh towels you can pick up on the way in.    We love the poolside bar too. I like the slushie drinks with tequila. I got the strawberry with tequila and asked for a Dole Whip swirl and the bartender was kind enough to make it for me but said they can't normally do that. I came back the next day and told the bartender they should definitely offer that as a drink! Everyone who saw it was curious about the drink. I told the bartender call it a Red Tiger (in keeping with The Mirage's theme) make it the Mirage pool's signature drink charge $2 extra if cost is the issue it'll be a hit! But what do I know.    We did mobile check in and check out SO EASY and fast! I highly recommend doing that rather than waiting in line. When you arrive you print your room keys at a kiosk in the main lobby. You'll need to scan your ID card/license.    We enjoy the Secret Garden animals and the frozen yogurt place Blizz which also serves delicious crepes. And of course the iconic Mirage volcano is a fun way to kick
10,I haven’t stayed a mirage (for me seems like forever...being I go to Vegas 2/3x a year) so I thought what the who...Let’s give it another try. My favorite vip host is there and to me it’s a nice crowd of older non partying atmosphere....really laid back not rowdy. My type of crowd. We come to Vegas to gamble eat at fab restaurants and hangout at the pool and once and awhile maybe hit up a dance club...so typical norm of anybody coming to Vegas but you want to throw in there some sleep somewhere in there. It is actually a vacation for some people.    Here’s where my complaint comes in. The 2 nights we were there. All we heard was dog/dogs barking and howling for 3-5 hours in the middle of the night 1am-3/4am!!! Idk if someone left the dog/dogs in the room then took off to enjoy Vegas or they are naturally loud. Then there’s kids/people running up and down the hallway and shouting. The walls and doors are so thin. I understand the excitement but not all of us wants to be woken up out of their sleep. Ohhhhhh and this isn’t the worse of it all!!! The ice machine/ vending area smelled like dog poop!!! The owners of the dog/dogs discarded the dog poop bag in trash! Gross. As soon as you walk pass (not even going in the vending room) you got a huge whiff of it!! Nothing more disgusting than walking smack dab into poopy air. (Sorry don’t know another way to describe it) Sucked for us because that’s the only way to get to our room was to hold our breath till we passed the vending room....needless to say after that we didn’t bother to go into the vending room for ice or vending machine.    I wanted to give mirage another try but this was one of the most UNrelaxing and gross stay I’ve had in Vegas. EVER. Don’t no if this will happen again. Smh.    Mirage could I suggest maybe making a wing of your hotel just pet friendly? I love my four legged friends but some people come to Vegas and to stay at your establishment to actually relax. Not to be woken up by dogs barking and getting off an elevator just to smell dog poop.    #Side notes....ALL of the staff was GREAT!!! Food was awesome and the so was the gambling part.    We get rooms comped all on the strip so giving  Mirage another shot probably won’t happen.
40,Lower ceilings compared to newer properties think it contributes to the very SMOKY casino floor. Rooms are getting tired and old we actaully had a tear in our sofa in our suite. Laundry carts have left long trail lines along the walls in the hallway. Non Smoking Floor 26 and someone in a suite right off the elevator was obviously smoking in their room - why did staff not address?
30,First I have nothing but compliments for the staff. Check-in was excellent and the few other interactions I had with hotel staff were great. My main issue may seem petty but there was no coffee pot in the room. Sure you can go downstairs and wait in line at Starbucks but nobody really wants to see me at that time of morning before at least one cup! Wish I'd checked just assumed there'd be one. I could have brought a French press. Also the WiFi refused to stay connected - the longest was maybe 5 minutes. In 5 days (at a conference held in the hotel) I used it a total of less than an hour and spent the rest of the time eating up my data. The hefty resort fee for WiFi pool and workout room was a total waste as I used none of them. The room was comfortable pillows were awesome. The bathroom needed a little maintenance but not real bad. Next Vegas visit I'll stay elsewhere.
50,Great facility for work and pleasure. Conference catering food was very delicious. I will definitely return when I can enjoy more about the property on personal time. The pool is beautiful and I regretted not having the time to enjoy the amenity.
20,Several things were broke in our room and there was rust all around the drain in the tub. Rooms need to be updated! No supervision of pool lines. Waiter in restaurant was very rude. Check in never called or texted us when the room was ready and we waited 7 hours!
50,Mirage is always top on our list. We love the location and the service there is best in town. 1Oak is the place to be. We visited there twice during our trip and the music and staff was outstanding. The still lounge is a great place as well as there pools. The outside restraint by the pool is a great place to eat with restrooms very close .
50,We stayed at the Mirage for 5 nights as part of a 3 week holiday in America the hotel is lovely. Great staff lovely rooms very comfortable beds great food. I think they have 7 restaurants here. Buffett was about £30 per person but very nice. This hotel has a zoo! They charge around £20 entry but I didn't feel there was enough to see as it took us an hour to see everything including sitting to eat. The pool area was fabulous plenty of loungers available and great bar service should you want to use that. We would definitely recommend staying here and would do again if we had the chance.
50,This Hotel is located righ on the center of the strip! it is very close to the other hotels you don't need a car to move food is great on the buffet also like the service it was very nice all the stuff were very helpul.
40,I have loved the Mirage resort for the last 20 years my recent stay revealed many new fees resort fees parking fees vending machine sodas $4.50. It was all too much for me Love the resort hate the fees.
40,Overall enjoyed my stay and would return. Room was very clean just a little dated for the price. Hotel staff is excellent. Drinks from the pool bar were excellent. Strongest I ordered from anywhere. Casino service could use a lot of work. They were slow and sometimes I never received my drink order at all. Horrible in comparison to other casinos we visited.
30,Mirage charges similar prices to elsewhere on the Strip but does not match the quality or come close.    The rooms are tired and dated. My room was not clean at check in. The check in process took forever.    No outlets to plug in to by the bed (again dated).    No Do Not Disturb signs on the door so maid woke us up early every morning. Nothing we could do.    I recommend you find better.
10,I've been visiting Las Vegas and the Mirage for over 20 years. Every year the resort has become more tired and worn. The room smelled the carpet is worn the headboard on the bed was torn. Check-in took 40 minutes. The casino is not as inviting as many of the other properties on the strip. The pool is still in good shape the the location on the strip is hard to beat. But that is not enough for me to ever stay there again.
40,Very good but disappointed that there was no coffee pot in the rooms otherwise awesome stay. Centrally located on the strip. Excellent staff and service . Would love to come back again .  Did not enjoy paying the resort fee though
40,My husband and I visit Las Vegas once a year and try to stay at a different property each time if we can. This time we decided on the Mirage (Aug. 31st to Sept. 4th) due to the fact that we were travelling with friends and family and wanted to be somewhere a bit more central on the strip. The hotel itself seems to still be well maintained but the rooms were pretty dreadful. I'll reiterate what a few comments have said below the room smelled very damp and mildewy. We thought it was just our room but when visiting our friend's room we discovered that the the smell was strong in their room as well. Aside from that the bathroom was fairly run down some of the caulking needed to be replaced as it looked grimey and moldy.    On our trip we also booked a pool cabana for a group of 6 of us for the day. I will say that this was without a doubt the only reason I will rate the hotel anything above average. The server we had for the day Dana was fantastic never let our drinks get empty and was a wonderful host. The oasis pool was a great get away from the loudness of the main pool.    If you're looking for something central on the strip there are better options.
50,The Mirage is a great hotel. Centrally located on the strip. Great rooms and one of the best pools in Vegas! Stay there you won't regret it! One of the best shows on the strip as well. The Beatles love show!
50,Overall a good stay. The room smelled like mildew and the room was stuffy. Vents may need to be cleaned. Roooms need to be updated. But good attractions at the hotel and great location on the strip...
50,The Mirage is actually pretty small and very easy to navigate. The rooms are big clean and quiet. The pool was beautiful and well used. Restaurants were all excellent and the Cirque du Soleil show was amazing! Overall great experience 😃
50,this was the second time staying at Mirage. The check in staff housekeeping and casino dealers are all very friendly. The Pantry restaurant is a very good place for breakfast. The types of shows at Mirage aren't really the things we like for entertainment. Such as: we aren't Beatles fans not much into Magic or Ventriloquism shows. This isn't a slap in the face to Mirage. it's just not our cup of tee. We highly recomend the Mirage for it's Casino Rooms Staff and location. We will stay there on future trips.
40,Awesome experience overall. Literally only complaint (which is NOT a big deal) was how weak the water pressure was in the shower. I am sure this is common in a big hotel in a big city like this so i understand but Literally everything else was wonderful!
40,This hotel was perfect wanted to stay here for years and heard it does't smell like smoke and it didn't. Room was great but no fridge which we didn't know. We were told it would be $30.00 more a day for the use of a fridge we passed on that. We arrived at 11:15pm on a Wednesday night and waited in line about .25 minutes at check in and arrived in our room a few minutes before midnight. I did ask if we could waive the Resort Fee for that night because it was a few minutes to midnight and they said No. Which as disappointing and made no sense.    Pool was great tons of lounge chairs all around. There are a few bars and a restaurant in the pool area. However with any resort loungers fill up fast and nobody is in them for hours on end. So get down there early to get your chair. Its just a bummer its this way everywhere. We saw chairs not being used for over 3+ hours never saw the people.    Uber / Lyft are at the One Oak Night Club entrance and not at the main entrance which is easy to get to and not a hassle at all. We took several ubers while there and it was very easy. Friday had much more traffic so plan for traffic if you have to be somewhere at a certain time.    The hotel does have mobile checkin/checkout I have heard good and bad about it so i just when to the lobby and checked out at 8am there were 2 people in line and it went fast. You can still stay in your room until 11am check out time not a problem. They are also computer / printers you can use to print your airline boarding passes which I did and it worked perfectly.    I loved this hotel as its the perfect size not to big and easy to find everything. I don't like this big overwhelming hotels where you get lost all the time. They have security at night time by the elevators going up to the rooms you need to show your room card to use the elevator which was a nice touch felt safe at the hotel the entire time. Hotel was very clean and no smell of smoke.
30,Wife and I chose the Mirage again based on location of the strip. Pool was good security was excellent restaurants were very good. Rooms are outdated tho. Our in closet safe did not work which was a bummer
50,The single most impressive feature of a superb hotel is the Stack restaurant. The General Manager has a keen eye for detail and Kristy and Teddy support him well. Food is out of this world and with a great pool great rooms and great shows the Mirage is number 1 for me.
40,"I stayed in a Resort Tower room and had access to a private elevator to get to the 24/25 floors. I was on the 25th floor. It was nice to have views of the mountains and some of the strip. The pool area is like a tropical oasis and the lounge chairs fill up fast. I wish the pool was bigger though because it was always crowded. I liked having breakfast outside every morning at the Pool Cafe while enjoying the sites like the palm trees and waterfall by the pool.    if you eat in the Buffet make sure you mark ""no tip"" when paying. It's all self service even for the bevarages nobody brings you anything!"
40,The Hotel didn't honor my confirmation of room rate the second night of stay. Doubled the price. Very unprofessional. ;I tried to get the hotel to honor the rate when I checked out but they wouldn't. I relize that most hotels in Las Vegas try and get what the market will bare but a confirmation is a confirmation and they should have given me the same rate as I received on Thursday night. This is a good location on the strip and its close to Caesars Hotel and shopping. Food was adequate pricing a bit high but the service was overall good. The rooms are adequate in size shower and tub. Air condition worked well on the hot days I was there. Casino was too smoky for me so I didn't gamble.
50,The Mirage hotel and casino goes above and beyond to ensure a great guest experience. From front desk housekeeping and management everyone went above and beyond to make things right when there was an issue. Security and housekeeping staff always smiled during each encounter and asked if we needed any assistance which I made our stay more pleasurable. There were a few issues at the beginning of our stay but all staff members were very accommodating and resolved issues in a timely manner.
10,This hotel was by far the worst hotel we have stayed at in America.The customer service was horrible.The bell desk will not take your luggage until after 1:30 pm.The room had a old carpet and dust smell that kept me sneezing for four days.Room service comes on plastic plates and boxes.They even charge $50 a day to put you own items in the mini bar.They really need to clean the roomwindowsand most of all the bed was completely worn out and had lumps and holes.Do not stay here if you want to be comfortable.
30,"It's better than the rest but already beat up if these rooms were in face ""recently renovated"". The memory foam bed is hard as a rock. Cleanliness is lacking. Stained chairs & lamp GROSS! Bathroom fan hasn't been cleaned in some time & this is the healthy air room. Looks wonderful when you walk in & ends there. Very irritating that there are NO prices on anything in the essentials shop. Come on MGM you can do better!"
50,We visit Vegas a few times a year for long weekend and mid-week get-aways. We love the Mirage! Upscale and affordable resort located at centre of the Strip absolutely beautiful tropical architecture inside and outside the hotel/casino comfortable accommodations beautiful strip views from the rooms and an amazing huge pool with plenty of daybeds - shade and sun you choose. Another one of the nicest things about the Mirage is their staff. The staff always are smiling polite and go out of their way to be helpful and fulfill a guest's needs.
30,Pros:  First the Mirage is beautiful! Great location on the strip and the pool area is fantastic. For the price the Mirage offers a great value for the location etc. compared to other hotels nearby that are almost double the cost.    Cons:  The guest bathrooms are terrible. I am not quite sure exactly what the issue is; however I have mentioned this is previous reviews over the years and nothing has changed. The exhaust fan is useless. The entire bathroom will be soaked with water by the time you are finished showering (water running down the walls mirror etc.). Also I am not sure if the water pressure is too high or the shower curtain doesn't fit properly BUT the entire floor will be flooded with water after each shower! It doesn't matter how you position the shower head or how you move the curtain the floor will be flooded with water. In addition there is no longer a bath mat so you have to waste one of your 2 towels to mop up the water. It may not sound like a huge deal but when you deal with this every day after each person showers over a 7 day stay-- trust me.... it is a HUGE deal.    Secondly housekeeping has gone from bad to horrible. We only got our room cleaned 2 times over 7 days. The rest we had to physically hunt them down to get towels washcloths etc. One day in particular we left our room at 6:30 a.m. and was gone until 7:30 p.m. and still nothing. We even stopped by the room around Noon to check and housekeeping was right beside our room. We asked the gentlemen if our room was next to be cleaned and he said yes. NOPE!!! 7 1/2 hours later all of housekeeping was gone from our floor and our room was not touched (and no we did NOT have a privacy sign on our door). We had to call housekeeping and ask for towels AGAIN. This is totally unacceptable especially with the daily resort fees you are forced to pay as a guest. We also did not get a restock of shampoo soap etc. so we also had to go to Walgreens to buy our own. They also only want to give you 2 towels and 2 washcloths which doesn't work when one towel has to be used as a mop! I find it hard to believe the Mirage is running low on plain white towels that each guest has to be limited and can't have at least 2 towels and 2 washcloths for each person in the room.    The Mirage needs to drastically improve their housekeeping services as well as correct the bathroom water flooding issues as that really takes away from the joy of staying there. Maybe put in shower stalls? A much larger shower curtain?? Something! Plus hire some people so all the rooms can be cleaned in a timely manner.
40,Roulette has ine of the worst odds of any Casino game. They are so bad a few casinos have gone back to European casino ... that is a single zero. Mirage has gone the other way .. they have added a third zero ... now the odds are really against you! I guess they think all gamblers are really dumb!
50,First visit to Las Vegas and was pleasantly surprised by the Mirage. Strolled through several other hotels while there and by comparison The Mirage best suited us. Classy but not over the top. The fountains are beautiful and the outdoor Rhumbar patio is a great place to sit and have a few drinks and listen to the DJ.
20,Met friends for drinks prior to seeing the show. Our preferred sparkling was out of stock so the bar tender recommended a substitute. Champagne was flat. The bar tender finished a bottle but had to top up from new bottle. Hadn’t realized I had seen her and passed it off as “fit for consumption”. The second problem was that it was sweet whereas our first choice was dry. Unbelievable. When I pointed out both these issues she even tried to defend the undefendable. Even the guy stood next to me said he had seen her use the flat remnants of a bottle!    If we had the time we would have left but we were going to the show. Eventually she offered a replacement. The other bar tender a large build guy acted as if would rather have been anywhere but there I even had to ask if he was serving when he paid no attention to customers waiting.    If it hadn’t been for the location and ambience this would have been a terrible “1”.
40,It was our first time in Vegas. This Hotel is in the Middle of the Strip - central to everything. Be careful with the stocked fridge. We stored a couple of bottles of water in there - only to get a restocking fee on my invoice. I was told that the fridges have sensors so if you store anything in there or take anything out just to take a look at it - you could get billed - new to me. They mentioned there was a notice on the Fridge but we did not see it. Anyway billing issue is resolved but be careful. Overall a pleasant stay.
30,1st time to vacation in Las Vegas. I am from Oklahoma and it was a long trip and expensive to drive. We didnt get to do many things there but it was beautiful at night walking the strip. Would like to come back but it would be several years to revisit.
30,Dined there tonight. Food is ample $37 each and great drink offer $8:50 for unlimited wine and beer. We were pretty angry at waitress though. Seemed to enjoy standing around and chatting rather than clear plates from our table. Twice I took empty plates to them. Second time they told me just leave them they’d collect them. I said no I’d prefer they were cleared prior to dessert. As I walked away my friends over heard them being rude behind my back. Hence no tip left for them! I always leave a tip however If service is poor I don’t see why we should. We are paying top price for food as it is and with low Aus dollar we are paying 35% more also. So I would still say great buffet. Lovely Barman but poor wait service.
10,I’m here for the Maher performance...reserved a Sunday poolside experience...just dropped >$200 on a beautiful dry-aged bone-in strip steak (with an equally beautiful Shafer Cab) at Tom C’s Heritage and I proceed to Reception to check-in to be told that there are no more King rooms available notwithstanding my Res and mobile check-in. I live 365 days a year in hotels and this is my Mirage experience. I am a hospitality consumer at the most consuming level...and my situation is completely unacceptable. Most egregious: Reception person says Did you read the fine print? Mirage MGM: Really? This is your notion of hospitality? So as a consumer I will enjoy Maher but take my gambling sports book for early NFL games dining elsewhere. I reserved with you but you don’t respond in kind. I envy you that you can do this without a hint of respect. Fair play to you.
40,This hotel has a great location right in the action on the strip. The hotel rooms are nice and the pool area is awesome. The only negative is that the restaurants aren't as good as at other MGM group resorts.
40,Great hotel and great location. I stay here every time in Vegas now due to solid service location convenience of hotel and layout. Food is excellent and all places. Great poker room and pools. Drinks can get pricey but that’s Vegas for ya. Highly refommend.
40,The hotel is very nice. We found the rooms to be comfortable and clean. Pool is great. Location is perfect. We really enjoyed our day at Bare. Biggest problem is lots of families and kids the clientele is very middle class not fancy. We wanted an adult get away the atmosphere was too informal and the pool too full of kids.
40,Horrible experience at check. Waited 2 hours. Mirage should at least offer some refreshments like water beer or small snacks. Show price advertisment was misleading your in hotel sign shows ticket price starting $55 but in fact starting price was $107.
20,The people on the staff were a clear five. However the rest of the place is designed to separate you from your money in every way possible not just the casinos where you expect it. For example no cheap buffets.Over forty bucks a head on a weeknight.The prime rib was not quality meat it was almost like chewing on a cubed steak. The ribs were burned to the bone and inedible. Everything looked like it had been out a while.The breakfast buffet was better but still overpriced. Everything in the shops was jacked up. No drinking fountains to be found but you had to pay $4.75 for a 99 cent bottle of water. No coffee pot in the room but $4.50 for a very average cup of joe. The rewards card was a joke. At 1 point for $10.00 spent in the casino there were no comps until you had 1000 points to get $10.00 in free play. That is $10000.00 to get $10.00 more to loose in the incredibly tight slots. And fifteen bucks a day for parking. This part of the experience was a clear zero. Worst Vegas experience ever.
50,Always a great time at the Mirage. This is our 5th year having a friends get together at the Mirage. Enjoyed the Oasis pool the Dolphin experience. The staff check in process overall experience is first class. Pantry is excellent as well.
40,Rooms were spacious and easy to access. The dealers for the table games were fun and made the gaming experience much better than other resorts. If your looking for Military discount ensure you call ahead to ensure you get otherwise they will not honor it!
10,2 1/2 checkin time after getting turned away the first time. Also provided wrong room and TV didnt work. Was given a 2nd room and it smelled like mildew. Front desk didnt seem to care about the issue. I was told to wait until the next day to resolve it. Also had a giant odor machine to fix it. A whole day was wasted dealing with a room and satisfaction. This was supposed to be a time to relax from stress not add stress.
50,Fantastic pool. Very relaxing stay. Service was excellent entire stay. Wide verity of amenities and restaurants on site. Excellent location in the middle of the strip easy to get anywhere. Loved the volcano show
30,Nice and clean with comfortable bed but room was too hot even with AC at lowest setting. Disliked the fact that the pool closes at 7. Night swimming was something we was looking forward too. Bathroom set up was far from ideal and no fridge to keep our drinks or left over food in. Will prob stay somewhere else next time.
40,The room was clean and had a great view. We stayed on New Year's Eve and watched the fireworks from the window. Plenty of things to do at the hotel and within walking distance of shops and entertainment. I will be staying again!
50,Spotless hotel  staff super friendly and nothing too much trouble fantastic location check in and out good no complaints and would have no hesitation in staying here again.  don’t miss the Beatles cirque great show
50,This hotel is nice...you want a casino that doesn't smell like smoke this is perfect. The entrance is perfect to go out on the strip. Big swimming pool.Rooms are big and nice and clean. We where in 3 in the room called and they brought the things for 3 in 5 min. The great thing is they worry about there guests after a certain hour they have security going to the rooms.would go back
10,Poor Customer Service room was very hot called housekeeping for a fan and was told no fans. I expressed my experience with manager and she told me I should have called engineering. This was my first and last time I will stay at this hotel.. swimming pool was over crowded.
30,Made a reservation for 2 resort king rooms 3 nights each 3 months in advance. Upon check-in was informed that they did not have any king rooms available and were forced to settle for double queens. Essentially making reservations at this hotel is a big waste of time.
50,The Mirage Hotel & Casino    I enjoyed my stay at the Mirage Hotel and Casino. The restaurants are all very good. The staff at the Hotel are very nice and attentive to your needs. The room are very nice and clean.
40,very nice hotel location great pool wonderful rooms a little dated good value the casino is your basic las vgas casino. Room service has a limited menue compared to other las vegas hotels. Drinks are very expensive poolside
50,I would recommend the Mirage to anyone. It is easy to get around. Not a huge hotel which we love. The staff is so friendly and accommodating. The location is ideal and the pool is wonderful. We have stayed here 3 times and I wouldn’t stay anywhere else.
40,VIP staff was courteous and friendly. Make sure you get the macaroons during check in. Minor problem with the room which was fixed immediately. Restaurants were superb. Otoro was our favorite.    Definitely will be back.
50,The Pantry restaurant serves an excellent breakfast and lunch. Good value for the moderate prices. You get great tasting food and plenty of it. Large casino with plenty of places to gamble. Plenty of signs to guide you through the property. Nice pool area.
50,I have been to Las Vegas many times over the years. I have stayed at most of the hotels on the strip. This was my first stay at the Mirage and I choose the Stay Well rooms. They are awesome. The smart lighting was a great option. The bed was plush and gave a great nights sleep. The rooms and halls are HEPA filters and you can really tell the difference. Especially when coming back from the casino smoke. The restaurants selection was good. I would stay here again when in Las Vegas.
20,Room smelled like mildew. No microwave or coffee maker in the room. You’ll pay $10 for a coffee if you want it. The fridge is completely filled with items for sale but there is no price list or room to put any of your own food in it. The food and drinks are extremely expensive. There’s no shuttle to/from the airport. The slot machines don’t pay out. And there’s kids running around everywhere at all times. Military personnel should consider staying at Nellis AFB. It’s worth the cost of a rental car.
50,The Mirage was a beautiful property well mainataned and very clean!! We would absolutely select the Mirage for our future trips to Las Vegas. Terry Fator was a blast and did not disappoint. You cannot go wrong at the Mirage!!
50,My wife and I have stayed at the Mirage for the past several years All Staff regardless of job title or function are extremely professional and welcoming - Keep it up!!!!!  You can not go wrong staying at the Mirage
50,10 of us stayed at the Mirage to celebrate my Daughters 21st Birthday. Everyone had a Great time!!! We ate at the PantryStacksand Cravings every meal was great.Can't wait to go back... Thanks for a wonderful time Mirage!!
50,Wanted to take a trip to celebrate my husband and my own 50th birthday. Loved every minute of it! The pool food rooms casino and staff were all amazing. Everything was wonderful. We will definitely be back again.
30,Everything was just ok for us. We usually really enjoy our time here and thus time around it was just ok we just expected More. Buffet was average room average casino average. It's not a bad hotel just didn't wow us this time around
50,Overall Experience was great. Housekeeping staff was very friendly. The person checking me in was efficient and professional. Casino host Chase is the best. She is very attentive to her guests. I will definitely return in the future.
20,Rooms are outdated.Water was coming out of light fixture in shower at 330am.Management made us switch rooms.It took until 4pm to get a different room.Management was supposed to text me when room was available no text ever received instead me and my wife just went to front desk to be told that they were going to contact us when ready.This quagmire basically cost is one of our 2 days  I do understand that it was a holiday weekend and it was extremely busy as i was told repeatedly by management but it didn't make us feel better.We were given 50 dollars in food and beverage comps but truely i just wanted another room.Brunch had old crab legs and some food that looked like it was recycled.Basically it wasn't fun for us with the smell of vomit as you walk out of elevators and parking garage had remnants of vomit that dried in the dessert heat.We frequent mgm properties and this by far was our worst!
30,Typical expectations met. Nothing beyond sub par. However the smoke was over whelming and cause us to get very sick with sinus infection. No fridge in room. Fridge was stocked with stuff to purchased. Ice machines sparse so had to drink warm water.
10,Very poor customer service. I paid for early check in and it was guaranteed by 11am and they sent me to the 23rd floor with my luggage and said they would text me by 11 with the room number an hour passed no text and I had an extremely long hold time trying to reach someone at the front desk. I would of just walked back down there but it was extremely far to haul of our luggage back downstairs just to have to haul it back upstairs without any assistance. My mom had an important event and had to leave there to find another accommodation to get ready at as we just flew in that is why we needed the early check in by 11. I was offered a refund for the fee I paid and said I would have it credited at check out the day of check out their computer system was down so they said they would email me with the bill adjustment. They emailed my alright but there was no bill adjustment. I also had an issue with the room and they had me move to another room and was told they would waive the resort fees that you have to pay there but they did not follow through on that either. The establishment was nice but the customer service was not.
50,Huge resort but you don't feel lost at all; very intimate; suites are great; feel very safe with security; restaurants were great. Lots of slots we had not seen before; sprawling casino with lots of choices.
50,"Just returned from staying at the Mirage for Labour Day long weekend. My husband and I had the best stay there. As soon as we arrived it felt like we were in Hawaii a tropical oasis. Really loved all the greenery waterfalls and everything smelled fresh.    Check-in line was long but moved along quickly. The receptionist we had was so inviting and since we checked in late the room we originally reserved was no longer available. We still got into a really nice room and in exchange for the ""inconvenience"" they gave us a F&B credit for the hotel.    Next day we were moved to a new room with nice views of the strip. The F&B credit was so ideal as it allowed us to try the Italian restaurant at the Mirage. AMAZING food and service! Best calamari we ever had.    The pool and lounge area was awesome with plenty of areas to sit.    The bed & pillows really were perfect I wish I could take them home with us!    Have been to Vegas 6 times and this was by far our favorite as we always like to stay at different places each time.    Thank you to everyone at the Mirage for amazing hospitality! :)"
50,Just came back from a 4 day 3 night long weekend in Las Vegas. Stayed at the Mirage and they came through with flying colours. Received great service starting with our check in (minor lineup) was on the 23rd floor overlooking the pool awesome service & food at LV Burger exceptional service from the Box Office. I had accidentally purchased too many tickets to Shim Lin & the box office helped me out with my situation.
50,I love this hotel! HANDS DOWN THE BEST!! My favorite out of all the hotels I've stayed at.. Alot of options for food& GOOD food! The pool is magical and the atmosphere is just dreamy! Cant wait to go BACK!!! I'm a Mirage lifer lol
10,Systems were down it was a 3 hour check in. They put us in the wrong room.We booked a king got two double beds. After another hour finally got to our room where it reaked of mold or mildew. Front office offered to waive the resort fee I just want to ne able to breath. Honestly this place is a mess I would advise you to stay somewhere else  that pains me to .say that
40,We spent the last 4 nights of a two week vacation at the Mirage. The hotel suites were spacious and very clean. The rooms were cleaned promply every day and there are many ammenities at the hotel. We were on the top floor (E) and had a great view of the las vegas strip at night.
50,I go to Vegas to unwind and relax. I always stay at the Mirage because their staff is professional and courteous across all areas of the hotel/casino/spa. The rooms are clean and comfortable.    I have eaten at many of the restaurants as well as the buffet and have been quite satisfied with the taste portion price point and service with in the eating establishments. The fitness room is small but well equipped.    The spa is very relaxing with the amenities one would expect in a spa. I did get a massage this trip and was very grateful that the masseuse listened to what I asked for and delivered a very deft tendon releasing massage.    I did not go into the pool this time however; I have enjoyed it when the weather was not quite so hot. The pool is clean and appropriately staffed. The pool deck and chairs are clean.    Then there is the casino...I am loyal to a casino of the hotel I stay at so long as I am doing well- which for means not losing my daily limit in an hour- which held true this visit as well. There is a good filtration system. In other words unlike some other casinos I don't smell like an ashtray when I retire to my room. The dealers are friendly talkative if you want to talk and quiet if you are....in other words they know how to read room. One night after I had been uo and playing for a very long time very long time; I made 2 mistakes 2 hands in a row. I was playing pai gow so I was really only hurting myself. In essence the dealer sent me to bed....and I am grateful. He could have let me continue loosing to the house.    I recommend the Mirage for the above reasons...it is also well placed and priced.
50,When we come to Vegas we always stay at The Mirage our 'home away from home' -- Everything we need in a great location on the Vegas strip delicious restaurants spacious sportsbook and iconic pool!
50,The Mirage is absolutely a great hotel and casino in Las Vegas. Friendly staff excellent rooms. great eating selections and amazing casino.The hotel has a great location on the Strip The Mlife awards program offers great benefits including comp rooms. .
50,I stay at this hotel every single time I stay in Vegas. I love the setup the smell of the casino the up keep. The stores and my favorite is the pool. Best pool in Vegas in my opinion. The renovations in the bedrooms mostly in the bathrooms was a nice surprise. Can't wait to go back!
50,Hotel was very nice and clean and beds were so comfortable. Food was delicious and Air Conditioner was on point...Beautiful Hotel. I will be definitely be coming back for my Birthday in January. Thanks!
10,I got a room with view to Strip on level 22. Airconditioner blows very smelly air. It was impossible to sleep. First night is destroyed. Second day I told it to the cleaner and in 2 minutes I got a big noisy aircleaner. (2 minutes means that its not a rear request from the guests) It blows perfumed air the result was even worst after 2 hours “aircleaning”. Then I got a new room at the reception at level 12 a staywell room. It has better air but parfumed or some kind of hard menthol was in the air. (The motor of air conditioner creaked noisly) Anyway all places in this hotel has a strong cigarette smog (from the funtiture and from the carpet) mixed with overdosed parfume. It destroyed our holiday.
10,"Terrible service at the Front Desk very rude and arrogant. David at Front Desk refused me service 3 times to my face. The Manager actually told me that my experince is ""unimportant"". Single female travelers be prepared to be looked down on and dismissed - you are not important to them just ask the Front Desk Manager."
40,this was a very nice hotel that i stayed at. i would love to come back here and stay at the mirage next time. service was good the pool was amazing the hotel itself was really good. i cant wait for my next trip back at the mirage
50,This was my second time staying at the Mirage. Great location on the strip. Love the ambiance of the place. Enjoyed more activities and restaurants on site at the Mirage this time. Tried Carnegie Deli which was a great option for breakfast (try the corned beef hash) as well as Otoro (sushi) for dinner. Also liked the coffee place and smoothie/crepe place by the pool entrance. Our room was near the elevator so a bit noisy but that is what you expect for LDW. All staff we encountered were friendly and helpful from the housekeepers to check in. Highly recommend mobile check in and check out (no waiting even on a holiday weekend). The pool was the best part definitely get there right at 8:30am for a spot. Checked out the adult pool very nice but pretty small so I would recommend just the regular pool. The Beatles show is a must (have seen 3 times now). My husband's favorite part was the Sigfried and Roy Secret Garden with big cats and dolphins. There is a new baby dolphin that is adorable. Definitely worth the price for entrance. Will definitely be back to the Mirage!
50,Excellent location. Excellent value. Love the pool the food availability at the resort and the surrounding area. The entertainment is amazing. The Mirage is the best value with the best options on the strip.
30,"The 5th trip this year and the only solo trip to Vegas (Usually travel only with friends or family). Prior to this trip I had 3 or 4 days comped room offer at the Wynn or MGM properties. I chose Mirage to work on my progress to Platinum (I had gold status and 119K tier credits) with MLife. Mirage happened to be the place I played my first ever hand of blackjack at in 1991.    With the additional days and resort fees the total after comps was 376.00 for 8 days. Spirit airlines with big front seat and checked bags roughly 300.00. I booked a full size car with National with my executive status with them was hoping to get a cool ride but looks like LV National sucks as all they had was Full Size Cars o_O (second time this year so looks like a regular pattern) anyways 237.00 for the 8 day rental. All in roughly about 1000.00 for the trip. My goal was to get the Platinum status this trip and make the trip ""free"" if possible.    I planned to work from my room weekdays 9 to 5 and play after work or weekends as time permits this was purely a gambling trip as I was a little too maxed out on shows this year.    My check-in was around midnight saw a few hookers at the lobby bar checking me out as I walked past them to the guest elevators. I had 5K bankroll for this trip. Over the course of Friday Night to Sunday Night I had blown 3K as I was reckless but had built a good rapport with the Pit Crew and earned the distinction of being a generous tipper.    As I was walking back to my room I saw the pit boss from the previous night. I was telling her that I was down to my last 2K and might have to stay in my room for the next 5 to 6 days if I blew my bankroll. She pointed me to a table and said the table has been paying out all day she said sit right there and don't leave. It was pure magic. Started with 2 hands of $100 in 15 minutes or so I had my bankroll back in my pocket.    Weekend spent well gambled for like 18 hours - Highlight being that I was even after all the fun had a good dinner at the heritage steakhouse (The crab cakes are the best I have ever tasted I had to get myself a 2nd) also their sides of Mushrooms was phenomenal) as were the scallops 200$ Dinner with tips just by myself :D (My waiter was Anthony) who knew this will be one of many expensive dinners to come this trip. I had dinner at the Heritage steakhouse on 2 more nights.    I had also found a legit massage place at 5300 W Sahara 90 minutes massage was 60$ worked out all the soreness from sitting too long at the tables. Had 3 - 90 Minute massages this trip was blissful and relaxing.    Monday through Thursday I was little bit more cautious and making 300 to 1000 every time I sat down to play blackjack at the Mirage. One of those days met a couple of local guys they invited me to go casino hoping. Bad timing on my part crossed over to Harrah's and lost 1200$ playing Double Deck BJ before I knew my new friends were gone too but with a win. I was down 1K after the trip to Harrah's (But that started the offers from Caesar's for 4 night comped rooms at their properties).    I had enjoyed the pool and long island teas from the attentive waitresses taken the day pass to the spa and felt refreshed.    Thursday night rolled in I had tipped over 2100$ to dealers 250$ to cocktail waitresses 35$ For Valet 30$ for housekeeping until then I had 1200$ more than I had brought after all the expenses (that I paid with cash):D:D:D. Most pit bosses / dealers knew me by this time one of my sitting with a dealer the dealer said we made more than you to which the pit boss said Mr. XXX is always like that - I was more than I could have asked for on this trip. Overall the dealers waitresses were enjoying the generosity.    But as luck would have it had 5 hours before bedtime on Thursday night so had to sit down at the 25$ tables before retiring. The crew at the pit was not familiar at all took out chips for 2200K in 3 installments and was down to my last 500K when I decide to press before I knew I set aside 3K in chips and was playing with my leftovers tipped the dealers 300$ over the course of that run. When I dipped into my 3K pile one hand for 125$ I decided to cash in. I started a separate thread on that as the first pass the dealer tried to pay me 1575$ instead of 2875$ (I was caught off guard as I was not watching what he was doing) I was taken aback one mistake I notice was he had taken a purple chip from my pile and was trying to pay me with that (All the players at the table vouched for the fact that it was my purple chip). After wasting another 20 minutes or so I was paid 2375$ (short changed by 500$). I decided I was not going to give anymore of my Money to Mirage that trip. I stuck to my decision until checkout on Saturday just used the resort credit for the rest of the expenses    Summary of the trip:    Goods:    MLife says I made 6K (But I took home 1200$ more than I brought for the trip mission accomplished it was a free trip)    Earned 63K in tier credits (18K short of Platinum).    Met a lot of people and had fun at the tables.    I now have comped rooms at Caesar's properties.    Overall good fun with nice dinners massages gambling pool spa.    Bads:    Mirage should not have short changed me left a bad taste in my mouth.    Need another trip to get my Platinum status"
30,I expected a lot more from this hotel. Rooms are okay pool is filled with kids and have to pay to go to adults pool. My hallway had a hole in the wall and was being held together by electrical tape.
50,Everything was excellent at the Mirage except our room was a little dated and small compared to the rooms at Treasure Island which appears be a twin of the Mirage. We had the double queen room but I didn't see the other room offerings at the Mirage so we may have opted for a smaller room without realizing. Otherwise the casino itself pool restaurants and shops were all excellent. Visible and friendly staff and security throughout the resort. The Mirage is in a great location right in the center of the strip so walking to any of the other casino's was great. I would recommend the Mirage to anyone heading to Las Vegas. Although I don't drink I am still a smoker and I appreciate that I can still smoke in the casino and not be treated like a second class citizen as I am throughout the rest of country. That is one of the main reasons I enjoy going to Las Vegas!
40,As soon as we arrived at the Mirage we were helped by some extremely friendly employees while checking in. Our rooms were always cleaned and if we needed something extra the housekeeping department was very prompt and friendly also.
50,My family and myself stayed at the Mirage over the Labor Day weekend and they absolutely loved their experience here. This wasn't my 1st time staying here however it was everyone else's 1st time. The customer  service was impeccable!
40,I come to Vegas often and I think I might have very high expectations now. I was disappointed that the mobile check in machines actually close. You would think they would be working all night. There is definitely room for improvement on check in technology. The mobile app is about useless. On to the review of the hotel. It is starting to show its age. On my floor a water pipe broke and I got to listen to carpet drying fans for 2 days. This could be a fluke I guess. The rooms are nice. Again seem to be a bit dated but clean. It is located center strip right where you want to be.
50,My kids love the volcano show. We come here every year to watch. It is like a family things now. Location is great but I think Mirage might want to think make over the room a little. The carpet in the room is pretty old. Also they might needs a little more staff during holiday to take care the rush of customer
50,A Wonderful time at The Mirage & Amazing Mind Blowing Experience at The Beatles LOVE Cirque Du Soleil !!! Plan on doing the same Vacation in Spring of 2020 !! Will fine at the same delicious restaurants at The Mirage
50,Stayed here for our anniversary. Wonderful staff accommodations and restaurants.    There's so much to do here you don't even have to leave to enjoy a top notch Vegas experience. I would definitely recommend this hotel and casino.
40,Spent several days on vacation. The room was very nice and the pool was beautiful. It was very hot so I went early. Lots of free loungers. Just be aware the pool is not for swimming only relaxing I. 3.5 feet of water
40,The Mirage is a great hotel with a beautiful pool ( which we enjoyed on some of the record breaking days of August) The front desk was very friendly and the check out was a breeze. We would certainly stay here again.
10,never going back to this casino at all I made my reservation for two rooms a week before when we arriving at the hotel when we checked in at 2:40 p.m. They told us that check in was at 3:00 p.m. and that they still didn't have the rooms ready. i have to give out my phone number and they would send me a text letting me know when the room is ready the text arrived until 4:30 pm we lost a lot of time carrying our bags in the hands all the people we were watching was a total shame the person who attended us at the front desk did not apologize for giving us the room so late and never seemed to smile so much hotel luxury is of no use but we also had help from the maid to be given us sooner the room that we already booked and he did his job very nicely the name is carlos sadly i do not remember his last name
10,Visited and ate here on 8/30. Price was nearly 90.00 for 2. Hostess said they increased the price due to Labor Day weekend. If you’ve eaten here in the distant past you won’t recognize the place. It has steadily went waaay downhill. Probably explains why so few were eating there. Very very disappointing. We enjoyed buffets at Wynn’s Bellagio and Caesar’s while on this trip and the prices are comparable to what the Mirage was charging but the quality of both the experience and the food at the other properties was not even close. I do not recommend eating here. In hindsight we wished we had used the comp $$ to eat at one of the restaurants instead.
50,Clean resort friendly staff. Enjoyable stay overall. We stayed here for the first time for our anniversary last month and The Mirage did not disappoint! Good restaurants nice pool great location in town.
40,The Oasis Pool was a perfect spot to cool down for Vegas. The staff and food were great. The Mirage itself is good but can be a bit Smokey. We also went to the Beatles Show which was excellent. I would recommend the Mirage.
20,This was my first time staying at the Mirage but I will never stay again. We arrived at the hotel around 5pm. I had checked in online earlier in the day so we used the automatic booths to get our room keys and assignments. When we entered the room I noticed right away that the carpet didn't look as spotless as one would expect from an MGM hotel but I shrugged it off and unpacked anyways. After finishing unpacking I noticed a CHEETO on the floor. Upon closer inspection I also discovered an empty water bottle under a table. Since it was early in the evening we stopped at the front desk to request someone vacuum while we went for dinner and a walk on the strip. We returned at midnight to find that they had not sent anyone. We then discovered that the toilet did not work. We called down to the desk and they reprogramed our keys for a new room. So at midnight (after being up at 5am for an early flight) we packed up and moved to the new room. We thought our problems were solved but the next night we got back to our room at 2am. Our keys didn't work... We used the telephone down the hall to call the front desk and they had to send security up to let us in. After that they did give us a few nights credits for the resort fees but it was disappointing to have that many issues in our first few nights. Staff were friendly and understanding - but cleanliness is at the top of my list for a hotel. Will not be staying here again.
20,Extremely slow response to remedy broken air conditioning in room. Contacted front desk 6 times in order to keep progress moving. We were finally offered a room change after 24 hrs of unbearable room temp.In the end a manager offered to waive the resort fee but the fee was charged anyway. So disappointing.
40,Great hotel! Always my choice stay visiting Vegas staff is very friendly! Food is amazing with great choices. Plenty for slots and gaming tables. Pool are clean and fully staffed! Rooms clean and housekeeping accommodates your schedule.
30,room was fairly clean with great cleaning staff. Our room was close to the elevator so it was kind of noises at night with the young people. The restaurants and the buffet at the hotel was below par but the location of the hotel is excellent. Its right in the middle of everything.
30,The rooms are not the cleanest but then again it could have been our room that was not cleaned properly on a subjective level. Staff friendliness is applicable throughout hotel come are nice and accommodating and others are not. Overall if you want to have a great experience and are willing to pay for it choose another hotel.
50,This is my preferred hotel of the MGM properties in Las Vegas. We stayed 4 nights (thurs-mon). Check-in staff was friendly and very quick to get us on our way. Room was on a higher floor with a great view of the volcano and strip. We had plenty of room. The bathroom could use a remodel it needed a refresher. Housekeeping was amazing as always (make sure you always tip housekeeping!). Pool was nice and refreshing since it was over 100 degrees out the pool service staff was quick to refill our drinks. Just a great stay will be back again!
50,great location great decorthe service was up and above at some of the strip hotelsthe staff was very friendly and helpful. the hotel has enough attactions on its own so you really don't have to go any where else
30,I always thought the Mirage was a luxury hotel so was looking forward to staying there when a friend announced he was having his birthday weekend at the property.    Upon arrival we were told that the king room we had reserved was not available and the only upgrades would be queen bedded rooms (the rate we were offered for the upgrade was 33% higher for the same room versus the online upgrade rate btw so make sure you upgrade online if you are interested in that). The only king available that night was the handicap room but we were told we could move into another room the next night.    The handicap room looked like it was one of the older rooms. The only real area of concern was the bathroom because the hot water in both the sink and shower were dangerously hot. In the shower especially the water would be cold for a long time and then suddenly become scaldingly hot until you turned the handle to almost the off position. For anyone who has small children or who is caring doe someone with special needs I would pay close attention to the shower temperature.    The hotel staff was very good about changing our room the next day. We called in the morning as instructed and they called us back when the new room was ready. They were able to change our key cards remotely so we did not have to go back to reception.    The new room was on the 10th floor and was clearly a renovated room. The mattress was much better and the room looked good. The shower in this room had the same temperature issue (looked like the only thing not updated in the rooms was the bathtubs and plumbing) but the room itself was very nice.    The casino was nice. It was not super smoky and I am impressed with the ventilation system. The casino was always busy but not uncomfortably so. There was a nice mix of tables and slots.    I liked the pool area a lot. We didn't go into the topless area (I couldn't quite figure out where it was) but the cabana area was super! We had the same waitress the whole time we were there and she was a doll.    I wish there were a few more dining and shopping options. The buffet restaurant was not very impressive and there were few options for an inexpensive bite. LVB was great and my husband really enjoyed the breakfast at Pantry. Pantry really was the only mid-priced option and the line was often a 45+ minute wait during peak hours.    Overall the Mirage was not what I had expected and I was a little disappointed.
50,First time staying here ( third time to Vegas in 20 years ) and wanted a location that was in the middle of the Strip.  Staying from Wednesday to Wednesday so got a very affordable rate and was not disappointed with the large king room overlooking the Strip and nightly Volcano Show.  Taxi ride from airport cost between $13 and $20 depending on traffic ( we paid $15 including tip )  Check in on Wednesday afternoon was ok. They should have more staff and check in stations as the Friday night line was very long.  Staff were very friendly and lots of smiles!  I’m not sure when the upgrades were done but the entire resort including the rooms seem new and show no sign of age.  Pool is beautiful and crowded on weekend but we always seemed to get good chairs no matter what time we went as people come and go. ( We thought about showing up at the 8am opening of the pool to reserve chairs on Sunday morning but there was a lineup over 70 feet long....Really! ) Showed up at 1pm and a couple was leaving poolside..... our luck at the pool is better than in the casino!  Resort wants to sell you upscale pool chairs with umbrellas at $50 per person but you can find shade for free!  Good choice of restaurants ( Carnegie Deli has great breakfast for under $20 pp )  Couldn’t justify paying $35 pp plus for buffet.  Next door at Ceaser’s Palace is The Cheesecake Factory which has a great affordable menu.  Across the street is Denny’s and numerous other fast food restaurants.  There is also a Walgreens across the street which is a great place to buy water and snacks.  Definitely coming back to the Mirage.
50,Everytime I book the mirage it is a awesome stay friendly staff excellent location on the strip. The dolphin and tiger exhibit is awesome the newest baby dolphin is a must see. The heritage steak house is the best on the strip. Friendly staff.
30,This hotel is okay nothing spectacular. The maid service left a lot to be desired—dirty towels not consistent. The restaurant service was terrible food is okay.  The best part about this hotel is the adult pool and cabana rental. This area was perfect and the service was outstanding!
20,First timemirage 56 dad party of six been coming to vegas every year for the last15 years. complained for the first time dirty towels room very tired ask id for bare pool $ 30 entrance fee really little hitler start lectures me about not carrying id when staying casino. Had room card cc card on me can keep the bare pool sons already in there waste of money no beds in main pool so going to bare pool. Buffet 20 dollars for breakfast 34 dollars on week-end with out tax not worth it. Sorry will not be staying here again back to the paris again in October. Received complimentary voucher for $50 for state of room and towels but still feel let down more like a two star hotel with five star prices.
10,Suite had broken items moved to new suite which also had several broken items and room very outdated. Broken shower drain refrigerator tv on the wall stand cabinet drawer. Room had a stale smell to it. Carpet heavy stained
40,"This was my first stay at Mirage and I'll definitely be back. The pool complex is fantastic with a nice variety of seating and areas. (The Bare ""toptional"" pool area isn't really my cup of tea just because it's a younger crowd.) The room service situation is more like ordering UberEats or DoorDash than a traditional hotel room service but the food was good. I like the slot variety -- although of course they can always be a little looser right?? Found it difficult to get a cocktail waitress to come around during weekday gaming; hopefully that was a one-off issue."
50,Loved my stay at The Mirage and would love to go back! The staff was great and helpful. Loved the food and the shows. The location was perfect. The Mirage also has the best pool! Security key checks in the evening made me feel safe. When I go back to Vegas I would love to stay at The Mirage again!
10,The room we were given had stains on the carpet bed sheets and pillows. The TV did not work the wifi did not reach the room and toilet did not flush correctly. We requested a room change and after 5 hours of waiting for another room they informed us that there were no more room with a view of the strip and the only room available had a view of the pool. We were then told we could stay in the room we currentlyhad or change to a room that no longer had a view of the strip.
20,The Mirage is not what it once was. Prepare to be disappointed. To call this a B- property is generous. It used to be the premiere property in Las Vegas. They need to improve the service and the maintenance.
50,This hotel is great. We stayed for a week. The location is right in the center of the strip. The adult only pool was lots of fun. The room was clean. We stayed in a room with a view of the strip which also has a view of the pools and dolphins. We highly recommend this hotel.
30,Just ehh. Rooms were ok restaurants were ok casino was ok. Best part is the location which was worth the stay. Hallways to your room tripped me out. Nothing spectacular and nothing to complain about.
40,The mirage is a great hotel. The staff is very accommodating and friendly.  The pool and amenities area is wonderful. Food options are great and the rooms are nice.  The only negative about the hotel is that most of the attractions to the strip are south which means you will be walking a lot.
20,Room was not clean prior guests dirty socks left under chaur room smelled areas of rug damp pool area under waterfalls moldy cigarette butts under falls landing used drink cups everywgere tge first nigbt like tbere wasnt a staff to clean
50,Love this hotel  The pool is lovely the staff was very nice and attentive and the drinks by the pool were delicious! The rooms were very clean and the whole place always smelled pretty good  And they have cute dolphins
50,Highly recommend! Friends and I went here to celebrate a birthday and we were satisfied with the care and friendliness the staff had. Very professional but still very entertaining. The casino is fantastic.
50,Beds were comfortable room was very quiet. Hotel in great location on the strip. Checkin could have been faster only 3 windows open for large line. Overvall very satified for our first stay at the Mirage and it wont be our last!
50,I travel to Vegas almost once a month and there is something I appreciate a good night sleep and I had that at the Mirage. Greatly thankful for the opportunity to stay at your property more than satisfied and invited to stay again.
10,Including tax the resort fees are $43 per day. Self parking is $15 per day. Valet parking is $24.00 per day. Not enough restaurant choices and the ones they had were too expensive. The bed was hard and they did not clean the room until after 1pm
30,The illusion of Vegas as a fancy place has faded. I guess it depends where you stay but the Mirage is a vision of the “below average joe”.  The crowd is pretty disgusting-heavy slovenly dressed meandering along.  We had to wait 45 minutes in the check in line. Unacceptable.  Our room had beat up furniture and the leather headboard was actually torn that my husband called down to have it replaced. The toilet had trouble flushing. The shower head was sticking way out of the wall. Pretty gross.  The wait for hotel restaurants was long and the quality of food average.  The pool was so crowded you could barely walk through it let alone find a chair.  I also went up to BARE - gross! It was so small and packed you could barely see the water. No seats available. People making out in the pool some topless women.  On top of all this waiting poor quality and averageness is that it’s expensive!  I think I’m done with Vegas.
50,Excellent Strip location. Reasonable rates. Best show on the Strip — Love! Highly recommend. Request a volcano view! Spring is a nice time to see the dolphin habitat and all the newborn animals. Our home away from home.
50,Mirage always has great entertainment and is in a perfect location on the strip. Makes for an easy walk to other Vegas venues. It would have been a better trip if I had won money. The pool area was good because it has a section which provides shade and a waterfall.
40,I have stayed her several times before and this place is always a pleasure. It isn't the biggest or the fanciest but the staff has been great every time. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are nice. They have great on site entertainment - Beatles Love is awesome and Terry Fator is fun. The buffet is excellent. Carnegie Deli has some of the best corned beef on the planet. The pool is wonderful. And the Secret Garden is a nice break from the hustle and bustle of Vegas. The location is excellent.
50,Great location and cleanliness. Service is friendly with a smile. First time stay but will stay again. Restaurants are great with a lot of options. Pool was a great place to cool off and very clean. Can’t wait to make it back.
30,Good location but your basic rooms lack a fridge and coffee maker. Prices at the gift shop and buffet are on the high side. Not worth playing at the lower limit blackjack tables with the 6 to 5 odds. Overall friendly staff.
10,"A very ""nickle and dime"" kinda place. Even if you think you're paying your room upfront ahead of time they slap on an additional ""resort fee"" for 50USD. Charged me 15USD and 18USD for items taken from bar even though we only took one item. Rooms were average clean enough but not even super nice. Pool was great to be fair."
40,A great place except Guests having to pay for parking is absurd ! The staff is friendly and helpful. The grounds and interiors were immaculate. The BEATLES show was the high point and should not be missed !
50,This was my second stay at The Mirage and truly it is my favorite pool in Las Vegas it has some much needed shade under the massive waterfalls but plenty of sun for those who want that. We love the location of this hotel also. We have stayed at many hotels in Las Vegas and The Mirage is one of our favorites. If you are visiting Las Vegas in the warmer months then this is the hotel to stay at for pool fun.
40,I’ve always enjoyed staying at the Mirage Hotel and Casino. I’ve stayed here over the last 20 years and will continue to do so. Great food great service overall and located to many other amenities around the strip.
30,"Warning Very Long review from experienced guest: (Please read it to the end)    I would like to start by saying that I truly have loved staying at this property and have done so for over 20 yrs. The pool is beautiful the property is small and you can get where you need to go very quickly and easily. Everything you need is available on site. We have come to know what to expect and usually come prepared.  However this trip was Disappointing to say the least. I was travelling with my husband my adult son and 2 of his friends and 2 other couples. We had several rooms. 2 Rooms were in my name. 9 in my party total. We arrived on Wed the 21st and were booked for 7 nights. Since our flight was delayed over 5 hrs and we traveled from the east coast we arrived at 1 am Vegas time. very tired. Check in process was fine 2 clerks at the deskquick and easy and asleep by 2am.    As tired as I was on Day 1 it began at 6am. Why you might ask? Because I know from years of experience that If I am not at the pool in line at least 1 1/2 hrs before the 8am opening I will not be able to select the seats we like let alone even find an available seat. So I arrive in line(where by the way we always meet lovely people who are as experienced as us in this odd vacation ritual at the Mirage)and as I patiently wait the line begins to grow and grow as it gets closer to the 8am opening.. The security guard opens the Secret Garden doors so the line can travel down the pathway rather than circle around and around blocking the doors to the inside. At 8am sharp after showing my key and having my bag checked I make a run for it around the waterfall to the pool edge and quickly claim 4 chairs( not 9 as the number of guests in my party) I only take 4 because I know some other guests will be grateful they have seats at all. The day begins and ends at the pool for us. The husbands call after golf to ask us to help carry some cases of water beer snackscooler etc. I head to the side lobby door where we ask the Bellman if he could assist us or if we can utilize the bell cart and we are told he can bring it upstairs for 20.00 but we can't use the cart. What? Yes because it was not a piece of Luggage there would be a fee..no thanks . Carried it ourselves. Please keep in mind I had already purchased and brought with me a small coffee pot coffee cups and since there is no refrigerator in the room we needed a cooler for Milk water juice and of course Beer since the drinks at the pool range from 8.00 for a small Club Soda to 26.00 for a large Margarita..and by the way the small coffee at the coffee shop is almost 6 dollars. Be prepared either way in 110 degrees you will be thirsty and should be hydrated!  Day 2: Same 6am alarm same line at the pool. HOWEVER upon the opening of the gates this day as I rounded the corner I could see the chairs I have been sitting in for 20 years and the chairs I sat in the day before were now RESERVED and considered premium seating and would require a 35.00 fee/day if I wanted to sit there from this day on. WHAT? There were 12 chairs with the reserved signs on them in that section. Since there is already the OASIS pool with reserved seating and cabanas you can reserve and chairs on the far end of the pool where the tanning ledge is I could not imagine there were now more chairs that would be unavailable to guests that just want a chair without reaching further into their pockets. As a hotel guest shouldn't you be entitled to a chair at the pool? Without paying or without having to stand in line for over an hour? I went to who I was told was the Pool area manager and will admit i was not polite. (i did apologize) I was told simply it was a corporate decision and out of their hands. Nothing they could do. I asked why they could not have at least notified the quests on Thurs that were sitting there that the next day we could not sit there unless we wanted to pay.. I was told there was no way to let guests know this.. (fyi there are signs about every other thing everywhere) So we sat and waited and watched the poor people that came to the pool to late to get a free seat and were bullied into paying to sit there. By 2pm they were sold. I just do not understand how this resort could be so hard up that they need to Sell seats to make 400 bucks yet the pool restaurant and pool food service is over at 3pm when the pool is still packed until at least 5 or 6 pm.(i assume since you don't have to pay a staff to manage the chairs and you can let your restaurant staff go home and not pay them it is a better option)even If is at the expense of your loyal guest's experience. At this point of my trip I was just so disappointed and disgusted. It was just one more thing on top of No coffee pots in the room no fridges having to carry Ice back and forth to the room( my room was at the end of the long hall) paying 66.00 for 2 Margaritas and 20. for bell service and not to mention the 40.00 ""resort fee"" for which you get Wi fi in the room and at the pool (they actually list it twice as part of the fee as if it is two separate things).. and then this.. ridiculous. The Mirage is supposed to be a 4 star resort yet the guests are nickeled and dimed to death.. Whats next 5.00 for towels or 20 for a shade chair? maybe I should not give them ideas..  We continued our stay and found alternative Free chairs which were now being sought after by several guests all of who used to sit in the now Premium seats.. it was a sad and yet comical situation. By the way if you are a fan of the shade you'd better set your alarm as well those seats go quickly and I will not be surprised if at some point are deemed Premium as well.. We witnessed a lifeguard get off his stand to remove two guests that just sat in the premium seats with their regular standard towels and who obviously had not paid. The chairs were basically sold each day by day end on the weekend but there were several unsold on Monday and Tuesday. We witnessed several ppl in a group buying 1 chair or a couple buying 1 chair and sharing.. We did have a lovely Pool Server named Katelyn she was pleasant worked very hard was happy to do her job! Ali at the front desk was also very nice and helpful as was the Housekeeping staff on the 17th floor. The rooms are in need of an update although they were very clean and comfortable compared to other MGM properties they seem outdated but part of the charm of the Mirage. Our room was facing the Volcano and the atrium dome and you could hear and feel the Volcano erupting each night until 11pm and there are no light blocking drapes so it was fairly light in the room at night. It was quiet on the floor especially at the end of the hall. We ate in California Pizza Kitchen the Burger place Carnegie Deli and the Italian Restaurant and all were very good with good service some pricier than others but standard for Vegas in General. (also dined at the Top of the World at the Stratosphere which was outstanding! $$$$ but worth every penny and a view you will never forget!)  We did report the deficiencies we found to the Director of Guest Experience and she did reach out to us with concern and offerings to satisfy us and while we appreciate her offerings it does not rectify the problems and the feeling of being bullied into spending $$... the pool line situation has been going on for 20 years and it just gets worse as repeat guests realize the routine. I honestly do now know what the solution would be for this but there has to be a better way. The premium seating just makes it worse as there are now less seats altogether. No one seems to care about the guests just the bottom line. It is exhausting honestly it is not a relaxing vacation as it should be. MGM needs to do a better job. We live in NJ and frequent the Borgata so we are partial to MGM Properties. We did go to ARIA and Bellagio and may need to make a change next year. As I stated earlier I love this resort and the pool is the best on the Strip and the situations I mentioned were addressed with the Guest Experience Director. She was very understanding and did her best to help satisfy and it was much appreciated it is not just about satisfying us for what happened it is about correcting the problems and situations going forward. I can see after 20+ years the problems still exist and are worse than ever. As I get older I cannot keep going to bed at 11 (does not leave much gambling time since I have to go to bed to get up for the pool line) Getting up at 6am and running a marathon to get a chair by the pool on my only vacation each year I am exhausted and need a vacation when I get home. I hope this does not deter but just prepare you should you choose to experience this Property."
20,Very expensive per night when the rooms are dirty and smell bad and you can't even put your own sodas or water in the fridge because they have the fridge door locked by their liquors from the bar :(. so sad and boring.
50,Stayed here with my husband for 4 nights for my 30th Birthday. The hotel is amazing couldn’t fault. Location is great. We could see the pool and strip from our room which was lovely. Pool was really big and never had a hastle getting a lounger. Went to the buffet for breakfast one morning it had a big selection of food. Also visited the burger restaurant which was nice. Will definitely return!
50,Thank you for another great stay! My husband and I and our family enjoyed our stay again this year. The Mirage pool area is the absolute best. Dave and his crew at the Dolohin Bar will take good care of you.
40,this is a great location the pool is amazing. the hotel is clean and the staff friendly. The check in is hectic. the Bare pool is a joke lol dont go there. The food at the main pool is good. the pool closes at 7 that was not cool it was 103. they should add more waitress at the pool and some live entertainment that would be great.
20,Make sure you go over your bill before you check out. We were Charged over $60 b/c my kids opened fridge to see what was inside and picked up  Pack of trail mix. Nothing taken which housekeeping can attest to but charged us for all. When I told checkout clerk she took the charges off without confirming if I was telling truth or not so clearly just hoping people don’t notice. apparently fridge and bar are weighted but first time in Vegas so we didn’t know ...just knew it wasn’t free. Not enough staff for check-in/ check out on holiday weekend but staff was good. Working on pipes so we were temporarily without hot water in sink and no water in shower...sent to the spa to shower. Location and bell staff good.
40,Large spacious room. We arrived later in the evening and check in was smooth and easy. Loved the hotel and location. We love getting out and walking and venturing around. Great location mod strip and you can cross the street right out front. Huge pool!
30,The staff was very friendly and efficient. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous with a really awesome dolphin habitat and feline sanctuary. I thought the room was beautiful and spacious but very dusty and moldy.
30,Average room. Expected better from MGM group. The staff what great and helpful. The room smelled and AC struggled to work. Paid for a strip view however got a room to the back of the hotel. The stay was average but think of trying a different hotel next time.
20,Explained already in previous answers though Checkin experience was not good at all this lady at the front desk was behaving like she was doing a favor to us giving two adjacent rooms while I specifically I asked for it during booking.
10,Dirty towel. Take too long for check in and out. Staff is unfreindly. Smell too much marijuana every where even on hall way to bed room. We got cough cause too much smoke. Should have smoke area. Dont suggest
20,"To start with.....prior to leaving NJ I had to pack a coffee pot and mugs because you do not provide such luxuries in the rooms. This has nothing to do with cost just an everyday convenience my husband and I have become accustom too. Rooms dated the bathroom very small. We quickly unpacked and headed over to the Walgreens to buy a cooler no refrigerator provided by the hotel unless you wanted to pay $7 for a bottle of water. yhe warning that if you so much as touch something you would be charged gave me a land mine type of feeling and we never even opened the frig again. We are curious however as to what is in the ""sex"" box? You can imagine my surprise when my friends told me they would be waiting on line at 7am to get a seat by the pool. The FUN finally started when my friends were told the chairs they had sat in for the past 30 years were now a upgrade at the cost of $35 a day......oh and if you wanted to sit in the shade that would be $35 a day also or a 7am pool line visit. My concerned escalated when a lifeguard jumped down off his chair and ran over to the ""premium"" seats to remove regular guests who sat in the ""premium"" seats without the upgraded towels required to indicate the purchase. The pool was full of swimmers at the time. The bell hop who insisted getting paid $20 in order to help bring supplies from Walmart to the room only added to the total negative experience of the stay at your hotel. We refused the extortion attempt and lugged everything up ourselves."
50,Amazing time! The hotel and the pool was beautiful. The restaurants were great. The food was delicious. The staff was amazing. I enjoyed my trip emencely. I will definitely will be coming back to this location!
30,Blackjack dealers were rude and I was promised a volcano view room and that did not happen. Other then that great hotel and good service. I wish I would of gotten my volcano view room. But overall was a good stay
10,Of the 7 times ive been to Vegas with 5 of those times at The Mirage I must say this was the worst. I booked this stay 140 days in advance. I booked a Hospitality suite and then a 2 queen was comped to us as well. This stay was for our grandsons 21st birthday. We had requested that both rooms have champagne. (That never happened). We told our grandson not to eat any of the refreshment bar items because we will be charged for them. He didnt eat any of it. Guess I should have said dont even touch them because I check out I was charged for every item on the refreshment bar (nearly 200 dollars). So since we were charged for them please send me all those items that were claimed to be consumed by us. Another biggy was upon booking I paid a deposit and was told that the balance was due at checkin. I asked several times if there would be any hidden fees that are due upon checkin and each time I was told NO by the staff that just the remaining room balance is all thats due. But upon checkin I was also told I would have to put up a 300 dollar security deposit. So after becoming a Pearl member of M-Life this was the treatment I received. The Mirage robbed me of over 500 dollars
50,Very pleasant and clean hotel. Beautiful Convention center friendly staff. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Bring a jacket if attending a convention as the rooms get real cold. The refrigerator is pre loaded so you have no room to keep your personal items cool
30,Ok stay. Room had a dirty wash cloth in it when we got there the staff missed. Resort fees are just going up. Pretty soon will be $80 per night. No free play if using comped rooms? Cheap. Disappointed all around with mlife/myVEGAS. All the work you do to get the comps then can not use how you planned when you get there
50,Excellent location on the strip. The Casino is very clean and has a great atmosphere. Hotel room was very comfortable. Can’t wait to come back and stay at the Mirage. The pools are amazing and a wonderful place to relax
50,Exceptional service very professional staff enjoyed our entire experience . We are planning to come back next summer for this fall. Continue the great job we appreciate all your staff did for a great vacation
30,We were there for honeymoon but did not receive any comps or something a little extra. If I did not ask for other rooms available we could have been spending our honeymoon on the 5th floor. The front desk gave us 21st floor with 2 double beds for our honeymoon stay. Kinda disappointed.
50,The Mirage Hotel & Casino offers great rooms at a reasonable price. The staff was very friendly from check-in to room service. The view of the strip and fire show was really nice to have. The food was awesome and most restarants stay open really late. Over all awesome time at Mirage Hotel and if you get a chance the shows are awesome as well.
40,This was my first time staying at the Mirage and didn’t have high expectations due to its age and the fact that I was getting a comped room; however I was pleasantly surprised by my entire stay. The room was updated quiet and large- plenty of room for a family of four. The pool area was great- lots of seating and easy to get to from our room. Only con was how cold the pool water was but the hot tubs made up for that! Lots of options for food/ quick bites close to our room. Elevators were fast. Hotel smelled nice ( can’t say that about many Vegas hotels!). I appreciated that not only was our floor non smoking but the entire wing was non smoking- great since we were traveling with our children. I will definitely come back to the Mirage!
10,The tower suite was spacious but not worth the price. The resort had a water main break during our stay and we had no shower/room water for an afternoon. Then when water was fixed it was never right. Shower water went from freezing cold to boiling hot ridiculous! The front desk staff and phone reps are bot on the same page both tell you different things. The pool has inadequate amount of chairs for guests unless your willing to pay for a chair! Just overall not the best resort/hotel.
50,The staff at the Mirage were extremely friendly! The hotel is centrally located. Walking distance to Ceasers Palace The Venetian and other casino's. Easy access to shopping!! Pool is AMAZING! Beatle's Love is an AMAZING show all new.
10,The suite was spacious and a small fridge is open for use. But that's about it! Check in is a joke. Phone customer service is ghetto! The pool chair hunting is a nightmare. The water main broke while we stayed at hotel and had no water for showers for part of a day then the remainder of stay the shower water would go from freezing cold to boiling hot. The suite cost at this hotel is NOT worth it.
50,We went on this trip as part of a huge family holiday there were 10 of us in total ranging from 18-80. This hotel was spotless from the second that we arrived - most of us had never been to Vegas and were blown away even simply by the hotel reception. We arrived at about 10pm but the places was still very lively with staff on hand to help. Once checked in to our 4 rooms the lifts were great as specific lifts only go to specific floors which avoids having to wait a long time. The rooms were a great size very spacious and well lit with a good size bathroom. From our window we could see Caesars palace which was a lovely view. The room was clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. We had a free unlimited buffet ticket per person included and the food was fantastic from the buffet restaurant. A great choice of foods including Italian Chinese American etc. The pool was also wonderful very large with more than enough sun beds for everyone (as a group of 10 we were easily able to sit together). Plenty of staff were around serving drinks handing out towels etc. The were lots of shops in the hotel including gift shops clothes minimarket coffee shops - plenty to choose from. Taxi's are available constantly we always travelled by limo as it worked out cheaper for a large group. The hotel is close to several of the other popular hotels including Caesars palace and the Venetian. The casino was also great - I am 25 but have only ever dabbled in gambling. The staff were helpful with teaching us some of the rules and were actually trying to help us to not lose money which I didn't expect. The staff were a good laugh and again the rinks were flowing constantly. I didn't feel pressured to throw money away at any moment. I highly recommend this hotel it was perfect for what we were looking for.
40,While I don't see the value due to the resort fee on top of paid parking they were helpful when I had a minor medical. They directed me to their list of medical providers which was a big help. They delivered that list to the room so that was a help.
50,This was my second time staying at The Mirage this year and I had a great time. The young lady at check in was very friendly and nice to talk to. I always find it far better to talk with a person at check in that have deal with a computer during check in/out and she didn't let me down. Very nice and professional. The room was very clean and quiet. The slot machines were a little looser this time around and that's always a good thing.
40,First time staying at the Mirage. We were very surprised at how nice it was. One of the older hotels but our room didn’t feel like it needed renovation. Should’ve asked for a strip view but maybe next time. Also liked the slot selection and a lot were affordable. Great trip all around. Pool is fantastic
20,Request for management never happened. I could not reccomend Mirage. Many of casinos/hotels are better. I even asked at checkout for a manager to call me nothing has happened. I am very disspointed!!
20,nice hotel but a questionable casino operation in both the table games and the slot machines. I Played dozens of slots of every imaginable type of slot machine. While I was getting pounded with not even winning low money payouts I made sure to scan and observe fellow gamers and to my astonishment there were no players winning even marginal payouts. I encountered player after player that was very disappointed about the casino expereince.
40,Nice Las Vegas hotel in good location. Only complaint is that WiFi in room would drop randomly. I was on a business trip so this made it difficult to stay logged into my work VPN. Good at the pancake restaurant was very good. Bed was comfy. Bathroom was clean and had nice smelling shampoo. Room furniture could use an update as the chair looked a bit worn. A couple of stains on the carpet that looked like a stiff scrubbing with cleaning solution or bleach.
40,Nice spot..could use some food closer to convention area.Generally good food except Heritage steak ...was not impressed.Casino was fun..Pool looked great just didn't have time to use. Good location for other shows and restaurants
50,Super comfy beds and pillows which is a must for me. Great location smack dab in middle of strip. Clean casino and great food as well. Just wish they had $5 Blackjack. Staff was great as well easy eager to help with anything.
20,My partner and I have stayed at the Mirage a number of times now and each time the room has gotten worse in terms of things not working properly and the quality of the cleaning. We always find old makeup on the bedding and last year even dried blood which is disgusting. The food at the buffet was not appetizing and made us both sick. Other than the pool we did not have a great experience at Mirage these last two times.
40,Stayed at the Mirage the hotel was clean however the pool seemed to be on the cool side would have liked it warmer. Staff maintains the rooms nicely. Restaurants were good the deli was very affordable
40,Beautiful pool area.  Location is awesome  I liked the map of the Mirage resort provided to me during check in  Drinks alcoholic and non are overpriced. Carnage deli was a big disappointment.  Beds need to be replaced and bathroom ventalation fan didn't work very well .
50,The Mirage Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas Nevada is a nice facility located on the Las Vegas Strip. It is a short walk to three shopping areas and many wonderful restaurants. Price per night is mid-range for other hotels in the area. Highly recommended to try at least once when staying in Las Vegas.
50,I always (usually) choose stay here when I’m planning a trip to Vegas. It feels like my 2nd home. The casino is always clean the rooms are exceptionally nice and I’m a M life rewards member that gets the free parking perk 😉. I’d recommend to everyone!
50,Wonderful time great stay..loved the Mirage. It’s in a terrific spot located on the strip around all the other casino and resorts. The casino was beautiful with friendly working staff. The restaurants we went to were outstanding. Our room was clean and well kept with no issues. The shower had terrific pressure and was fantastic. I slept wonderful. It was a cozy clean room.
40,Beautiful decor. Casino area was very open and not overly crowded. Restaurants offered great food choices. Pool area was gorgeous and crowded without feeling stressed. Pool staff/servers were extremely friendly and always checking up on us.
20,"Room was ready late dining service was poorly serviced check-in line were to long. Aside from that it was a clean place and bell boys were friendly. Need to make the ""bare"" pool bigger. Casino does look very nice."
30,Beds great black out was great first room they offered looked right at a WALL had to move rooms. Staff very friendly. But maids took out glass collection that we put with our things. So WATCH your Belongings
20,This was a family vacation and the rooms were a big disappointment. The pool and the resturants were fine but way overpriced for food and drinks. Five drinks came to 90.00 which is too high so needless to say we only had one round of drinks.
50,We have been going to the mirage casino for the last 10 years. The hotel hostess was incredible Celina stepped up to the plate and made sure we had a incredible trip. The service was very consistent with a five star resort. The cleanliness of the room was impeccable with attention to detail the rooms seem to have been remodeled and very nice decor. The location is not far from any of the MGM resorts which is nice to move around from time to time. Room has very nice mattress so when I went to bed I felt completely relaxed and fell a sleep. We only wish we could rate higher because they are very professional and personal from the limousine driver which called ahead and had my wheelchair waiting as we arrived.  Thank you so much for making our dreams come true. Very proud to say we will stay at the Mirage the next 10 years.  See you next time    Karen & Jerry
40,Stayed at Mirage for a business event. Hotel rooms were comfortable spacious enough shampoo conditioner body lotion and bar soap provided. Curtains did a good job of blocking light. Meals were on par with other Vegas hotels. Overall a good hotel.
30,"We recently decided to stay at the Mirage for a work trip that we brought the kids on. I picked the Mirage because we had been there back in 2011 and were happy with it it felt like a nicer hotel. I've been to Vegas probably 30 times and personally never been one to stay on the strip too crazy. We chose the Mirage for the Pool and the ""resort"" factor. I wanted to be able to entertain my kids without having to leave the property and have various food options on site. Not have to fetch the car navigate Las Vegas Blvd summer heat etc.. I made it work but it fell below my expectations sadly.    Pros:  • The pool is solid and clean.  • The cafe by the pool is acceptable because of it's convenience  • Parking situation. If you pay for valet it's good at any MGM property for the day so you can go to other locations and not have to pay valet again. Worked out great for taking kids to shark aquarium at Mandalay Bay.  • Hospitality and staff are great as you would expect.    The not so good:  • Smoking. It's listed as a ""non smoking"" property but if there's a Casino you can smoke and you have to walk through the Casino to get to the rooms and the HVAC smoke mitigation is not working well. And.... it's really common to see some ""bro"" smoking in the hallway of the non casino areas. They don't enforce the non smoking.    • The property feels beat. Our first room we checked into had clearly been smoked in and had a faint mildew smell throughout we moved rooms.    • The food situation is poor. I like to eat on he healthier side and it was pretty much impossible at this property. When I""m paying close to $200 a night I want more options than Aramark Food Services of America Cisco - feel me? Lipstick on a pig.    •  All the photos of the pool with the waterslide they took it out. Not a big deal but made my kids bummed.    I'll be searching for the good non casino stay that's better for a trip with family in tow and a great pool. Will post my findings when I do find it (Tahiti Village?)."
40,This hotel was clean with a good central location on the strip. I’ve stayed here before and will probably stay again. I was disappointed this time in our room. Terrible view. Problem with hot water one night. Hallways are extremely cold. Bed was comfy and casino was nice. Overall I was happy. I’m easy to please.
10,The room and decor was tired and dated. Handicap access at parking was seemingly non existent. Be prepared for a long distance journey from parking to hotel / casino. Pool not open in the evening  why is this ? Being able to relax in the pool would have been nice  but nope. Concierge and front staff were bent on presenting show deals and booking activities. Parking was was terrible
40,Great choice for vegas. Good food choices and great pool  EVerything is expensive here but thats to be expected. Didnt smell at all which was a concern with kids. Check in was a bit long but it was fine
50,Mirage situated in the center of the strip  is a wonderful hotel/casino.  It maybe a little older than the flashy newer ones but it give you a feel of the original classy places in Vegas. Great rooms fair prices great staffand a good variety of places to eat and enjoy people watching!
30,"Great games show and restaurants. Rooms had nothing to offer. Doors allowed a lot of noise from the hallways. There was no fridge in the room just a mini bar which had off-putting signage guests would be ""immediately charged"" if they touched anything inside the mini bar and additionally charged if they placed anything inside the mini bar fridge. You can tell the rooms is where the hotel management cuts costs for the property. Check-in took half an hours in a short line of about 6 people with 3 staff on hand because they had over-booked rooms. Check-out was impossible since the line overflowed out of the queue so we just dropped the room key and went."
50,The Mirage location is in the middle of the strip thereby making accessibility to various venues an easy one.  The sights and sounds of waterfalls within the hotel and out at the pool are most welcoming. A pool area that provides both sun and shade. Staff are friendly and helpful. HIGHLY recommend this hotel!
50,Our stay at the Mirage was good food friendly and welcoming staff good entertainment and a great overall vacation. The location is central to a lot of activities and we were able to see a lot just walking around.
40,very nice place.. great view from the 24 th floor of the strip . easy checkout and great casino.. love the room and the pool is very relaxing .. the food selection was great . lots to see and do and the Rhumbar is very nice to relax in
50,The Mirage was a great jumping off point for my 4 day stay in Vegas which was centered around the Def Leppard show at Planet Hollywood. The Mirage IMO is the most elegant hotel in all of Vegas truly catering to their guests every need. Room was perfect food was fabulous gorgeous pool and scenery and a Casino which is not intimidating.
50,Stayed for 3 nights. Great location . Such a comfortable bed and good size bathroom! Shower and separate tub. The pool is great just could use some umbrellas due to it being so hot out and could not stay in the to long
40,We were only there for a very short stay to see a show but I liked the hotel and thought our room was very nice. Not super deluxe but comfortable bed and nice decor. Would have given a 5 except that housekeeping banged on our door twice the morning of our checkout which was super annoying!
50,Ha a great trip the hotel was clean and the staff friendly.The food in the hotel was good had all three meals in different locations. The buffet was good lots of choices. Would recommend this hotel to friend and it was in a great location. The staff of the table game for excellent. The whole staff is very friendly
20,"There are many things to recommend this hotel - particularly the location. But there are a number of things that have really decreased our enjoyment of staying here which we have done for many many years. First we are Platinum MLife members a level that is not easy to reach. Do we get good room assignments? You would think so - and you would be wrong. The last two times we've stayed here we were assigned a room on the 3rd floor overlooking the ""pool"" which in reality means overlooking a roof covered with air-conditioning units. They said nothing else was available. Then what rooms were they assigning to the 50+ people waiting in line to check in???? I can't believe they were all 3rd floor rooms! Until a couple years ago at this level we would get complimentary suite upgrades (several years ago) or at the very least a good price on an upgrade. I understand that suites are sometimes all booked up (although I would think they would set aside a few on hold for Platinum members) but the best room they can come up with is a 3rd floor overlooking a roof?!?!  Besides this very frustrating start to our stay the room itself was less than satisfying. The furniture is beginning to look very worn out - many nicks and scratches and the pillows (no longer feather like years past) were well past their prime.  In summary Mirage is not what it used to be at all and really doesn't value it's high level MLife customers. It's a shame as we used to love it and we definitely like the location. Not sure I am ever going to stay here again."
50,The hotel is pristine and very comfortable. We enjoyed the dining and tried several restaurants all of which were very good. The staff bent over backwards to make our stay enjoyable and the atmosphere was wonderful. We will be back.
40,"We've visited Las Vegas several times over the years. We were very disappointed in how much the hotel is charging customers. We paid $50 a day for ""resort fees"" on top of the nightly rate. A cup of coffee can be as much as $5 and it cost us $15 a day to park at the hotel. I guess gone are the days when hotels/casinos provide services to their customers leaving more money for gambling? We won't be back."
10,Checked in at hotel at 12. 2 other parties with us received rooms at 1 and 3. We called at 3 about our room. Was told between 3-7 our room would be ready. 6 comes around so we call the check on time frame. Got told our room had been ready but we didn't receive the text message. Get our room number and get there.... neither key works for that room. Call back downstairs and get a security officer to come up after 20 minutes. Open the door and its a double queen instead of the king we booked. So after another call downstairs we get moved to the king room we booked and was told our resort fee would be taken care of and $100 room credit. Well we go to check out and guess what? We get billed for the resort fee because it was only noted to be covered for one of the nights not both. The girl at the desk was acting like I was lying and was just trying to get free stuff. Overall experience with this hotel was of the lowest quality and we have stayed at many other resorts in Vegas.
10,Stayed at the Mirage due to the popularity of the name. Was not satisfied from the beginning. Check in was not as expected mobile check in did not work out at the time of our arrival. Get to the room and the vinyl head board had a rip in it room was out of date needed updated. Nothing was complimentary as with other hotels: No coffee/tea No bottled water (unless you paid for it at a ridiculous amount also had to pay for parking (self park and valet). Sleep was interrupted several nights by slamming doors in the hall. Also woke to a crashing glass outside our door one morning when my husband opened the door a maid was cleaning it up with no apology or explanation as to what happened. We stayed one night at Trump Las Vegas (we arrived earlier than our reservation) They had complimentary coffee/tea bottled water and parking was free.  A resort that nickle and dimes you to death is not a place I would want to stay again.
10,Simple review short we did not get the room type that we prepaid for. We stayed in two different rooms this trip and the card reader kept failing on both rooms this required trips back to the lobby every time. Never wasting money here ever again
20,I've stayed at lower costing hotels that were much better than this.  Best experience was with the concierge purchasing tickets for the Beattles Love show. Worst experience was the check-in. Incidental fees and lack of explanation regarding room and extra charges.
30,The rooms are clean but not well maintained. Window curtains don't close all the way rooms are very very dark with all lights on bathroom sinks don't work properly. And lamp shades are stained with liquids. USB ports for charging electronics are so worn that a USB cord won't stay in or charge anything due to poor connections. And for the amount of money that I paid to stay in a top floor hotel below the suites.... I would expect more and better quality.
40,Very clean fun and more affordable option on the Strip. Plenty to do without being overwhelming like the Bellagio. Only complaint was the banquet room for our workshop was too cold. Recommend Osteria Costa and Carnegie deli for food.
30,This is a nice hotel it's in a great location on the strip. The ceilings are low though so getting to your room you have to walk through a crazy cloud of smoke. Rooms are kind of outdated too. The food is really great here and the convention center is nice too.
50,Great Hotel . We stayed in the stay well room . It was very relaxing and we enjoyed ourselves . Really close to the center of the strip . Staff was beyond friendly rooms were beyond clean . Definitely coming back boom
50,Great time. Excellent stay and would definitely recommend. The pool was great as well as was the dood. The Deli Japanese restaurant and the sports bar we’re all exceptional. The pool could use a better sound system and a few more cocktail servers.
20,The room clock wasn't functioning. The window view of the famous Mirage Volcano wasn't much to speak of. Too high and too far away to be spectcular. Long check-in. Even the inhouse phone was ackward to use had to get used to it. In room fridge was a joke just a rip off can't use it for personal use. $15 for parking each day. $37 resort fee each day nevered used the spa nor digital newspapers.
40,It’s a nice hotel that’s located right at the center of the strip and you can easily walk anywhere. Was expecting far worse from the reviews I read I actually enjoyed my stay and thought the hotel was decent for the price and it age. I thought it was well maintained in all aspects! You can’t go wrong staying here!!!
20,Overall I was disappointed in my stay. There were three people that tried to help me most of the staff used excuses . The management is a poor excuse of staffing. They were no there to improve my stay just to have an excuse why they cannot assist.
50,Nice hotel with a ton of amenities. Came here with my family for a weekend get away and we had a blast. Seeing Love is a must at the Mirage and would highly recommend taking psychedelic drugs before!!
30,Had cold water in the shower two mornings in a row. My friend also had cold water in her room next door and non vacuumed floors and a dirty wash cloth hanging from the towel rack. We both had to be moved from the 8th floor to different floors. Was unhappy about my experience here.
40,My family and I stayed at the Mirage in a Double Queen Room with Volcano View for 4 nights (Monday - Thursday). We checked-in on Monday at approximately 3pm and had nearly a 45 minute wait in line. Compared to the check-in lines we saw during our stay 45 minutes wasn’t so bad. The front desk clerk was personable and helpful directing us to the amenities the hotel had to offer and answering all of our questions. The elevators are through the casino and quite a distance away. The room was nice clean and well maintained although the bathroom is definitely on the small side. While we did have the Volcano view there was also a view of a lower rooftop and a partial view of the strip. The in-house restaurant choices are good with CPK being my favorite meal The Pantry being decent and the Cravings Buffet being a strong pass as with the exception of the French Toast none of my family was happy with the buffet’s quality. The hotel also has a Starbucks which offers all of the items normally found on their menu. I’d also recommend The Center Bar in the casino for good drinks and a great vantage point of the action around you. Be aware this is a resort in Las Vegas and the food and beverage prices at the restaurants and bars reflect this. Siegfried & Roy’s Secret Garden was a family favorite giving a little tranquility in the Vegas craziness and a nice chance to get reasonably close to the animals. The pool is large and never seems crowded even though the lounging area is filled with people....nice tropical feeling in the desert. The shopping area is somewhat typical of a vegas hotel with some high end offerings included. My biggest negative is the casino. The “pumped in” air freshener not only doesn’t cover up the smoke smell but is actually overpowering in it’s own right creating a mass of competing odors. Better ventilation could remove more of the smoke odor and make the air freshener unnecessary. The casino does have a large selection of games and tables however we didn’t see too many people winning jackpots. As my teenage son commented while walking along the main casino walkway “this place is depressing....no one looks happy....there were maybe two people smiling”. That is NOT a good review by an impartial observer. I understand no one’s happy when they’re losing money but it’s Vegas.....people should still be having a good time. My next casino issue is with the poor drink service while playing. On Thursday evening my wife and I played for over two hours with no drink service. I flagged down a waitress who literally stopped and looked at me before silently walking away and my wife also flagged down a waitress who said she’d be right back but never did. FYI: We noticed the nearby waitresses seemed to be congregating in a small area of slots and were continually taking drinks to the same gentlemen over and over before their drinks were even empty....I hope they were tipping good because I know I do when I get good service....something our waitress was never able to learn. To sum it up.....I gave this review 4 stars.....I would’ve given 5 stars but the sub-par casino and their waitstaff knocked it down. Stay at the hotel and gamble elsewhere!
30,The first part of my stay was delightful. The last day was awful. I had arranged for late checkout since I had a late flight. At 8:45 someone was knocking at my door despite the Do Not Disturb sign. I am disabled and was in an accessible room with roll in shower and shower chair. The chair broke while I was on it. It was scary and painful and I am still feeling effects. I did file an accident report with security. They offered to check me out I declined. After that 2 more people stopped to fill the mini bar and try to clean the room. I was unable to rest before my flight.  Now the first part of the stay was delightful but the last day really kind of ruined it for me. I'm actually surprised they kept charges on my bill. It was a comped trip though but to get a bill after that felt like an insult.
10,Our suite upgrade was horrible. Terrible smell of marijuana everyday from our neighboring room across the isle. The French style doors have a huge separation. Also our room smelled like pure mildew. I’m guess over flow of the tub onto the carpet.
40,We've stayed here many times. The rooms are clean they are large enough and the service is quite good. we have been to California Pizza Kitchen and also Carnegie Deli several times. They are both great prompt service food is amazing. We've had breakfast and dinner at the Deli as well as the cheesecake. People at the front desk are courteous but always so busy. Glad we are able to check-in at the short line. Makes a big difference. Only complaint... no in-room coffee maker :(
40,We've been staying there for years. Its a great location. We moved from MGM to the Mirage because it was closer to everything. You can walk to the Fashion Show Mall or to Caesars. I will say though its time to update the Mirage rooms.
30,Rooms are in dire need of renovation. Tile in shower moldy and/or cracked; carpeting dirty. If a guest even slightly moves the water or snacks on credenza the room is charged. I knew about the resort fees as I live in Las Vegas. When I booked the room several months ago my receipt indicated services and fees however when I arrived I was told the fees are not resort fees and I had to pay an additional $41.25 per night. I would have been fine with the cost if I was expecting it. So all in all $1000 for 4 nights is a bit extreme.
50,Spent a week long vacation at the Mirage casino and resort mainly enjoying the Oasis pool. The service was impeccable and it was so relaxing there in the private atmosphere. Felt like a tropical hidden oasis.
40,We stayed at the Mirage for 3 nights on the 21st floor. Electronic check in was easy and the $30 for early check in was well worth it. Location was perfect for our purposes which was exploring the city. The room was nice comfy bed however we thought our stay would have been improved had there been a fridge for our use as well as a coffee maker. Our view overlooked the volcano which for the first 2 nights we didn’t realize it was the fountain outside. Finally saw the show on night 3.  We enjoyed the restaurants and casino downstairs. We would stay here again
50,From the time my car pulled up I felt welcomed . The bellman was great the ladies at checkin in the VIP lounge were quick and friendly. The room was outstandingly beautiful great view super clean. The employees in the restaurants were also really friendly. Totally enjoyed my stay.
50,Hotel was nice and clean. Check in and check out lines are long. Checking in on the mobile app saved us some time.    Suggest down loading MGM resorts and check in that way. You can check via the TV if it was working
40,Overall a nice place to stay. Clean modern rooms nice pool good variety of restaurants and the staff was great whether at the front desk on the casino floor or in the restaurants everybody was friendly and helpful.  The casino was open and clean min bet mid-week was generally $10 or higher.
20,Staff was friendly for the most part the hotel was clean and taken care of. The internet kicks you off multiple times during critical work times multiple electrical outlets and USB ports at the desk area in room were not working. Added charges for use of in room refrigerator is over the top. The medical fridge was a nice compromise and I was very thankful until the cleaning staff unplugged it and forgot to plug it back in resulting in the loss of almost $1000 in injectable medication. The charges for basic things like water were outrageous. $18 for a bottle of water is just the beginning. Bed was comfortable and was able to sleep about as good as I would anywhere. Nothing special or over the top Definitely less than average.
50,I love staying at the Mirage. All employees in every area were friendly and helpful. I enjoyed the Cravings buffet and the Carnegie Deli sandwiches. I like the variety of the different type slot machines.
30,Room amenities lacking...no coffee maker...no microwave...extra refrigerator was not working well. Television couldn’t hold a channel (always shutting off after 4 minutes). Shower pressure was lacking...Bluetooth capability was nonexistent. Wifi was weak (but functional)
30,I traveled to Las Vegas for a birthday trip. Janet Jackson's 'Metamorphosis' residency was ending on my birthday and I wanted to be there to celebrate this special moment. I stayed at the Mirage hotel because I wanted a hotel that wouldn't be too far from the Park Theater.    When I arrived the hotel staff was friendly and explained how everything works to me. Upon arriving in my hotel there was a mildew smell and my neighbors were too loud for my liking so I asked to be moved to another room. The concierge assisted me and the second room was much better than the first one.    I like that the Mirage is near other restaurants so you have a choice of restaurants to eat at. I wish that the hotel residents would have had more complimentary access to the hotel offerings and not just minimal discounts. I enjoyed the pool area and I'm sure I'll visit the Mirage again to see the secret garden that they have.    I really liked my time in Las Vegas so I'm certain I'll be back there in the future!
50,We had a fantastic experience at the Mirage. Hotel staff is friendly and very helpful. Rooms are clean and well kept. The only thing I would like to see is more $$ choices to eat. Most restaurants are $$$
50,Clean very nice and cozy rooms worth every penny. Great variery of restaurants. Carvings is one if the best buffets on the strip and I enjoyed the room service from The Pantry food was sooo good. Staff was extremely helpful very kind. I loved the atmosphere at the casino had a lot of fun. Pool was relaxing very tropical. I would definitely go back and recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the area.
40,Second stay there first time was the one bedroom suite which much better than standard rooms but overall its nice not to big like others just need more food options  pool nice and calm... if looking for a time to relax and not to much parting then this the hotel
50,A wide open casino floor LOADED w/ great restaurants. A spacious retail space w/ a variety of shops (the wife got a Tat!). Excellent pool & comfy suites. The staff is excellent - friendly cheerful & helpful
50,Nice hotel in premium location. The best sun exposure pool period. Nice atmosphere with lots of trees and a very tropical feel... does not feel like your in a bustling busy city feels like your in a tropical country!
40,This was our third stay over the past couple years we love the location (centre strip) very easy to navigate and not overwhelming considering the size of it. The front desk staff are friendly and efficent.    We always book our games through MYVEGAS and even though they are free we always get a great room and have gotten a strip view each time. The rooms are getting close to needing a remodel as the bathrooms are wearing out. Our tap was loose and it was difficult to regulate the temp and there was a stain on the comforter. But no big deal. We will return!
50,"Amazing entertainment restaurants and shops. Loved the view of the volcano from our room. We saw The Beatles ""LOVE"" Cirque d Solei was absolutely amazing. Loved the Beatles Shop. The Costa restaurant (had a great vegan menu available as did Stack restaurant) was unbelievable. Make sure to ask for a vegan menu...it really helped. Pool is incredible."
40,This was our first time to the Mirage to actually stay here. We chose it for the pool. very tropical and pretty. You can rent premium chairs for $45 a day and not have to battle the crowds and get down there at the crack of dawn to get a spot. Great restaurants and fun Slots. Great location on the strip.
50,My husband and I made a couples trip out of his conference sessions at the Mirage. The conference areas were well appointed; be sure to bring a sweater or light jacket for the air conditioned conference rooms. We appreciated the friendly and helpful staff throughout the hotel and casino. Our room was spotless and the bed oh so comfy! If there was a way to give 4.5 stars we would for the cigarette smoke. We are certain if the hotel has updated its exhaust system but we found it difficult to visit the casino area for more than a few minutes. We visited another casino. Overall we would return to Mirage for the hospitality.
40,We had three nights travelling with a 10 year old room was small but sufficient service staff very friendly and accommodating. Pool was super cold but well serviced and monitored.  My only issue is the smoking everywhere and disrespectful drunks - but hey it is Vegas !!!  Resort had everything you need and good
50,This was our first time staying at the Mirage and we will definitely go back. The ease and convenience from checking our back until our room was ready to checking in and out was fantastic. The facilities and hotel is clean and inviting. Not too noisy. Everyone was pleasant and helpful and it was easy to get around the hotel and see everything they had to offer.
20,I booked this vacation because it was my parents 25th anniversary and my father was retiring this month.I thought Vegas would be a fun way to celebrate since both me and my sister are grown. I choose the Mirage because it was centrally located on the strip which made access to everything alot easier.    Check-in    We arrive to the hotel at 2pm i paid for early checkin for both my parents room and mine so despite there being a long line i still thought i was going to get a room. Nope no room available at the time but no biggie they refunded the $40 fee and i was okay with that. I was given a key so that when my room became available (notification via text or email) i could go straight up to my room. my mother chose the mobile check in option and was told the same thing except she wasnt given a key. About 330 i received a text that my room was ready. I head up to my room. my moms room isnt ready and when we get up to the room i call and i am told its still not ready... call back an hour later around 445 and i am told that the room still isnt ready and that it in total it takes 2 hours to clean a room. i say i dont understadn ive stayed at plenty of hotels ive even stayed at the MGM grand during a busy festival and still was given a room at check in. i said when is it going to be ready? she says with in the hour and i told her this is crazy what were suppose to do for 3 hours if my room wasnt ready? she says go explore vegas immedietly that pissed me off because we flew from BOSTON to LAS VEGAS its a 5 hour fliggth that we had to be up at 530 for we made reservations for 830pm at a restaurant and wanted to check in and rest before we got our night started. she had nothing to say to this she assured me it would be ready and that she would call when it was. like clock work at 530 she calls and asks us to come get the keys for my parents room. we get there and they have the nerve to tell us that she never checked in! how could we not have been checked in if two reps have told us that her room was being clean and all of our information have been input in mobile app! i was fuming they run my card and said its declined! why was it declined because they said i owed $1000 i asked for what? a $100 per day incidental i told them it was a debit card not a credit card which they could clearly see as it was in their hands and then they ran it for the correct amount and finally at 6:30 we were finally able to get into my mothers room. my mothers room was credit one nights worth of a resorts fee.    Housekeeping:    My grandmother and great aunts were housekeepers when they first came to this country so i always make sure to leave a tip every morning because i know how it can add up. the second day we were there i was sure to leave a tip in both my room and my moms when we came back the tips were gone and nothing was cleaned! we were told that if there is something on the bed they cant touch the bed BUT they didnt do anything and my mothers bed had nothing on it! all he did was leave the towels didnt change out the bag for the ice bucket didnt vacuum and didnt take the towels form the bathroom that were on the floors. we asked him to come back and fix the room since he had taken the money we came back 3 hours later room still wasnt clean.. we called front desk and an hour later another housekeeper came to fix the room and we were sure to give her a tip for coming back.    Smoking:    we stayed in a section of the hotel that was non smoking yet every morning on our way to breakfast we saw a women (room 22-106) smoking outside of her room. i spoke to security 2 days into our stay while they were on my floor taking care of a separate issue that someone was smoking. all they did was put in a air purifier. on my last day saw the same woman smoking. they did nothing. mind you there were a lot of family's staying on my floor and it wasn't fair that she was able to get away with this.    I wouldn't stay here again. the only advantage the hotel has is that they are central on the strip!
50,There was four of us on this trip August 15 through 22 we absolutely thought it was beautiful and the staff was absolutely wonderful and very thorough and very accommodating and I definitely would stay again thank you very much🌺😎
50,Had fun gambling in casino. Never stayed here but now this my favorite. The pool had great Mai Tai with whip pineapple. Oh so good! Enjoyed the dolphins Cove. Could have stayed there all day. Watched Browns preseaon in Sports Book. Those chairs so comfy!
30,I was disappointed for my first stay at the Mirage and I was very much looking forward to it also. Sheets were VERY dirty upon check-in. Manager did what he could to resolve the situation but I had to leave the room while the maid cleaned it another time. And I just wanted to lay down after my flight. The check in line was SO LONG so I recommend mobile check in. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. The pool is top notch! Had an ok time but the first day just kind of put a damper in the start of my trip
50,Best Vegas hotel great location and great experience buffet was great as well as the pool also have stayed here three times.east walk to any other hotel and u even walked to downtown. Service was great and the hotel is spot less
20,The over all problem with Mirage is that it was over priced. If I would have paid $100 or less a night for this room I would have given it a 4. At $250 a night I expect all staff members to be very friendly very clean room with great amenities. The biggest disappointments was a room that had many cleanliness issues and half the staff I came in contact with would rather not be there.
40,I stayed the weekend of Aug 17-18 2019. It was hot and I drove in from So Cal. I was eager to check in and rest up before heading back out for the evening. I know check in time is 3PM but I was hoping my room would be available a little bit earlier than that if not it should have been ready on time. With priority check open at 3 I was able to settle in a bit after 3:30pm. Room was as advertised again I wish it exceeded expectations. The pool is fantastic and the environment was great for lounging out in the sun. On top of that it is located in a prime spot on the strip. If you book here you will get a comfortable stay in a great location.
40,I have stayed over a dozen times at the Mirage and love the casino staff and location. But the room quality has dropped. The headboard had 3 chunks of vinyl missing from it. I expect better for what I pay.
50,Our stay at the Penthouse suite our afternoons at the poolside Cabana were sensational and our meals at the resort's restaurants were sensational. We did not want to come home. We look forward to coming back again for more sun and fun.
50,Will be staying again. Over the top experience with great staff and restaurants. Convenient to any where my wife and I couldn’t of picked a better place to spend our anniversary. They always have top class entertainment and shows.
50,If you stay in the Stay Well rooms on the 12th Floor you will love these rooms as they smell fresh you can set your ambient lighting for the room stocked in-room bar and other awesome amenities. These rooms are the best.
40,Great pool! Also service was good and the hotel is always clean . Location is great...walking distance to several attractions bars and restaurants. Rooms are clean although in need of some minor updating.
40,I was not too optimistic about this stay but our conference was held here so had to stay but was pleasantly surprised with the room service casino and overall experience. I have nothing bad to say about this hotel except the front desk where they didn't understand how to enter my Hyatt frequent number and they didn't even know that Hyatt is MGM's partner. The front desk lady had to call 3 different people before they could figure out how to enter the frequent traveler number.
50,Our August stay at this beautiful hotel was our fourth in the past few years. An excellent selection of restaurants along with pleasant staff members and a good casino layout provide the elements we enjoy in Las Vegas. We haven't tried the pool but it is gorgeous as are the landscaped grounds. The rooms are comfortable but the the bed pillows are more like giant cotton marshmallows than pillows. We always carry instant coffee for that early morning eye-opener and the hot water in the bathroom is hot enough to brew a cup. We are happy at The Mirage!
50,Just got home from Vegas . Stayed at the mirage a beautiful hotel our room was very clean and the bed and pillows were the comfiest I’ve ever slept in . I wanted to fetch them home . The pool area was lovely great pool loads of beds . And all the staff were very helpful and nice would definitely stay there again
50,Stayed here for 2 nights with our family.  Just came to have a weekend getaway before summer vacation was over. Our Room was nice and clean. Im very ocd when it comes to hotels and this was quite a nice experience! Will definitely come again.
40,I’m part of mlife and thought I would have free night stay . The resort fees are ridiculous. Especially if you’re not using their internet  tv pool etc . Other than that it’s a nice hotel . The mobile Check In was awesome and housekeeping.
50,This is the hotel to stay at. The hotel is very clean with excellent service. The staff are very polite and willing to assist whenever you need them. Our room view was very beautiful. I would like to Thank you for the great experience.
50,I enjoyed my stay at The Mirage. It was a great experience. Housekeeping was especially great and very kind. The front desk was also very accommodating and attentive. I will definitely stay here again In the near future.
50,Since it was so hot we stayed in the casino most of the time. Plenty to keep us entertained well- fed and socialized. Happy Hour at the Lobby Bar is a a daily necessity! Russ one of the bartenders is a true mixologist. He can fix anything you’d like.
40,We usually enjoy this well run Hotel. However on this particular trip we needed to spend some time around the beautiful and luscious pool area but the constant piped in music was unbearableit was annoyingly loud and tasteless certainly not conducive for reading or just relaxing; soft tropical or other background music would have been welcomed. In fairness we were satisfied as usual with other aspects of our stay.
40,Great staff dated hotel. Appears to be a older crowd. The pool is pretty nice too. There is a restaurant outside that has become one of our favorites. The bar staff is great. The cocktail waitresses can be very tough to find
50,I find the Mirage has the best staff they are all very helpful in all my needs i Will come back . I feel that the casino dealers were very nice  it was a good time i will go back again and bring many more guest
50,The Mirage is a great hotel centrally located on the strip. Nice big rooms that are clean and well maintained  Pool is nice with plenty of lounge chairs Rhumba in hotel has great refreshing drinks!  Buffet is good fresh and conveniently located in hotel.
30,Customer service experience was ok in this hotel from front desk to wait staff at the restaurant. It was not exceptional upset for the promoter Carlo he hooked us up in most of the club events. If you ever need a hook up on the guest list look for Carlo S. Rooms were decent but felt like it could of been cleaned/renovated better due to the mildew smell.
40,Stayed here for 4 nights and enjoyed each one immensely! I used the mobile check in and it worked wonderfully! Vania Cuevas deserves extra kudos for her friendly assistance at the mobile check in she was kind enough to upgrade us from a lower floor to a pool view and partial strip view because it was my first time staying at the Mirage and she wanted me to have a wonderful lasting impression and I do! The room is well equipped very cleancomfortable and nicely updated in my opinion. Everything worked well from the a/c to the iron shower and tv as well as the safe absolutely not one issue with the room at all. We ate at the Pantry the buffet (CRAB LEGS!!!!) and the Starbucks and all were reasonable and yummy. The pool area is awesome lots of seating and again helpful staff! I would also like to give a shout out to the MLife rep Lorena Lemanek for being so helpful as well.I was nervous with some of the reviews I was reading before coming and my experience was nothing but positive the hotel has plenty of food options beautiful amenities and friendly service and its a prime location on the strip! We will stay again and we will recommend!
50,Excellentate!!! The service from the entire staff: the bellmans the checkin desk the concierge the restaurants M-life and Julian at the mobile check-in. The only complaint (thank God I did not use it) were the mobile check-in. People were getting so frustrated with the devices I thought a few people were going to pick up the system and throw it.
30,I am really saddened by my current stay at the Mirage. I am on my second day into my 6 day stay with my mom and both of us agree we would never come back here. I will try to make the to the point.    We arrived and the wait was long but went fast the check-in help was amazing And we were off. This is where it goes down hill.    I feell it's easier to go into all of it and not too tell a story but just to list the issue we have had and experienced    The A/c in the room is not ok. It was so hot when we got to the room and we adjusted it but we've time we came back it was a sauna. The hall was way cooler so we left our door prompted open to cool it off. We left today again with it down and the windows closed to come back with them open and the air turned way up again so hot in the room we had to leave.    There is a fridge in the room but do not touch anything or there is an automatic charge. I know I have seen this before many places but there are NO prices for anything. One worker warned us not to move anything because even a bottle of water is $18. And once it's moved it's charged. If you use it for any personal stuff you must part a $50 restocking fee... What???? HOWEVER it tells you if you need a fridge for personal use call housekeeping and they will get you one. I called.... It was $35... A day. No thank you    There is not a bottle opener no wine glasses no coffee maker nothing    NO COFFEE!!!! 🤪    The bathtub/shower was clean but had been re sealed at some point I'm sure due to age.... but Did they clean it did they use calk???? No... IT'S Done WITH LIQUID NAILS!!!! all the way around.    When entering there is space to be this really lovely water feature with dolphins.... Well the dolphin statues are there but it is not running. Understand it's a huge display and empty with leaves in it it is so tacky and looks so run down. My mom even commented. She asked me was this our only hotel chose? And to please never book us here again.....    Understand I really wanted to like it but everywhere we turn it's bad again....ugh.    I hope this helps someone. I hope they can fix this place as it seems it was really nice at one time.    PS the ac issue is room 17032 so just a heads up.
50,Stayed on August 17th went for the Janet Jackson concert the hotel room service and dining were exemplary. I had never stayed but I am glad I did.Will definitely stay again especially for the value.
50,All around great property. Friendly staff; clean modern rooms; great location; full assortment of amenities (food shows attractions gaming); fabulous pool.  We have stayed in Vegas many times but this was our first stay at the Mirage. We will definitely stay here again!
40,"Love using the "" My Vegas"" app to redeem lots of fun things...definitely helps out... love the mirage overall and is always a pleasure to stay at. I would definitely recommend staying here again! and I cannot wait"
40,The mirage was a great hotel to stay at when visiting Las Vegas! The hotel is just beautiful and full of things to do on site. The staff is good the rooms are great and the nightlife is awesome. I would definitely stay here again but I do not agree with charging guests for parking.
50,We truly had a great time at the Mirage. The nature and greenery are so impressive. Everything smells so great like a luxury spa! We were so impressed with the staff at every level. My daughter absolutely loved the pool!
10,"When we got to our hotel room and pulled down the sheets we noticed they had black marks and hair in them. I called the front desk and asked to speak to a manager. They told me she was on a call but that she would call me back and they would also send housekeeping to redo the bed. I asked to please call me back as I need to know if there is a name I need to jot down while doing a survey. Housekeeping came and went and still no call. I called again and this time they out her on the phone and she proceeded to tell me that she found no need in calling me back as housekeeping already took care of the issue. She then sighed and said ""but it's fine"" as if she was doing me favor by taking my call. This made me upset and I told her it was not ""fine"" she had angry guest who the last thing she wants is to have housekeeping in her room at 5am and that it was her responsibility to give me a call back to make sure I was satisfied and especially after I specifically requested a call back. I asked for the name to the general manager and she said she couldn't give me any as she did not know who would be in in the morning (as if that would be hard to figure out). I asked if she could at least give me the name to one if them and she said no. Then I asked for her name and she said Amy.    I have no complaints about the front desk staff who were lovely and helpful only about the incompetent so called manager who lacks professionalism when dealing with guests."
50,The Mirage is our go to hotel on the strip - I've stayed here many many times and I will never stay anywhere else. We have a host and are always taken care of SO well. He came with our 3 teenaged kids this time and they had a blast in the cabana at the pool. The food is always amazing and the staff everywhere are all so polite and welcoming.
30,We booked this hotel first time. We were shocked to find this hotel old rooms our BOTH beds (queen beds) were torn at the Upholstery very disappointed. We also don't think that it's fair for a hotel guest to pay over night parking!. I understand if i am just visiting but as guests we should be treated better.  We will not be back
20,My room smelled like a moldy old basemen. I probably should have called to complain but I was so busy with work and it was for only for 2 nights.  Therefore my best choice is to stay at another hotel  Thanks
40,There was too much second had smoke in the casino that I had to pass through to get to my room each day. But other wise it was nice. It was a nice stay stay you have good blue berry pancakes in your breakfast restaurant
40,"I went to Vegas for a conference but ended up enjoying the other experiences that ""SinCity"" had to offer! I was pleased that each time we came back to our room it was superbly cleaned ! The front desk staff answered all my questions on where to go and how to check out without a wait! My 47th Bday will be a fun one to remember!"
20,1. In room bathrooms. :  Very old/unattractive  fan in bathroom making very loud noise  magnifying mirror light bulb burnt out  bathtub is old and disgusting  no shower gel  no shower caps  2. Not allowed to take any outside snacks to the pool  3. hostesses at casino are very rude  4. Paying for parking while paying for resort fee is outrageous
30,This is what I sent directly to them so I may as well post on here too.  The staff friendliness was always blunt and to the point. I wouldn’t consider hospitality part of what was experienced. The check in experience was for the most part great. The guest room however was the biggest let down of everything. The room is spacious but the room was definitely dirty. There was more pubic hair than I could count around the toilet base and near the base boards of the bathroom. Skimming over cleaning shouldn’t be allowed at a proclaimed 4.5-star hotel. Next the view was the worst. the view of the top of the building with a small glimpse of the mirage sign is by far not worth opening the curtains for. Then there’s the hallway. Walking 1/4 of a mile to the elevators from the parking garage then all the way down the 1/4mile hallway to get to the room just to find out that there’s no other way outside except all the way back down to the hallway makes me to never want to stay again. Then in the main advertising for shows on every one of the boards or digital ads says go to the box office or call this number. Well that’s all grand except the box office wasn’t even open at all and from the lady on the phone to the website the prices were not even the same. It’s like you guys can’t even get on the same page about things.
40,Overall experience good. Bed was very comfortable. The room was a great size. The decor was dated. The room was worn. The bathroom could of been cleaner. Towels in bathroom and pool were disgusting and stained. The pool was amazing though. Staff was friendly.
50,We had stayed a week in Las Vegas in another facility but decided to stay in more night in the Mirage. Boy are we glad we did. At no additional charge we we allowed to check in at noon instead of waiting until the normal check in of 3pm. The front desk gentlemen was very thorough and helpful. We proceeded to drop off our bags at the room and couldn't help but notice that the property was very nice with shopping on site and restaurants at every turn. The room very very nice and clean and we loved the view of the pool and strip from our room. We made our way down to the pool and boy was it a site to see. From beautiful palm trees to waterfalls it was the biggest and nicest pool I have seen. The waitresses in green outfits were there to take your order from food to appetizers and drinks. Be forewarned though that these items are quite expensive. My drink was $26 plus tax and tip. We made our way out into the water and spent over an hour playing under the waterfalls swimming around the pool and taking pictures. I couldn't help but notice the fun vibe. There were hundreds of people having a great time. The property has a number of activities from Cirque DU Soleil The Beetles the dolphin exhibit and much more. Overall we had a wonderful time and look forward to staying at the Mirage again next year.
50,The Mirage was the perfect place for our stay this summer. Its central location makes it easy to walk to many restaurants casinos etc. It is very close to the Link promenade which has quite a few very affordable dining choices. The Mirage also has by far the nicest pool I've ever been to. It is perfectly cool and the waterfalls are a beautiful added touch. We were there for a week and never once had to look for a seat at the pool (despite reading that people lined up for one... Weird)
50,Enjoyed this hotel! Parking was easy. Pool was fabulous! Location is perfect. Room was very nice and comfortable. I just wish that they would ban smoking inside. This is 2019. I don’t want to have to suffer second hand smoke.
50,Staff was Friendly and helpful.... Everyone working there was Happy and Smiling!  Food was terrific 👌  Room was Really Nice!!  Gift shop was very nice...  Our time at the pool was TERRIFIC!!! VERY CLEAN!
50,Stayed at Mirage this week for 3 nights and it was as good as always. Very friendly and helpful staff. Very clean room. Super comfortable bed. Enjoyed food at Pantry and Estoria Costa. Had a great time at the pool. Enjoyed the casino playing slots and roulette. I have absolutely no complaints! Highly recommend Mirage to people looking for a reasonably priced very nice place to stay at on the strip in Vegas!
50,My husband and I are MLife members and only stay at MLife properties. He had to work this time so my best friend and I came out for a girls trip. We had a blast! Room was nice and clean....stayed on 27th floor in Tower King....bathroom was very spacious. Double sink for all our stuff. We started our day relaxing at the pool. FYI...the pool opens at 8am.....go down and get in line before that to get your chairs. Fills up fast!! Frozen drinks were delicious but expensive....$25 in souvenior cup. We ate lunch every day at the Paradise cafe by the pool....excellent food!! My friend had the burger and I had the cobb salad.....delish!! Casino was nice...friendly employees and servers. We love coming here and playing Roulette especially when Yolly G. is the dealer. She makes the table fun and friendly. Always very engaging. We stay down here now because she is here. California Pizza kitchen was good also. Stopped by the Roasted Bean each morning for my coffee. I will stay here again.
30,We had to change rooms on first day due to lock malfunction and damages in room. The second room would never cool down. I also was told I had a $100 resort credit upon checkin but it was not reflected on the bill.
50,I've stayed at this property over a dozen times because it delivers on the things that matter to me. I like a high end spa and exercise facility as well as a private pool option. Quality drinks and food. Sizable rooms.
50,Beautiful Hotel in great location on the strip. Loved the Secret Garden Experience. Lunch service at our event was the best each and every day. Friendly helpful staff as well as good security too. Thanks for a worry free stay at a fine hotel.
50,Great food very clean and excellent staff. Met friends there for vacation and was very enjoyable. Pool is well maintained I only wish they would open earlier for us early birds. I went down at 7:00 am and there was already a line of over 50 people waiting to get in at 8:00 a.m.
10,Pillows smelled... Service was bad... Breakfast in the room we in plastics plates like McDonald's for 50 dollars. Old rooms and doors wouldn't close. I wouldn't recommend this hotel. Try some place else
30,Long wait at checkin (albeit shorter than at the Bellagio some days earlier) but very friendly staff.  We had a 'StayWell' room which was modern and equiped with some 'health' gadgets. A nice touch but I would have liked some other amenities like a coffee maker or useable fridge.  Quiet airco - something which we didn't have at the Bellagio.  Very nice but crowded pool area
50,Good large clean rooms with friendy staff to assist with all services. A long on checking in so I checked out early no problem and no line up. Nice pool area and easy to find your way around the hotel   would have being nice to take a little winning but anybe next time.
50,Great place we are here multiple times per year. Staff is phenomenal. Rooms are great. Defiantly stay here and enjoy the property and staff.  Trip advisor is irritating making me come up with 200 characters.
10,Save the money and try other properties around the city. The service I received was not worth the money. Room was dirty shower did not drain windows has fingerprints on them floor wasn’t vacuumed and the a/c said 65 but the room wouldn’t get under 68. I had to leave the door open because it was cooling in the hallway then the room
30,The pool is phenomenal but other than that I wasn’t as impressed as I was with some of the other resorts on the strip. Our room was “an upgrade” yet no different than regular rooms except it was on 25th floor and very last room down the corridor so it was very far from elevator
50,It was for my August 12 birthday. I brought my daughter grandchildren and girlfriend. We dine mostly there except for on my birthday. Food was great and reasonably priced with lots of selections. Gambling was also very good as they had all my favorite machines. Staff was always saying hello and smiled. It is just a friendly place to stay in Las Vegas.
30,The hotel room was very nice and spacious however batchroom was very basic and frills-free with a shower with very strong stream which could not be regulated towels felt quite worn out. Pool are was very pleasant and clean accessible for the guests only kept the busyness at an acceptable level. A few nice shops inside and good selection of restaurants and bars. Overall a nice place to stay and in a good location. I was disappointed that it has not offered free water and items in the fridge were not surprisingly very pricey. Be prepared for a long queue to check in.
50,Thoroughly enjoyed my stay here at the Mirage. One of my favorite locations on the strip. Central to everything and price is right. Beds are really comfortable and mini bar is stocked with all my favorites to include some good snacks. 24 hour eatery near the elevators make it a quick place to get breakfast or a late night meal.
40,Love the room! Bed was very comfortable layed there and fell right asleep! Bed was the favorite part of the room ! Over all everything was wonderful except the check in and the time wasted having to check in 3 to 6 hours plus expected.
30,Amenities were priced outrageous? $18 for a coke and $15 for water. Each room should have a personal refrigerator and microwave. The breakfast buffet was horrible $72 for buffet of an evening outrageous.
50,Great fun vacation! We had a blast. We would defintely go back! I really think after taking the survey you shouldn't require so many words the first couple of sentences would be sufficient. Consider changing that.
10,We just checked in our flight was delayed so they said our room catagory was no longer available. They offered us a handicap room or 2 queen beds with the view of a concrete roof. This room is subpar and neat not clean! No amenities in it. There is dust on lamps and on ice bucket...the more I write the angrier I get. I’ve stayed at a nicer room at the Golgen Nugget. No representatives seem to care just want you out of their face. Oh to boot our key card also didn’t work. 4 days of this will be torture! I’m beyond disgusted!  Thanks for nothing Mirage!
50,We always stay at The Mirage! It is convenient to everything and they have the best variety of games and restaurants anywhere! The staff is FABULOUS! They have a huge off track betting area and they also have some of the best entertainment around with Terry Fator and the Aces of Comedy!
10,"Went to Vegas for the first time and booked a room for the weekend at the Mirage. I hadn't heard anything good but I hadn't heard anything bad either so I gave them a shot. I booked via Allegiant because I was told it would be cheaper to bundle. Well it wasn't so if you go you might want to book separately. When I arrived to check in the check in/checkout was a disaster. The people at the front desk had no idea what the ""resort fees"" I was being charged were even for. Nor did anyone ever tell me. I figured booking a package deal via third party would have covered that kind of stuff but I guess not. Especially when someone is putting out 1000+ for the weekend. They also neglected to tell me that I had a 30 dollar comp/per day for food and drinks anywhere in the hotel. So I only got to use that one time.  I booked a 'Resort King' room expecting it to be a good room. The room itself wasn't too bad but the second I opened the window curtains and saw nothing but the roof of the lower part of the building that was kind of depressing. I don't know how anyone could call that a ""Resort King"" room.  Everything else was great in Vegas though. Hotel experience was garbage but the trip was pretty great."
20,I took my best friend to Las Vegas and chose the Mirage as it was rated as a 4 star hotel. It is not. Check in was long and our reservation could not be found. Our room had a ceiling leak a rip on the bed and overlooked a parking garage. For the same amount of money I could have gone across the street and stayed at the Venetian. Not happy.
40,Was not satisfied with the house keeping service. My sheets had spots on them and they weren't changed daily. There was black hair in bathroom when I checked in and there was in shower and on ceiling when I checked in.
30,The title of the resort shall be the “Waters” on account of the extremely high quality bottled water the provide in their rooms.. Apparently it is second to none with the high value it holds. Going forward I shall really think before I consume such a precious resource.
10,Stayed at the Mirage for a Convention. While at organized lunch left my sunglasses on the lunch table. After remembering once back at the convention I ran back to the room no more then 15 minutes later and they were gone. No one saw them and Concierge desk wanted nothing to do with my issue. Never asked my room number and provided very little assistance. They made 1 phone call and said oh they aren't found. Never took my name or room number. Disappointing.
50,Hi we arrived August 4 th 2019 and from the moment we walked in we felt welcomed this was our 7th visit to Vegas and our first stay at the mirage.  The front desk staff very pleasant and friendly. Special thanks go out to Andy for his assistance. Only negative issue was the check in and check out line is the same.  They should have half the large front desk divided into two one for check in and another part of the front desk for check out. If checkout is not busy then use it for check in.  We were given to rooms 24048 & 24050 great king strip view rooms. Rooms were very spacious and clean.  Can not say anything negative about our rooms our the cleaning staff.  Casino area was great no heavy smoke great ventilation. Clean and friendly dealers. Had no issues at the tables except for losing 😂.    Lobby bar was great nice place to have a drink again friendly staff great job bar tender James !    As for the restaurants  California pizza was great price average for a casino. Buffet cravings was great and worth the $$ average $20.00/ person. Great assortment.  Starbucks was great to get the paper and a coffee.  Only issue was Carnegie deli. Over priced limited portion for your $$$.    We booked the Oasis private pool for two days so so so happy we did. It’s cost 45$ per chair per day worth every penny. Location great quiet clean and great service thanks to the two hostess who worked extremely hard to serve and please the guests special thanks to Danielle our hostess the two days August 6&7  when we visited the oasis private pool.    After walking through the pool area you will see what I mean ! Never seen so many kids and the chairs packed in like sardines!    Nothing against kids just parents who can’t keep control of their kids ! Etiquette!    Did not try the Bare pool to good of a time at the oasis private pool.    Enough side when in Vegas try the mirage very clean accommodating and worth the $$$  Enjoy 😉!
50,Check in and check out were quick and efficient! The room was amazing and comfortable! ordered room service and the food was delicious and delivered on time and just like they said it would. The staff was super friendly!
50,Great place! Oasis pool could use a good cleaning though! Bed was so comfortable! Food was excellent! Try the bone marrow at Tony’s goes excellent with any steak!! otoros had great Oysters. Gaming was ok
40,Good as I have expected from past stays. 2 Queen room very roomy 2 chairs with work desk plenty of storage modern not beat up clean quiet black out curtains good AC no clock nightstand no coffee maker in the heart of the strip. Small casino but means less traffic in hotel for where you are staying. Very good summer rate $49 a night.
30,Mirage is in a great location. The casinos has a wide variety of games. They tend to be on the high limit side. Not to say they don't low limit slots and video poker. Great sports book. It has variety of restaurants but on the pricey side though. There are cheaper places to eat close by outside of the property. If you are on a budget. The rooms are nice but standard. But if you want to stay here you need to know the resort fees are outrages. I personally will not stay there again until they reduce the amount of the fee. But I will play there again.
10,We were staying at the Mirage to celebrate my wife and I’s 10 year anniversary! Our primary reason for staying at the Mirage was because we had tickets the the Beatles LOVE Show (the show was OUTSTANDING). Unfortunately for the $300 that the one night stay cost we experienced AWFUL hotel room conditions. It appeared from the moment we stepped in the room that whoever had previously stayed in the room had horrible B.O. or the room hadn’t been thoroughly cleaned or something. The staff was notified immediately they apologized said this happens all the time we will fix it. They brought a air freshener up did nothing. Again notified the staff the smell continues to get worse to the point after returned to the room after the show it was almost unbearable. Called again again nothing.... Really sad to have this experience when paying a lot of money for a room and celebrating such a special occasion. Let the front desk know as we checked out he acted like yup we deal with this all the time please just pay your bill now... really hindered our experience for our anniversary but we tried not to let it ruin the trip. Really wish the Mirage would’ve taken care if this i.e. (changed our room comped something offered assistance to fix the problem etc.)
50,The room was clean pool was large and spacious! We were able to leave our bags with the concierge while we explored the city. The hotel texted us when the room was ready and we had the room keys already and could go right up. The elevator service was also quick!
30,We stay at the Mirage when we visit Las Vegas. Usually every other year. Wonderful location and quick walk to strip. Rooms do need to be updated. Carpets look old and dirty. Very comfortable beds and great pillows. The buffet is not my favorite. Good food but poor cafeteria like atmosphere. All self serve even drinks. It's a lot to spend to feel like you are in a cafeteria. The casino drink service continues to be poor. Waitresses are few and far between. I have found this to be an issue everytime I gamble there. We spend most of our evenings across the street at Harrahs. I play the slots and a waitress comes by at least every half hour to ask if I want a drink. Find the slots a little looser there as well. Check in was fast and they let us check in at 1:30. Gentleman who checked us in told us it was a quiet week and they had many upgraded rooms available. When we asked if the upgrade could be complimentary he said he wished he could but he couldn't do that. Told him we have stayed at Mirage many many times but he wouldn't budge. That was disappointing. We are seriously considering staying at Harrahs on our next visit. The Mirage pool is very nice. Beautiful setting! Suggest you get there by 10 for a seat with some shade. Hop on the Deuce for Freemont Street. It's worth the trip.
40,Everything from check in to check out was great. Good sizes casino with plenty of table games and slots. The location was perfect right in the middle of the strip! Would stay again if visiting Las Vegas
20,The hotel was fine. However the valet damaged our car in 2 areas and refuses to take any responsibility for the damage. I would strongly avoid using this valet or any other SP valet service. Plus the valet is $24/night. Self park or don’t bring a car
50,the mirage is located near the center of the strip. a mall is next to it and a couple of top casinos. lots of good food options and large selection of slots and table games. nice pools and entertainment options. good choice for a vegas stay
40,Arrived for the WINN Show to buy fashion for my boutique. Sleeping comfort is great at The Mirage.. pool beautiful food great fabulous location When you walk through the front door you smell Pina Colada scents ! Not Smoke!! Great shows felt safe security professional and aware. Give it a try. Wonderful oasis in a Concrete jungle.
40,Overall the property is amazing. The bathroom need to be refreshed. We had a volcano view room on the 18th floor was great. Dining seems like more selection should be offered nothing quick to grab to go in the AM. Pool closes to early it's summer 7PM. Kids with their floaties should not be allowed in hot tub it's small. for our 25th Anniversary we were given a express pass for the buffet line. Think they should of done better than that seriously. Close to everything. It was a quiet week in Vegas which was fine for us since it was the week before school started. we enjoyed our stay.
50,Highly recommend this hotel!! The Mirage has a wonderful pool area and Great restaurant options!! And the secret garden habitat is super fun! Very clean hotel and our favorite choice for a summer getaway!
40,Compared to other Strip buffets this one is well priced and worth it. The salad bar was extensive and each of the entries we tried were tasty. The only disappointment were the desserts which were nothing special.    There is nothing new or exotic here just what a buffet should be.
40,My wife and I stayed 4 nights here at the Mirage in early August. We chose the property because of it's location and perceived value for the money. We arrived around 2:30pm. I was not expecting a room to be ready yet but decided to try and see. The MGM app let's you check in up to 24hrs before your arrival. This should let you check in quickly electronically at the hotel thereby skipping the line for traditional check ins. I did use the app the night before and checked in. An email is generated from the app telling you that when your room is ready a confirmation email will be sent with your room number included and a barcode to use at the electronic kiosk to obtain the room keys. Well 3pm came and went and still no email After 3:30pm I decided to wait in the huge lineup to manually check in. After almost an hour waiting in the line i finally spoke with a front desk attendant who gave me my room. I Still had not gotten the confirmation email. So needless to say that the check in process at the Mirage was not a good experience. I could see many people checking their phones like myself obviously looking for their code. What is the point of having this service if it is not supported by the hotel. It was working as i did see a precious few utilizing the kiosks but not many. After our trying ordeal at check in we were happy to get up to our room on the 24th floor for some relaxation. We chose the Tower upgraded King room located on the 24 and 25 floors. These rooms have an elevator dedicated to them so the wait times are usually not that bad. The room itself was nice with dual sinks a soaker tub and a walk in shower. The view was excellent as we were overlooking the pool and dolphin facilities and a southerly view of the strip. The only two hiccups with the room were: Our shower door did not seal tightly therefore a lot of water would escape. We had to roll up a couple of towels to coral the water. The other was that our safe was not functioning. We called down to the front desk and security was there within 20 minutes to reset it for us. The bed was comfortable but i found the pillows to be a little small. The property itself is nice. We enjoyed the reclusiveness of the general pool area. Plenty of palm trees and waterfalls to give one a sense of being on a Caribbean island. The casino was a little smokey but that is the nature of all of them in Vegas. I was significantly better then several others that we visited. I liked that the resort was not overly large as with a few others. It was easy to navigate around and find your way outside which can be a challenge in a few of them such as Ceaser's Palace. We ate in the Cravings buffet. They are charging for unlimited wine and beer now. It was good not great. The Wynn's is still the best that i have had in Vegas all be it it is more money. The parking was good at the Mirage although the tram going next door to Treasure Island was closed as well as the main fourth floor entrance to the resort. Pool drinks are quite good but also quite expensive. Overall i think that i would return to the Mirage. I would hope though that they can sort out their check in process and make that experience less painful for their guests
10,"Contacted hotel and received no immediate action. In fact the next day I had to contact the concierge twice to see if anything thing was going to happen. Waited for maintenance wasted a full day and they still did not show up. Went to the concierge and he actually asked me if I wanted a new room. Of course I did. Tried to compensate one days resort fees. I found that to be unacceptable. They said they couldn't compensate the room as I booked though booking.com. Always someone else's fault. Regret not calling the Las Vegas Fire Marshall.    Food and drink overpriced. Cannot ""disturb"" anything in the refrigerator or you will be charged for it. You can not use it to store leftovers or other items. No coffee or microwave provided."
40,We love the Mirage! Great location! Great pool! This has become our go to hotel in Vegas! You can't beat walking right outside and being near everything - easy to walk to other locations on the strip. The pool is wonderful - packed but fun and you can usually find chairs. The pool waitresses are great as well! I love the Mirage restaurants - especially The Pantry for breakfast. Highly recommend!
50,Beautiful hotel. The staff was friendly and the pool was incredible. Probably this is my favourite casino floor on the whole strip. The buffet at the hotel is not great but you are right next door to the bacchanal at Caesar's Palace so I wouldn't really consider that a problem.
20,"Stay at a cheaper ""resort"". At least there you will probably get what you pay for. At the Mirage you pay for the name but get nothing for it. Very disappointed after 6+ months of saving for a trip. The first room had a HUGE rip in the headboard. When I called to ask for a different room she said she could change us but couldnt guarantee the next one would be better. I said I would take that chance. We got the second room and she was right....it wasnt better. Instead of two huge rips there were finger nail holes all over the place. The wood is just old and looks like particle board. Finally I went down stairs and was offered to pay for an upgrade on the 12th floor. I paid it. I had always wanted to stay at the Mirage since I was old enough to go to Vegas and got the T-shirt. Not anymore. At this point I am embarassed to say I stayed there. The rooms were the same at the Excaliber when I stayed there back in the day. But then again I didnt expect much because I didnt pay much. I am glad we got a deal on this stay....although I will say that the Bellagio was just $40 bucks more. I will kick myself for a very long time for not taking this deal. Very very disappointed."
20,If the property just to refresh got better check in staff I would consider staying there again! The room smelled like smoke and is in bad need updating! I know the property Was built in 1986 but stillthe MGM Grand is old and does not smell like Cigarettes and regret! Bell and valet Staff are great along with Dave at the dolphin bar and Carlos at the pantry!
40,Staff was really nice resort was very nice location was pretty good. I only have complaints about two things. Our room would smell like cigarettes even when we are in the non smoking room. It would smell worse when the AC would cycle on. Second thing is the shower. The shower head has such great pressure that it feels like you're getting an acupuncture while you're taking a shower. The water would also take a long time for it to drain. Apart from these two things we for the most part enjoyed our stay at the mirage.
20,My 3rd visit to Vegas brought me to The Mirage. I had high expectacions but was disappointed.  The room was not properly clened: pubic hair on the toilet seat dust on the floor.. they fixed it within 2 days. The room was big enough but showed it's age.  Halfway through my stay I got a new room due to technical maintenance. That one was cleaner but had a nonworking AC. It produced an unbearable odour.    Given the fact that there are many better hotels in Vegas this one deserves only a rating of 2.
30,We stayed for 2 nights at the Mirage. The hotel is still nice although the check in/out line can be long and slow. Mirage is very central on the Las Vegas Strip so it’s a great place to stay and explore other neighboring hotels. There are a number of restaurants in the hotel. Skip the buffet because it’s gone down in quality. LVB Burger is pretty good. The pool was big and nice and has a desert theme. Overall decent stay for Vegas!
30,The location on the strip was really nice close to a lot. The pool was great and clean lots of chairs even when we came after opening. The rooms were just and average hotel room BUT they didn’t smell good- wet musty smell.
50,Oir stay at the Mirage was excellant! The food choices were good food was delicious the service was great clean rooms. We stayed on the Wellness floor and loved the aromatherapy. The pool was beautiful and entertainment was excellent too! Mirage is one of our favorites!
50,This is living!!! From the air quality to the cleanliness of the room and hallway. Superb! My family and I had the best hotel experience in Vegas so far. We slept so well and I never oversleep even if I went to bed late so this was quite a change and to wake up feeling refreshed and awake and energized is amazing!
40,Love the pool and location of Mirage. Exercise room has lots of equipment but could use more space for routines/ cardio. Lots of good restaurants on site. Easy to find your way around inside and kids don’t get lost.
40,Room was dated but comfortable and clean bed was very comfortable bathroom was big enough for two people and plenty of mirrors in roomcleaners did a good job of room every day we stayed on floor 7 had a good view of the strip all the staff we encountered were polite and helpful the pool was very nice but can be crowded at times the security in the hotel was good one slight negative is you can hear other people in there rooms fairly easily but did not bother us that much overall a good stay and would stay here again.
50,I will stay here again. I just hope they will rectify the situation that occurred they wouldn’t give me any choices on ways to fix the situation just said ok we will let you check out later Saturday and thought that would be ok
50,This hotel is exactly what you’d expect from a Vegas hotel. Gambling food and fun pool.    We had a stay well room on the 12th floor. They were well appointed and as a group having the adjoining room worked really well.    The view over the roof to the mountains was ok. Sound insulation from the corridor left a bit to be desired.    I would happily stay at the mirage again next time I’m in Vegas.
40,We enjoyed this trip the Hotel was very nice the rooms was nice the Front Desk got us a room right away on the 24th floor .  The Italian restaurant was nice and took care of my Request for my wife Birthday. Rocco the Server was excellent. The biggest complaint was the High Resort fees for very little service and the crazy Valet charge for YOUR HOTEL Guests imo if you are staying on the property you should not be charged. Also M life Pearl members should get Free Valet also
20,Wasn't given the room I reserved and the room I did get had plumbing problems with the shower backing up. While I did get a new room the front desk wasn't very accommodating. Lot of places to stay in Vegas try elsewhere.
30,Rooms are small bathrooms in room are extremely small. Overall rooms are some of the smallest on the strip. Couldn't get adjoining rooms even after requesting them on booking. When checking in we could only get rooms across the hall from each other and only on low floors. Terrible view from the 4th floor.
50,Loved the mirage! The tropical scent walking in was wonderful! Absolutely my favorite spot yet!! The staff was friendly very clean.... we had such a wonderful experience. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone!!
50,My stay at the Mirage was great! It all started when I checked in at the front desk the employee was so helpful and courteous. The room was great and the view was stunning! I loved eating at the Pantry anytime of the day. The casino was great as usual and the drink service was beyond excellent (thanks Tina!!!!)
50,Brought a bunch of people this time and everyone had a great time. The staff is incredible and upkeep of the mirage has been up to par. When going to the oasis pool the staff of Danielle Heather Ariel and Logan is top notch.
30,Nice place to stay good restaurant selection. However the hotel charges mandatory resort fee of $37/night. These fees are not immediately disclosed at check-in and cannot be removed. Disappointed with hidden fees.
50,We stay several times a year and it is always a great experience. We recommend the cabana experience it is comfortable and a great relaxing experience. The staff has always gone out of there way to provide a unique experience. The concierge has been the most amazing.
50,Had the chance to escape to Vegas for a couple of days to celebrate summer. Stayed at the Mirage which has become the go to resort. Great value for what you get. Mirage has a perfect spot on the strip and the suites are some of the best around. Can’t wait until next summer
40,everything is OK，just wish to improve the room remodel and get more benefit for the high roller players。And held more entertainment events in the future，invite more for come and held more games contest
50,Stayed at Mirage August 2019. Pool was great room clean bed comfy. Will stay there again. Only suggestion rooms need a upgrade and bigger bathrooms in standard rooms. Otherwise great hotel. Will stay there again!!!!
20,Have been staying at MGM properties for 20 years. I am jumping ship and staying with Caesars or Venetian. The tables have not paid for 3 years. The slots barely give you even money. The cocktail waitresses are MIA and when you do get a drink there is no booze. The dealers hardly speak English and have personalities like a stick in the mud. Walk across the street and you can actually win and get treated like they appreciate your business. Thumbs down Mirage...I am sorry to say this but it has only gotten worse year after year. No matter how many reviews I submit.
50,"Mirage has everything to offer - service excellence throughout the hotel.    I recommend for their beautiful and comfortable guest rooms; awesome pool ---- Heritage Steakhouse is a great place instead of trying to ""get in"" at some other ""trendy"" place...."
30,We were very excited to stay at The Mirage however were very disapointed by the quality of the room for the price we paid. The toilet constantly ran and the sink gurgled/dripped. The slat door out to the hallway also made for a very noisy room. We have had much better experiences at the lower cost hotels.
30,We spent 2 nights at the Mirage with our 3 children. While the hospitality suite was very spacious it was very dated. The furniture was run down there were problems with the faucets and damage to the bath tub not that we would have used it. The pictures on the website were not accurate.  Also we chose this hotel due to the large kid friendly pool. It was entirely too crowded to enjoy.  The staff and location were great and the volcano erupting was fun to watcy.
50,The Mirage was nice very friendly staff the rooms were nice housekeeping was fast and efficient the food was good the pool was clean the hotel is centrally located in the middle of the strip so its easy to get to anywhere on the strip - highly recommended.
40,We often cours the Mirage for our a Vegas vacation. It's in the perfect location and has a nice pool area. The rooms are comfortable. There are good options for dining within the facility but also places close by.
10,The management doesn't live up to its word. One of the most confusing check in situations I've ever had. Really odd things in the tower suite and the tub flooded my bathroom. Contacted hotel staff for all incidents and nothing came of it very dissapointed.
30,We expected to have better room service and a better view. The room didn’t have a fridge that we could even touch or microwave. The fridge only holds the mini bar and you are not aloud to even touch the things in it to create space for things you may want to put in it.
40,Good place to bring the kids for the dolphins and tigers. I would be come back again. The staff were friendly and easy to talk to. There's a lot to see and the pool was nice. Nice place to hang out with kids
30,Good for the price. I just didn’t like how there’s additional resort fee tax and parking. Otherwise everything was great. The room was beautiful and the location was great. MGM needs to stop charging people extra fees though.
50,The MGM properties are all amazing and The Mirage is no exception. Had an amazing time. The casino is well stocked with everything you might enjoy. The ambiance is quite stunning. The restaurants are amazing and staffed wonderfully.
30,Is this was my first day at the Mirage and my primary reason for staying there was because the Boyz II Men concert at the same hotel and it would just be convenient the rooms were a bit dated but overall a nice hotel and very clean
40,The hotel overall is great . it's at a perfect location it's also small so quick to walk in and out. pool is a good size and plenty of restaurants also the tables are plentiful. my only beef was with the people cleaning the rooms we were not requesting room service but on the 3rd day the mngr knocked and walked in on us and we were in the middle of getting dressed so I kicked her out very rude. That was the only negative
40,My wife and I celebrated our 20th anniversary in Las Vegas and stayed five nights at The Mirage. I registered for Mlife rewards before booking the hotel and received a good discount on the room and to the Beatles Love Cirque show(which by the way was wonderful!). I used the mobile app for check in and skipped the long check in line. Only needed to scan my phone and ID at a kiosk to print our room keys. I had issues with the first kiosk and was promptly helped by a staff member. We upgraded to the resort tower which allowed us to have a semi private elevator for two floors which was very convenient and worth the upgrade. The cleaning staff was very friendly and quick. Most of the wait staff in the casino were friendly we did have one night that I had to wave waitresses down to get a drink but overall was not that bad. We utilized the Avis car rental at the hotel for a very seamless experience getting a car for two days of excursions to Death Valley and Lake Havasu The only real complaint I have about our experience was that there are limited electrical outlets by the bed. I had to crawl under the bed/ nightstand to unplug lamps to allow usage of our CPAP machines. I found a few cob webs and dusty carpet there! Of course food and drink prices are ridiculous but that seems to be consistent on the strip. Overall we had a very enjoyable memorable trip!
40,I just completed a recent 3 night stay the Mirage Las Vegas I have considered it several times but never actually stayed there. I like the hotel/casino as it was very clean and in a great location but my biggest problem is becoming more noticeable at some of these mega resorts they do not have much or any selection of reasonably priced food. There are tons of nice restaurants and they charge top dollar for but I find it very difficult to pay top dollar for every meal every day. Hot Pastrami sandwich with a coke at Carneige deli was around $24 (nothing fancy) blue cheese bacon burger at LVB was $18 for an additional $8.95 you get fries and drink...burger was very good but for $18 it should have fries and drink with it and still a little steep. Good location to McDonalds across the street for $6.14 could get 2 breakfast sandwiches and large coke. Oh and watch out for resort fee ~$125 for 3 nights didn't use pool internet gym and doesn't include access to secret garden.
30,I chose The Mirage for a one night stay while some family was visiting from out of town. Prices at my preferred spots were skyrocketed due to a large convention so this was my first time on the North end of the strip. The location is great for spending a lot of time between Venetian Wynn Harrah’s and Caesars Palace. The Mirage itself however is very tired and dated.    My wife and I were in a Resort Tower room on the 24th floor with a panoramic strip view. The views were decent but rather obstructed by the amount of dirt on the windows. The curtains also did not close fully allowing for the strong lights from below to keep us up. The air conditioner rattled all night long and is aimed toward a wall making it difficult to cool down the entire room within a reasonable amount of time. The shower did not drain and the tub took close to an hour to fully empty. The worst part of our stay was the maintenance door right next to our room slamming at all hours of the night. The only positive part of the Resort Tower room was the elevator which only goes to the two floors these rooms occupy.    The casino is also nothing special. Plenty of table games and machines but the theme is lacking for such a classic Vegas Resort casino. The ventilation system needs extreme upgrades for it was just as smokey as Casino Royale across the street! The staff is give and take. A lot of rude dealers and pit bosses who take their time dealing with players cards.    Overall I would not stay or gamble here again. For the same price you can stay at Aria or Vdara and have a much better experience for what MGM Resorts has to offer.
50,We come to Las Vegas regularly and like to switch it up between resorts. We have been staying downtown and at Cosmo last few visits. It’s been a couple years since staying at the Mirage so our recent stay was a homecoming of sorts and the vibe was perfect. We are a young lower 60s and we don’t feel too old hanging with a very mixed crowd at the Mirage pool. If your looking for an upbeat fun pool vibe Mirage is your place. During the week it’s easy to get a chair and service is excellent. The crowd is a bit more on the mature side but not old foggy either. The rooms are awesome... clean and well appointed. Great choices of food and beverage all over the property and nearby and the perfect mid-strip location for venturing out to explore. All the staff we encountered... pool servers check-in staff and others were helpful and friendly. We forgot how great this place is and will be back soon enough. I even made some money in the sports book on a two game MLB parlay bet! Thanks Mirage.
30,The suite was very nice however it does need some upgrading. One of the front desk staff was extremely rude. However the rest were very nice. The bed was really comfortable. And the room was clean. Overall a nice hotel.
10,"I asked for a 2 double queen beds room for 4 people and confirmed before the arrival. But the hotel gave me a single king bed room???? They said ""Oversold and no room availsble.""  They provided a roller bed........"
40,I stayed at the Mirage as a competitor at the Fred Astaire World Ballroom Competition. I received a complimentary upgrade which my husband and I greatly enjoyed. The room was very comfortable and there are many amenities at the facility.    We would have rated it 5 star but we were disappointed that we could not even brew a morning cup of coffee in our room. We were not even allowed to use the room refrigerator to cool our own water or wine. In other words we were expected to pay extra for EVERYTHING in spite of a daily resort fee. I guess this is Las VEgas. Still it felt like nickel and diming when the place was expensive to begin with.    We attended the Cirque Beatles revue at the Mirage and truly enjoyed it. We also enjoyed the fire exhibit that took place at 8pm outside the main entrance.
40,easy to navigate the property some are to big to figure out where your at good plafce to stay and it smells good too . wish all the places were smoke free but its not the law yet i guess the sportsbook is smoke free but you still smell it
30,"Oasis pool was fantastic peaceful and quiet.  Lots of great food options.  Rooms have a musty moldy wet smell. we called and were given a new room.  it also smelled but not as bad so we figured this must be normal. Bed was comfortable. No bathmat when we checked in floor is very slippery.  No toiletires given after room was cleaned the second day..but we did get a bathmat!  Mobile check out is convenient especially with the huge line ups! no options for upgrades were given though like we had at other properties.  overall it was a very ""meh"" stay disappointing as the Mirage had always been on my bucket list to stay at."
40,The Mirage Hotel is almost center of all the big hotels on the strip. The rooms are clean and stocked. The price is fair for the services. We had a really nice stay. Also the food was really good at the hotel.
30,We came with our 4 adult children for 4 days to celebrate a few things. The Mirage hotel ended up being a bit nicer than we expected. (Our last Vegas stay was at Bellagio which set the bar high). Bed was comfortable linens and towels were good quality Room was well appointed and mostly clean. For us a big disappointment was no in room coffee/tea service. There are 2 places within the property to buy “coffee to go” but it’s a very long walk from the rooms to get to them plus they always had crazy long lines. A keurig would have been much more convenient. .....The pool area is nice but could use a good cleaning and sprucing up. We rented a cabana one day and while it was perfect to escape the 104 degree heat (loved the misters) it too could use a good power washing and new cushions. We were glad our cabana server was attentive and quick and while the drinks were good food was just average. Concierge was very helpful securing a dinner reservation at a particular property for us and it was very convenient to have a car rental desk right in the main lobby. The guys working the front entrance were always quick in hailing taxis for our large party. Sadly though on our arrival we did have a bad experience with a valet who mouthed off to my son when he started helping the valet unload our 8 pieces of luggage out of the van. The kids all gambled and won (we did not) so I believe they were satisfied with the gaming. All the bars served well made cocktails and the kids enjoyed the buffet breakfast (though beware there are some misleading statements made about “VIP” and “Skip the Line”). We enjoyed the dolphins and tigers though way too expensive. Overall this hotel could use an update. We were charmed by the polynesian theme (especially the lobby which is good for pics) but it gives off a loud “outdated” vibe. Either update the hotel to justify the high prices or lower the prices to match the “moderate” level feel.
20,...at least I should suppose it’s that way.    It’s Our second visit in a week and both rimes the rooms faced the very bland rooftop of the casino. Our room was freshly made but the actual cleanliness of the carpet and various surfaces was debatable.    We thought we’d learned a lesson checking in the very long wait the first time so when we returned we used the app and mobile check-in. Certainly seemed like a great strategy since there were 70-80 people on the line. But alas the QR code was having technical difficulties and we resorted to jumping on the rewards line to get help- since no one was at the automated machines to troubleshoot. Frustrating. Especially since the desk seemed fully aware that it wouldn’t work.    Please use this review as evidence that we the consumers are observant. That we want our entry to your lodging to be gentle efficient and clean. But we noticed that even your front entrance veranda is messy certainly not being tended by the half a dozen or more entrance employees none which came over to assist with our trunk full of luggage.    I expect this at a Best Western where self serve is understood. But the room atmosphere-appearance and check-in was better in that hotel near the National Park than in one of the hotels slated as a gem on the strip.
10,Boo never ever again. This place was a mess. Room was dirty. There was a leak in the ceiling. The staff told me they could change rooms because the hotel was full. Never ever stay at this hotel or you’ll regret it!
20,Concierge was rude. Check in staff lied about an upgrade. Room was a basic motel looking room and smelled like cigarette smoke! Sink in bathroom was backed up. Mirage is not worth the price! If you're going to splurge stay at the Aria or Treasure Island.
40,Always stay here clean friendly and good all round hotel that is good value for money.  Would recommend that you ask for a room in the North wing as that has the best view down the strip.  The pool area is clean with loads of seating and a reasonably priced restaurant.  Plan to visit again next year.
50,First - What happened in Vegas stay in Vegas but I will share few tips for you :    Mirage Hotel - Brilliant very good customer service - I believe almost all hotels on the strip provide same service :) so if you would like to go stay on the strip choose one of this hotels . I choose Mirage because I am fan of Ocean' s Eleven    Tips:    Don't use grocery shops in hotel - when you use Starbucks strip exit and cross street turn left and you have 24H shop - all items are half price :)    Breakfast prices - it will cost you around $46 for 2 people but you can save money if you order subway by uber eats    Gambling - tip waitress $1 or $2 so you have a lots of free drinks also dont forget register for Mlife card - for example they took $200 from my hotel bill in last day :)    Taxis - Use Uber - cheaper and easy - you will save a lot of Money almost $12 dollars for trip to any destination    Swimming Pool Area - Nice and cool but it is not WOW - but understand this as you don't go Vegas to use pool lol    Things to do :    Grand Canyon - rent car and go  we choose skywalk trip only 2.5 hours drive and it is amazing have to say    Hoover dam - on the way and you should see but dont forget to see Boulder City - 1 of 2 cities which gambling is prohibited and when you go to Museum (Free entry) you can discover a lot of things    Fremont street experience : nice spot to see in the night :) go to west area to see old casinos El Cortez - 75 year old and outside looks same as before :) You can feel old smell in this Casino -if you know what I mean :). I did not use zip line because I could not go with Gopro and I did do it before    See other hotels :    Venetian  New York New York Excalibur etc .... Amazing experience    Shows - I have seen Micheal Jackson in Mandalay Bay Hotel by Cirque del Soil and was absolutely amazing - worth any money    Boys II Man - I was lucky to see concert - Still Top Class Band - Almost 2 hours of fun and Quality Music - I won't say more :)    Bellagio Fountain show - went twice Amazing experience    Volcano at Mirage - Nice but not as good as Bellagio :)    I would not recommend go Vegas with Kids it is Adult place (go to Orlando instead)- you can smoke and drink anywhere also almost naked people on the streets I think kids are not ready to see this    I hope it will help you and I will recommend to go Vegas - it is amazing experience    Almost forget about roulette .... If you from Europe - they have only one table with one zero and it is $50 minimum bet so be aware of this. They have similar tables with 0 00 Mirage which I played and almost all the rest looks like paddy power roulette    Enjoy your trip
50,We stayed at the Mirage during the first week of August for our wedding and it was wonderful! The staff was helpful and great to work with! Neil in group sales was awesome and so helpful in reserving our wedding block and making reservations for our party. We stayed in a resort tower king room and it was very comfortable and well appointed.
40,The check-in process was terrible. Line was ridiculous after traveling from NY the last thing I wanted to do was wait in line for behind 50 people. Hotel itself was nice rooms were clean and location was great! If you touch anything when you open the mini-bar in your room you will be charged so be careful! The warning should be on the outside of the fridge not inside! I had to wait in line (again) to get the charges removed. Pool was nice.
40,The temperature (40 degrees c most days) and the location on the Strip are both hot. On its own I would easily give the Mirage 5 stars for facilities location and service but when compared to the Venetian (opposite) and Caesar’s (next door) it doesn’t quite measure up its older than the other two and hasn’t got the attached (spectacular) shopping malls that both it’s neighbours have. That being said we had a fantastic time and the location is brilliant being almost central on the Strip. If you go don’t miss the free evening volcano show.
50,Something to brag to our friends that this 4.5 star hotel is meticulously clean friendly and courteous staff that's help us throughout our stay the hotel amenities was absolutely awesome friendly staff and did I tell my room was facing Las Vegas Strip facing the amazing Volcano Attraction It's beautiful scenery.
50,Beautiful hotel lush tropical enviroment. We stayed in a tower suite that was beautiful. My only complaints is no in room coffe pot and no smoking suites as in other MGM properties. Of course I could have had room service deliver my coffee but as a smoker I want a cigarette with my coffee
50,Mirage has the best associates throughout the hotel. Shawnee in reservations on the phone helped us take advantage of a offer that I had missed the rooms were kept very clean and well stocked with towels toilet paper etc. Just walking in the hallways the cleaning staff and maintenance personnel were very friendly and helpful. Carnegie deli and the pantry also has friendly employees along with great food. The mlife desk ladies were also very friendly and helpful. The Beatle show is always great. The ladies asking for drink orders were great also very friendly and fast. We stay at Mirage every year the reason is they have the best associates who are excellent in customer service.
50,Vacation time!!! Very nice like always friendly and very centric. Buffet excellent good food and beer for a cheap price at the buffet. I’m going back in November again with my wife for vacations. To enjoy!!!
10,We checked into our room and there was vomit stains on the floors next to the bed vomit on the walls and curtains. My husband sliced his finger on broken glass that was on the bed then looked down to find broken glass on the floor as well. moved us to a new room and it was just filthy and dusty everywhere! We will never stay or recommend this hotel to anyone! Too many other issues to list!
30,Rugs in room filthy. Had a smell upon walking in and we found this machine plugged in and it was an odor eliminater! They forgot to remove it! Room did not have a wow factor. Requested two extra pillows that night but I didn't get them until next day.
10,After staying at the Mirage for the past 10 years we won’t be back...hotel is showing serious wear and tear. Too bad because we love the location!!!  Good food selection and pool is still nice but rooms are dirty and the slot machines in the casino are also showing a bit of wear and tear.
50,I love the closeness of everything within this hotel. Everything you need or want is within steps vs the seemingly endless treks in other hotels for just a cup of coffee! Love this pool as well - many spots to be had for in and out of the sun.
50,A quick over night. A great stay. Clean room good breakfast at the pantry in am. Valet services and check in folks were excellent. Won a few dollars at the tables and had a nice cocktail and cigar to cap off my visit. Thanks for a wonderful night.
40,Amazing hotel although extremely expensive but so is everywhere in Vegas. Lovely pool with very attentive waitresses. Good choice of restaurants to choice from. Volcano display outside was fantastic to see. Very enjoyable stay and great casino for a first timer!
50,Mid strip location is great! Casino is clean staff was fantastic! Food at cravings was great atmosphere is underwhelming but since we had mlife rewards it was acceptable. Pool was great large enough to accommodate without having to be on top of people. (Didn’t go to bare)
50,I really enjoyed this casino especially the crap and roulette table.Lol.I won a nice sum of money.The dealers were courteous and entertaining.Drinks were served in a timely manner.There wasn’t anything I saw that would keep me from going back.
50,I would recommend this hotel to Family and friend. It’s near the middle of the strip across from restaurants and Walgreens. Hotel is very clean and staff is very friendly. Starbucks inside which was a plus!
50,We took a famiy vacation. It was a very nice hotel with multiple food choices. The staff was really nice at tgr front desk and MLife desk. Located in great area. My kids love the volcano show. Would stay here again.
40,It’s a semi cheaper but worthy hotel on the strip to the other more high end hotels. Always have deals to help you save more money. Perfect for a BAE-cation or family vacation. I wouldn’t come here for business trips their WiFi isn’t the best but they do have a desk in the room.
20,While staying at The Mirage we rented two lounge chairs at the 21+ private oasis pool at $45 per chair. We assume this was a good deal as the area would be nice and it included infused water mocktails and and fruit tasting throughout he day. The space was comfortable but the only offering was ice water none of the claimed included mocktails or fruit or infused water were offered (false advertising). The pools edge needs also needs a good scrubbing as there is a brown scum all the way around on the pool tiles where the water meets the surface we also encountered the occasional smell of sewer. We were very disappointed and left the area by 2pm
50,One of the best Casino Hotels on the strip great staff and does not feel dirty or old like some other casino/hotels on the strip. Traveled with kids and they loved the pool. Been here several times and will be back.
50,From check in to check out everything was smooth . Willie was my point of contact and he does his job so well I’m not sure it can be considered a “job”. Trip was fun trip was memorable they exceeded my expectations!
40,We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Mirage. The facility is well maintained and the staff was uniformly excellent. We only ate at the buffet for breakfast (other meals at other hotels) but the food was well-prepared with multiple selections.    While we received an outstanding room rate (that came with the breakfast buffet) a $37/night (plus tax) resort fee seems high. Additionally the front desk process is extremely slow with either too much information required from guests or an inadequate number of staff.    All that being said we do recommend the Mirage. It is very well located and the level of service outstanding. While the Mirage and other hotels will not likely change their resort fee policy (too much of a moneymaker) if they can improve the front desk experience there is nothing but praise for the hotel.
40,We Have stayed at the Mirage a couple of times and always enjoy our stay there. The staff is friendly and check in and out was quick. There are a few restaurants that cover a wide variety of food and drinks on the property. Really enjoyed the pool there one thing nice about the pool is we could find shade around the pool area to get out of the sun and just enjoy the outdoors. The room was clean and pretty quiet bed was comfortable. Good shower pressure and towels were soft.
40,We spent three nights at The Mirage over the weekend. We had a great time and of all the resorts we walked through I think the Mirage was my favorite. The hotel over all is smaller than most of the others which we loved because it felt less overwhelming. It was very easy to find everything and the layout made sense.    We were upgraded to a Stay Well room. The room was huge and the amenities in the room were well worth it. The air purifier and aromatherapy were nice add ons. The mattress was really uncomfortable though. It was very hard. The room over all was very clean. The walls are really thin though. Walking down the hall we could hear what was going on in other rooms. We heard the people next door talking. We heard kids crying or running down the halls.    The only reason I can't give a full five stars is the restaurant service was terrible. We ate a very late dinner at Pantry where it was really slow. It took forever for us to be waited on the waiter brought us half our drinks and no straws and then disappeared. Another waiter corrected the issue but it still took way too long for a restaurant full of staff with only 3 other tables seated. The food was really expensive portions are small and it was just OK. We ate at much better places during our trip.
50,stayed For 4 nights..... amazing vacay! Loved the room the location on the strip is perfect and the pool is the best!! (Shout out to Matt and Dave at the dolphin bar for great service) Food and drink was expensive but excellent. Enjoyed every part of this stay We weren’t disappointed at all and will return for sure!!
40,"We enjoyed the stay.attention and service was great.Food is pricey but very good.Pantry for breakfast is recommended but expect to pay.""Cravings"" buffet is very good.Pool is ok. There is no deep end. Pool isnt recommended for laps just to chill and drink and sunbathers. Kids did enjoy it but they got bored after a couple of hours. Heard Mandalay bay pool is better. Also the pool closes early at 7 bummer. The Beatles ""Love"" show by circu de Soleil is a MUST. If you stay at Mirage you can get a discount on tix. Ask to sit on se tion 201 in the back. We got the best seats in the house for the best price. Other people bought their tix up close and ould appreciate a lot of the acts. The Tiger and Dolphin exhibit is available but you have to pay a hefty price.    We did enjoy our stay but we will try either Paris New York or Mandalay Bay next time."
50,We stay at the Mirage each summer......and look forward to the welcoming smell of the lobby the flowers the huge fish tank and the waterfall. We have always had a good room usually with a view of the Strip. This year our room overlooked the volcano which was really cool.  We love the pool and especially the Dolphin Bar. Cozy good drinks and another piece we look forward to each year.  There are plenty of hotels in vegas to stay but The Mirage is reasonably priced rooms are big clean and comfy (and usually quiet!!) and has GREAT restaurants.
20,We booked a strip view and when we checked in they said they did not have any strip views. We were then promised volcano view and when we arrived to the room it was rooftop view. I called and the front desk said that they were going to call me the next day for a change of room. That never happened. The lock for the bathroom did not work and the air conditioner did not flow well so the room was muggy and hot during the day.
10,After arriving at checkin we are told they need another $400. This was a complete travel package airfare and hotel paid. Supposedly. $200 was a resort fee and then another $200 for incidentals supposedly but they were giving us a free $50 credit for dining. Lmao. That didn't even cover 2 drinks at the pool!!! So at electronic check out it showed we owed $275 but was going to contest that when we got home. Couldn't stand in line for 2 more hrs and miss our flight home standing in check out line. . Now when I login to my chase card app I've been charged over $300. So now I filed a fraud claim with chase.    Also bathroom has mold!!! Why a high end hotel let's this happen is beyond me. See pic.    On a side not the room cleaning staff was always really nice and helpful.    Save your money and stay downtown. Golden Nugget or El Cortez. They have way better machines drinks and food!!
30,I must say that every staff member we encountered at the Mirage were hotel was absolutely amazing. Very friendly smiling asking if we’re having a good time. Everyone seemed genuine and not funny at all. I was quite impressed. However the AC in our room never worked properly we complained about it over six times. They sent an engineer to try to fix it but it never got cool enough and we would wake up during the night sweating.  Food was. Dry goos and The casino never really smelled that bad of cigarette smoke. However I do wish they had a non-smoking section out by the swimming pool .  I love to work out every day and their gym equipment was in need of replacement a little too outdated
30,Basic double queen room decent size.  First room we had on floor 15 ended up having a major leak in the ceiling that made it rain in the bathroom.  We were given another room & resort fees waived. No apology. No upgrade for the inconvenience.  Pool was great. Actually a bit cold but it was cloudy. I’m sure on a sunny 100+ day it’s refreshing as could be.  Property is pretty dated. The shopping area is small not a large choice of restaurants (Venetian across street has huge food court) and just kind of a disappointing lack of things.  I don’t think I’ll stay here again. There are better options in the same price range
50,Our room was very cleanwith beautiful views of the volcano.truly wondering staffand very helpful.Highly recommended.Great amenitieswonderful restaurants selection.Love the white tigersand lion exhibits.Can't wait for our next trip!
50,Great food fun and attitude. You will be treated like family at this resort! The pool was super the drinks were tasty and no problems finding food the selections are just plain great. I wish I could of stayed 3 more days!!!!
20,My husband and I just celebrated our NINE year anniversary at The Mirage. We got married there nine years ago and this was our first trip back to Vegas since then! And in that nine years we have had three children. And believe me it’s no easy feat to find someone to watch three young children!  Upon checking in at check-in time no less (not early!) we made sure to mention all of the above information.  We were told the room we booked was all they had available. We were not given any complimentary drinks discounts or offers. Okay totally fine! That’s not why we came back but surprising no less.  Then on the way up to our room in the elevator we overhear two couples talking about their own check-in experiences. One was a couple that was offered free drinks and a free buffet because they were celebrating a birthday. The other couple said that they went and complained about their room and were instantly upgraded to a better room on a higher level.  We are VERY disappointed in the service/hospitality we received at The Mirage. There are SO MANY options when visiting Las Vegas and although we would recommend The Mirage for their location after this stay we have no other reason to recommend them as a hotel/resort.  Spend your money elsewhere somewhere that is thankful to have repeat guests guests who could have chosen more cost efficient options but chose your hotel because of the memories they have there and a hope that you would help them celebrate. Unfortunately The Mirage did none of those things.
50,Very relaxing excellent service. Comfortable beds. The pool was wonderful. Swimming pool very clean and service by the pool was great. I am a mlife member. Wonderful benefits. Highly recommended to get the mlife card.
50,My friend and I made a quick trip to Vegas for a concert. We missed the concert but chose the right hotel for our overnight stay. The casino was nice and clean not overly smoky. We enjoyed some burgers in the bar before we hit the strip. Although the room was a little snug the beds were very comfortable. It would be on my list of hotels to stay at.
50,I had a great time at your resort! Everyone was very friendly. The resort was clean and the staff made sure to go above and beyond. I would recommend this resort to anyone who was looking for a great resort right on the strip!!
30,Mirage has always been a favorite of mine and I've stayed there many times. Very disappointed in the room service...more like food in a bag service...just has a cheap feel to me. I prefer my food on a plate and my coffee in a pot...not a cardboard box. What a let down. More like a cheap motel experience.
50,I am not a gambler so my comments only pertain to the hotel experience itself. This is a nice property with clean and comfortable beds friendly staff and attractive scenery. I found the location easy to navigate and the food was very good.
40,I have been to the Mirage 4 times. They have a great pool. Not too busy not too noisy not a party pool. Just a huge nice pool to relax beside. The rooms are small to average and the bathroom is small (you almost have to straddle the toilet to close the door). No service issues and nothing wrong with the rooms. Clearly I have been back multiple times. Rooms average but the hotel is mid strip a good location and I like the pool.
30,This was our first visit to Las Vegas and we were left a little disappointed by the Mirage. We checked in online so didn't really have an experience with the staff. Once we got to our room the headboard was ripped there was a jumper left on the back of the chair there was a cigarette butt left on the floor there was trash in the drawer next to the bed and the toiletries hadn't been replaced - at least the bed was made.    The casino was great it was my first time playing Blackjack in a casino and the croupier was great at helping me learn.    Checkout was easy as well as we just did that via the app and left.
30,"It began when we did a mobile check-in while at the Airport. I understand we arrived earlier than designated check in time at the 3:00pm so to wait was understandable at first because we arrived an hour and 1/2 earlier. We are travelling with our friends and we all arrived at the same time however they immediately got their room. We went to there room for a little while and left our bags there and went to eat.  We get back and still no text for our room even after 3. Although we did a mobile check in we also talked to Kyle upon arriving and Kyle told called someone and got off the phone and said ok guys I switched you room because the first room you were getting the people have a late check out. Ok I even accepted that. Well after we never received a text and finding food to eat we called the front desk to from our friend's room to ask about our room. I talked to Traylan. Traylon is very rude and not considerate of our inconvenience of not having our room even after 3pm. Her exact words well our policy is this is first come first serve abd you may possibly have to wait until 7pm to get in your room. No where on the website or any other material makes mention of this ""policy."" I explained to her Kyle said all we needed was our room number since we already have the key but he knows what room we have but he can't say yet because we first have to get a text. So yes basically we received a key because we would soon get our texr to go the room because mind you Kyoe switched our rooms because of the supposed other guest late check out. I told Traylan all of this and she didnt come right out and say I don't care what he said but she said regrettably you still have to wait and we do everything on first come first serve. Not true! And regrettably you will receive no comps even after I asked for one due to the inconvenience. We ended the phone call but I then called back to speak to another front desk rep who was very considerate in apologizing but still said basically she could not do anything. At this time I asked to speak to the manager. I can't remember her name but wish I could because I sure would name drop. I  explained to her what happened and was put on a long hold and then finally she came back to the phone and said we found you a room.  Your room is....but wait you guys found the room that we had been assigned by Kyle but he couldn't tell us a room number earlier because we had to get a text and it was policy to wait on the text? This is a joke. Only a few apologies from the one attendant and no body else.  No comps no upgrades no free nothing no discounts only an oh we found a room for you after waiting until after 3 pm the assigned hotel check in time. Another room should have been ready in the first place or Kyle should have been honest. Don't tell me you found me another room and its almost ready. Remember Kyle said he changed our room because of the the previous guest. Oh and don't move anything in the fridge or snacks from the counter because you will be charged. They are monitored by a sensor. Kyle didn't tell us upon actual check in but our friends did.  Maybe my friends should be hired for customer service. mini-bar removed - just touched.  There are only 2 electric sockets near the bed - one on each side but the lamps and clock are plugged in there. I had to charge my phone across the rom.  The iron and ironing board are ancient and were worthless. The iron doesnt even work. I will never stay here again. Not to mention my friends had to clean the headboard due to nasty streaks. They will be doing a review also ..not going to steal their thunder. This same review is about to be emailed to the hotel."
30,Stayed in a double queen room. The bathroom door was broken usb outlet didn't work and safe was broken. Front desk agent was very rude so finally I asked(twice after being put on a long hold) to speak to the manager who comped my resort/ extra person fees. Yay. Pool is awesome.
50,"I attended the WNBA Allstar Game in late July. Spent a week in a stay well room. No problems with the room air conditioning kept the room at 67 even with temps over 100. I decided to try the ""VIP"" offer as it was $100 for the full stay when I booked otherwise $50 a day. This provides a lounge for check in and out. As I arrived after 7 pm on a Wednesday it was closed. This lounge offers ""free"" coffee soda water wine selection of beer no snacks. You can use the service to make reservations for golf shows restaurants. Airline checkin and printing of boarding passes is included. It should include skip the line for early entry into the swimming pool. I was in 12003 which overlooked the dome over the lobby. I could see the flames of the ""volcano"" over and through the dome. I assume that because of the ""VIP"" status the room was close to floor lobby. While I did take advantage of the drinks and boarding pass printing this for me was not worth $100. Had Eggs Benny at the Pantry excellent. I used comps from My Vegas for buffets. The slots ate money really fast. When staying at the Mirage I book the Private Oasis the first day as 1 side has shade and with umbrellas I avoid the direct sunlight. Service is very attentive. There were loungers available at the pool throughout the day although ""saving"" should be banned. Lots of families stay here as the pool has shallow areas good for kids. There was a convention with over 10k attendees public spaces were overcrowded in the mornings at lunch and when the days events were done. Overall it was an excellent stay"
40,The staff were very friendly and the concierge was lovely helping us organise a show. The room was comfortable with everything we needed make sure to ask for a room with a view. The volcano show out the front is also great. There are no very good restaurants in the hotel witch let it down they are over priced for no reason I would walk next door to ceasers for better options. The hotel did feel a bit worn and dated.
40,Good hotel not great. Although there are features of this hotel that are outstanding the majority of the hotel could do with a renovation.    Still though one of the better properties on the strip. Large pool area could do with a better layout though in terms of sunbeds etc. It felt a bit of a mess.
40,Loved watching Boys to Men perform at the Terry Fator Theater at the Mirage Saturday night. My hands were full from the concession stand and I was struggling. An usher helped with my items and escorted me to my seat without hesitation. The casino is opulent beautiful huge fish tank a fun environment. I’ve seen the Dolphin habitat before and it’s always a good time. Great memories.
10,Hotel is old and dated. Pillows are so flat took 3 too make 1 pillow. A/C didn't work we called to Service  2 out of the 4days we were there. Not a good night rest room to warm. With all of choices in Las Vegas I would not refer the Mirage.
40,"I really like this property. The only reason for the ""3"" for service was our first bad restaurant service experience. Love the bartenders at both the lobby bar and the center bar. We have stayed here before and I would definitely return"
20,The staff was very rude. For the money we spent we’d expect much better. Guest services was very rude and we our check in was much later than we were advised. The representative had an attitude when we called to beck on our room. We had a strict itinerary and lost out on our reservations and money due to this.
50,Clean and comfortable very large room early and late check in and out is available. . Missing is a refrigerator in room which would be nice for leftovers. Don’t ever touch a thing in the room minibar fridge or snacks on desk or you’ll be charged
40,Rooms too expensive. The pantry restaurant way too expensive. The buffet was great value and delicious. convenience of checking was perfect. Bell hop was great and secure. We had a delightful stay.. a bit expensive
50,The mobile check in was very convenient and save us hours from waiting in line. Self parking was easy and the rooms were excellent in cleanliness. Their was security in all locations of the hotel and casino so it felt safe and under control. If we had a question staff was beyond helpful and my overall all experience was beyond exceptional.
20,Overall good stay. Was under the impression as fees were paid upfront all fees were taken cared off. Was not told on Priceline page resort fees would apply once we arrived at resort. For a business trip were over 200 business partners stayed was expecting a flat rate price. The housekeeping staff did not make the beds instead dropped off the bed covers in plastic transparent bags but did not make them. Other than that the stay was pleasant and comfortable
50,We have stayed at the Mirage about 4 times in a row. It is clean in a good location with great food great staff a great pool area. They do not bicker with you about taking your Starbucks to the pool area (as other hotels some times do) the buffet will even let you take your drink out after dining...a nice convenient perk. The Mirage is our place to go when we do Vegas....
50,I stayed at this hotel for business. The experience was amazing and I would definitely stay there again in the future. It was a bit pricey but well worth it. The housekeeping for the floor I stayed on (24) did an exceptional job and was tremendously friende leda
10,I’m writing this review while I’m still here I cannot think I payed €600 for this motel room very old like 70s room bad smell poor tv one of the worst hotel in Las Vegas ...please see the photo also there was a problem with the dusk
40,A group of friends wanted to join us to help me celebrate my birthday. We all flew in from San Diego for a couple of nights to see a couple of shows and spend a few bucks at the tables. We all left with smiles and a several returned with a few extra bucks in our pockets.
10,Not only were the machines never paying out but there was not a server to be found. Even asking a pit boss about sending a server over we never did see any waitresses.  It was unfortunate. We left feeling disappointed and went to another casino to spend our money.
30,Check-in was a nightmare (about 1.5 hours) and bathroom shower was rusty leaked and needed fixing. Other than that I really did enjoy my stay here and would probably come back. Loved the lobby area and the buffet was a great deal.
30,I enjoyed the Casino. My wife liked the slots. I pretty much had to work during the week. However the bed was too low. I think smoking on the floor is a problem because it gets into the the clothes of non-smokers. Nice garden nice flowers and a very attractive place. Good restaurants and we did have a nice time.
50,Love this hotel. The service is superb. The casino area is not smoke filled at all. Very spacious gaming area. We loved the hotel room also. Very nice decor. Well thought out lay out. Very clean and amenities were very nice.
40,Amazing place. Very close to Ceasrs and T.I. The room was clean comfortable quiet. Pool was outstanding and not too busy on a really hot day. The dolphin exhibit was fun and not overly crowded. An overall fun relaxing stay in Vegas.
50,We had a room on the 18th floor with an excellent view of the strip and pool. Like all Vegas hotels it will take you a few days to get your bearings as they are so big. The Mirage is actually smaller than many of the strip hotels which we liked. The room was clean and comfy with a safe iron ironing board and hair dryer provided. There is also a mini bar and snacks in the room however your would be crazy to even touch these. Just pick them up and you will be charged.    The casino at the Mirage is smaller and less intimidating than many of the other casinos and the atmosphere is very friendly and welcoming. We ate in the Carnegie Deli The Pantry Cravings and LVB Burgers and Bar all in the Mirage. The food was very good with the exception of the buffet. The food in the hotel is expensive. Two burgers one fries a coke and a milkshake will set yo back $80.    The pool area of the hotel is lovely. Its big with plenty of sunbeds. People do queue for it to open so they can get the best beds. They tend to put towels down and then go and get something to eat. However the staff are very active in moving the towels if the beds have not been used for some time. There are no umbrellas unless you want to pay $$$$$ for a day bed.    Lastly the Volcano is also an attraction not to be missed. It does throw out some heat if you are at the front but well worth visiting. I would stay in the Mirage again its a well maintained hotel that is not too big like many of the others. The staff were great.
40,Great location and beautiful hotel. Quick check-in and complimentary upgrade to Tower King Room. Pool was beautiful but finding chairs in the shade can be hard unless you get out there very early and stand in line.    EVERYTHING (food drinks souvenirs) at the resort is incredibly overpriced. It used to be that Las Vegas was known for a fairly inexpensive vacation destination but I don't know how 'normal' people afford to go there anymore. I loved the vacation but I don't think we'll stay on the strip next time. We might walk around there to see the sights but stay elsewhere to save money.
50,Wonderful birthday trip! The rooms were very nice always cleaned perfect everyday! The restaurants were great and the pool was awesome! Great casino games with good payouts! I recommend it highly!!
50,It was one of the best weekends we have had in a long time. I have to give a lot of credit to the Mirage and their service and atmosphere. WE will be coming back again and will be booking at this hotel.
50,Second time staying this year. They have great staff and a solid gaming and sports book floor. Looking forward to coming back! - our concierge/bellman was overly helpful. He got us a cooler for our beverages. Our room upgrade was handled well by Alex. I really like the cozy atmosphere of the whole floor and great location!
50,the staff was very very friendly and an genuinely helpful  at all times. beds were very comfortable great nights sleep.  location on the strip is great. the meals at STK were excellent  i suggest the rib eye.
30,So we just stayed for 6 days for my sons 21st birthday . We stayed here because my son and his girlfriend have never been before and we figured it was centrally located . We haven't stayed here in a few years ourselves. We have stayed at the palazzo and Aria that last few years. We had a group of 10 people and a lot of luggage not a single bellman came to help us . They actually looked at us and ignored us . They would have got tipped off of three rooms. Their loss . The check in line was one of the worst I've seen . It was slow moving with not all the desks manned. If it's that busy it should be fully staffed . Only two of the three rooms were ready at 2:30. So because no bellman took our bags we stored our luggage in one of the other rooms till ours was ready . We went to lunch and it was close to 4:00 when we got text our room was ready . We used the mobile kiosk because the line was still to long had trouble with the kiosk scanning my drivers liscense so I was getting pretty annoyed now. And no one was attending the kiosk even though there is a desk for help. The rooms are a nice size  we never felt cramped . The bathroom is on the smaller side though . We enjoyed the pool all week it is one of the nicest in Vegas . Since we last stayed there they put in a new pool bar which was nice . Pool opens at 8am so if your in line by 7:45 you can get your pick of seats. If you wait till later you will find a seat just rows back from pool edge . We enjoyed the bar by the sports book. The bartenders are very good and it was a fun place to play the machines. I never found the casino smelled of smoke that bad . I would consider staying again. Oh and my husband was disappoint all week the war table was never open . Lol he loves that game and the casino was super busy so why not open it ?
20,The common areas are nice the rooms are tired and they need to be updated. Bathtub was rusting the sink damaged and the carpet dirty Restaurants were good casino clean ride share easy to access..Don't expect much and you will be fine.
50,I have stayed there before and I will stay there again very clean and great god and atmosphere. Although the sinks in the bathroom were dirty. We will consider staying there again in the future. Great hospitality
40,Business Trip to show at the International Furniture Market.at the convention center.The Company I represent Jofran has permanent show space of about 18000 sq.ft. We show twice a year once in January and once in July.
50,The Mirage has the best pool on the strip plenty of seating and the bar served fantastic drinks...we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Mirage. The rooms were nice the buffet was awesome. We will be staying here again.
20,Would not recommend this hotel to anyone. It was our first trip and I was blown away at how UNfriendly the dealers were concierges and overall staff. Extremely overpriced... food was not good. Ruined my first trip to Vegas.
10,The first time we stayed at this hotel in 2008 I thought it was the most beautiful hotel in Las Vegas. Visiting last month and it was disgusting dirty and in need of freshening up. Furthermore the staff was unprofessional rude and tacky. We were there all of two nights. Let me start with the valet attendant yelling at me to remember where I parked my car. I was in a rush in the morning to get my daughter to where she needed to be and asked for my car the lady said I was at the wrong valet. How would I know that they had TWO valet area. Instead of offering to get my car another attendant began yelling at me to remember where I parked it. OK???? Incident #2 having lunch at the poolside cafe. My chair kept feeling weird and I look down and push my finger on the seat to find a screw coming out of the seat that was poking me in the butt and drew blood not realizing it was a sharp object. The manager comes over to me to apologize for my inept and hurting myself. Excuse me....you don't notice sharp objects that are poking out of your furniture? Again the customer service is sub-par having been offered a $15 compensation for my drink? They didn't even apologize for the issue but told me that it was my fault that I hurt myself on their furniture. Incident #3 trying to grab a quick snack at their grab and go place. Grabbed a box that had sliced apples carrots and an egg. It was not taped shut and opened inside the apples were brown and mushy and the carrots had that nasty film on them when you know they are old. GROSS! The employees behind the counter didn't even flinch. Oh and lastly the room that we booked was supposed to give us views of the volcano eruptions and such never once did we see the volcano erupt and we paid extra for that room :( Las Vegas and their hotels bank on their customer service to continue to bring back customers. Not this one and never again at the Mirage Hotel.Hey Mirage management if you get a chance to read this I think your employees definitely need some training in modern day customer service techniques.
30,Unlike most Vegas visitors I don’t have a go-to hotel because I like to change the experience each time. Admittedly The Mirage was not my first choice during our recent visit however considering it’s an MGM hotel I figured the stay couldn’t be horrible.    The food at their restaurants was pretty good. Had some great wings at LVB Burger and I found the Cravings Buffett much better than the Bayside Buffett at Mandalay Bay. The Pantry’s breakfast was cool however I did not care for the potatoes at all. They were greasy and egregiously lacked seasoning and flavor.    The room was a pretty standard hotel room but as a king it felt small and confined. Also as many reviews noted the rooms are VERY DATED and could certainly use an upgrade. As you will see from my pictures our headboard was ripped in several places. Also housekeeping does not dust or wipe the headboards down very well as there was a pretty significant buildup on top of it. The iron in our room also did not work well. I was baffled at how it clearly got hot but it did not do a good job in actually pressing the wrinkles out clothes.    Our room was pretty warm much warmer than we care for however front desk sent someone up immediately and they fixed it on the spot! That quick response made our stay much more comfortable.    The restaurant/bar The Still had a DJ Friday night playing awesome salsa music. There was a ballroom dancing event the weekend we visited and the dancers were there letting their hair down dancing away! It lended to a pretty fun environment. Not sure if it’s always like that but the vibe was pretty cool.    All in all would I go back to The Mirage? Sure I would. Would it be my first choice? Probably not however we DID have amazing trip while we were there and for that I’m grateful.
20,"Checking in we were told that no upgrade was possible because we were in the ""best suite offered by the Mirage"". On the 30th floor a one bedroom ""penthouse"" suite.    Well....it's a sad commentary when thier ""best suite"" doesn't have a TV that worked (only took 2 hourse for maintaince to come and fix it upon arrivale) and a bathtub that does NOT hold water! (we called maintaince at 5:45 and so far at 6:46 after a 2nd call - STILL nobody to fix it). At least the Hotel 6 has tubs that hold water.    It's a TIRED hotel. Once upon a time it may have been special but now the only thing worse than their version of luxury is their verion of service.    Tried to call front desk - but they were too busy to pick up the phone."
10,Hotel outdated. Race book needs to be redone to provide the player with an exceptional experience. TVs in the individual player spaces don’t work half the time. Owner should fly to Reno Peppermill and look at their race book.
40,The pool was amazing and very relaxing. Housekeeping staff was wonderful. Location was not ideal for what we were doing and had to uber instead of walking the strip. Mlife rewards didn’t seem to give me credits for gambling there or big expenses at other Mlife hotels. Overall was good but not great.
40,The resort is beautiful the staff friendly and accommodating. My issue was i paid for early checkin checked in via the mobile app at 11:30am waited for almost 12 hours never got a confirmation that my room was ready in any form and at 10:30pm that night had to complain to get my room was told they would comp my early checkin fee and that never happened.
50,We had an Awesome weekend at The Mirage attended the WNBA 2019 Allstar game and then Dinner and Drinks at Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak... Fabalous would return again and again. Even with the Grasshopper Invasion.. LOL.
50,One of the best mgm hotels that i have stayed at. I will definitely stay here again. And the buffet is not bad prices and the food is good also. I will return to this place soon.    Thanks mirage you did good
40,We enjoyed our stay and liked the location of the hotel. The room was stated it definitely needed some updating. If you are wanting to use the pool make sure you’re down there early! People put towels out on the chairs to reserve them and then don’t show up for hours.
50,Best Place Ever; fun and relaxing by the pool. Great food staff shops. Had a great time as we were celebrating a bachelorette party - super great experience. Another plus it didn't smell like smoke as other casino's do. We will def stay their again! Beds were super comfortable - what kind of pillows were those??? :)
50,I have stayed at the Mirage in the past (many years ago) and they have put in more restaurant/bar options. The pool is really pretty but very busy.  Room - Stayed in the 2 bedroom penthouse suite which was awesome. Our room was not ready until 5:30 which was a disappointment but they did give us a credit.  Positives: The room is very big. The beds are very comfortable. The master bathroom is huge!  Negatives: There is not a coffee maker or microwave which I thought would be available in a suite. There are also no plugins next to the bed so you have to pull out the bed to plug them in behind the bed. There is a marque of the Beatles on the window so the view is not as great unless you stay away from the window. No shower gel.  Overall I would highly recommend the Mirage and especially the penthouse suite.
40,Every time we go to Vegas we stay at the Mirage. It’s not super fancy but it’s a very comfortable place with an easy lay out. It seems they are constantly updating it so it seems fresh and new. We could very well stay somewhere else but we really enjoy The Mirage
50,Fast friendly service. Our stay was made better with the beautiful facility and fun things to do. I highly recommend The Mirage for a fun/business experience. Our room was bright quite and a restful place to regroup. We had a lot of fun thanks to The Mirage!
40,Came in for a quick 1 night stay in order to see a show. Overall good stay. Decent sized room that was clean and had a view of the volcano. Room was in tower 24 that is conveniently located right by their excellent Italian restaurant and right by the spa and theater where are show was so couldnt have had a better room location. Couple small things. We arrived a little early. Our room wasnt ready (we were a tad early) but when I checked to see when (cause we had a massage booked) we were offered a slight upgrade for about $15. We liked the room but literally as we took the room key we got an text that are original room was ready. Alos be aware that if you move ANYTHINGfrom the room frig you risk being charged. We had a leftover sandwich I put in the frig and took out a couple bottles of beer to make room. The frig has weight sensors so they tried ot charge us for the beer that was removed. There is a sign on the inside of the frig which is easy to miss if all you are doing is putting something in
50,Best tropical pool on the strip. I wouldn’t pay any extra for reserving chairs etc.. or upgrade to the other pool. Your offered to go to the other pool complimentary if main pool is over crowded. Location is perfect use the walkways to go from hotel to hotel in lieu of walking across street. Room was comfortable. Didn’t mind having the Mountain View because your spending little time in room. Highly recommend seeing Beatles Love!!!
50,I enjoyed every night at this hotel.Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. If I plan my vacation in Las Vegas I will definitely book a room at The Mirage Hotel and Casino.  Thank you for making my stay unforgettable!
50,The property is so nice and lush with all of the tropical plants and palm tree it really is a beautiful and relaxing hotel. I agree with some of the other folks that the room was a little dated but impeccably maintained and clean. The maids do a great job every day of cleaning the rooms. Our room was on the 22nd floor over looking the volcano it was awesome. The only minor complaint is the bathroom was a little small but other than that the room was clean and comfortable. Plus you are in the center of the strip.
50,My stay at the Mirage was awesome! It made my birthday weekend exceptional! Everyone seemed to know it was my birthday and had no issue with wising me a happy one! I felt so special. Thank you! Thank you for making my 55th Birthday a special occasion.
50,The room was fantastic. The staff was outstanding. The food was great. I would highly recommend this hotel. Cleanliness was a big factor with me as well. My stay was for six nights And enjoyed every one of them immensely
30,The Mirage in Las Vegas has great rooms nice big and comfortable . You don’t get what you pay for with all the extras that the Mirage adds to your bill. The view wasn’t great from the room we were in. We looked out onto the roof of a building.
20,This is the second time that I have stayed st the Mirage. Both times it took over 30 minutes to check in due to technical issues. They should have a manual contingency plan when this happens. Offering a bottle of water while standing in long line did not improve the situation.
30,Need improvements  need to improve their towards guests on to respond politely. Let guests that they feel help in what they need even though sometimes it doesn't work for them just to make them relax for anything right.
30,Second stay at the Mirage and would not return. Other than the restaurants staff was not very friendly or accommodating. Room we paid extra for was in serious need of some improvement. Hallway to our room smelt like urine. Overall not the luxurious vibe we were looking for in Las Vegas.
50,We loved the room location of the hotel and friendliness of the staff. We had a few little things with the staff but nothing serious. Would definitely stay again and plan more to do at the hotel because they had a lot going on.
30,The hotel was clean the rooms were clean and neat. The casino was quite busy and clean. The staff worked hard to present it in the best light possible. The pool area was nice and free of nuisances such as bugs.
50,We stayed as a family (2 adults and a 16 year old ) . The room we had was on the 23rd floor which meant that we were not disturbed by any outside noise and had a great view of the strip and the volcano. The hotel was nicely placed along the strip so we didn't have to walk far to eat (as it was like walking in an oven when we were there  this was important ). Be prepared for everything to be expensive but this is the same anywhere along the strip. The swimming pool was lovely clean and tidy. All of the staff we spoke to were friendly and helpful. The only thing that I would of liked in our room was a kettle rather than having to go downstairs to get a coffee in the morning .
40,We were on the 4th floor with a view of a rooftop so that wasn't great.... but all in all the hotel is fine and we got a decent deal but it does seem like everything costs extra.... from the $42 'resort fee' to an extra $25 if you decide you want to check out two hours later.... a bit ridiculous really.... I don't mind paying a room rate but I'd prefer it all be included rather than a ruse about resort fees and then extra fees for everything else. Proximity on the strip is great to walk around this is the best of the hotel. It is an old hotel but they seem to try to keep up on maintenance and other than the weird old shower over tub and curtain it isn't too obvious this was my grandparents hotel of choice in the 80's. Smoke smell in the casino is also a bit better than some of the other choices on the strip
50,My husband and I go to Vegas yearly in July for a week. We have stayed at several of the hotels on the strip. This was our third time at the Mirage. We love it there and will stay there again next year.
50,Great shows at the MGM family (Mirage - Saw Beatle’s Love Cirque du Soleil - outstanding!) (MGM Grand - Brad Garrett’s Comedy Club w/ Greg Morton Jason Collings Jay Hollingsworth - first - Garrett is so intelligent and biting in his ability to read people and the situation. He is so damn funny. He is the modern quick-witted Don Rickles. Greg Morton is so talented and his humor is unique and interesting. Collings is super funny with his observations about entitled kids and people that he hates. David Copperfield - his new story is one of inspiration and his magic is magnificent and awe-inspiring) (Maverick Helicopter ride to Grand Canyon with Canyon Sky Walk - amazing. The Mirage hotel experience was fabulous - the people are awesome and the facility is great. We loved the gaming the food and the awesome room (a suite)!
30,One nighter on way back from Page Arizona and chose the hotel as we were watching the Shin Lim Magic Show (which was good!).    Nice hotel room overseeing the strip and volcano... the room was definitely run down compare to the Venetian (which we stayed for one night on our way to Page) but we visited the pool in the morning before we checked out and it looked nicer than the other hotel in mention.    One issue I have to point out and no real fault to the hotel.... I went out to meet a friend for a drink and was gaming. Returned around 2 am and my key card did not work... so I had to walk all the way down to the check in desk and only to be told that I could not get the replacement because its under my wife's name... so they had to get a security guard to go with me to open the door and show my passport (all that is fine). My only issue is the long walk up and down at 2 am and the matter took around 20-30 mins to resolve... I think the solution is to register more than one name because to be honest the card machines do look like they belong to the 1980s...    I think I liked it better than The Venetian but my spouse thinks otherwise... I also managed to visit my friend at the Wynn... and that was better than both hotels...
40,Our hotel rooms were great. Good size and nicely appointed. The hotel itself was also nice big resort type pool nice shops and good restaurants.  However I struggled that we had to walk through the casino to get anywhere and that most if not all of the hotel restaurants were right inside the smokey casino. We got lost in the maze of the casino trying to get to the front door and had to find restaurants outside the hotel given the location of the ones inside the casino. I also found the number of people who had drinks on the edge of the pool meant that the cleaners couldnt keep up. I think that is just Vegas.
30,We stayed at the Mirage this past week for an event. It was six nights. My first impression was it needed updating. The carpeting in well worn in casino and our room staff was very friendly and accommodating. We ate at LVB grill and it was good The Still was also okay but The Pantry for breakfast was not very good. We tried several entrees. Our room was clean but towels on two separate days were stained. When we got into bed there was some type of tape on the sheet when my husband put his feet in. It did come off easily. Gross. I would have thought when the bed was made it would have been noticed as it was yellow. Price was right but next time I would choose somewhere else.
10,You definitely will never see me at this casino/hotel ever again.    The room stayed hot I called to have it taken care of and never was seen about.      I paid for an upgrade to only have to walk down the hall with wet carpet fan blowing to dry it.  The ceiling tile missing  the hall looked horrible with missing tile.  If this was a upgrade pretty dam sad.  Went to pool could hardly hear music.  Serve was horrible at the pool only two bartenders to handle a crowd of people.
50,Nice rooms great location wonderful pool. The staff is what made the stay nice though. I tried three different MGM properties and the Mirage is the one I intend to return to. The waterfall at the pool is a family favorite.
30,"We originally booked a stip view King but we were a day earlier than we thought arriving so we took wellness room. We really liked our wellness room at the MGM grand last year so we thought this would be similar. Not. The room was just a regular room with some scented air. Instead of strip p view we looked over the garage. really dated small bathroom. I called the next morning to see about a change and there was no problem with that although we had to $25 more per the remaining nights. The switch was handled well - we were able to stay in our original room until our new room was ready. The new room does have a nice view out to the volcano and across to the Venetian but it is the same size as the first room. The bathroom is much nicer with two sinks and a shower separate from a nice deep tub. The main complaint about both rooms is the inadequate number of plug ins for charging our devices and their awkward positioning. The plug ins are across the room. The outlets on the bed side are very difficult to reach and are filled with the lamp plugs. The king bed is comfortable.  Big complaint is there is no coffee maker in the room. So we are stuck with going down to find coffee in the lobby first thing in the morning - get it from the cocktail waitresses and tip them $2 because if you ask for a cup of black coffee at the bar as I did my first morning you will be set back almost $5 for one cup.  We will order room service for tomorrow - and just pay the price.  We had breakfast yesterday at the Carnegie Deli - ""latkes"" are just heavy blobs of mashed postatoes that are put on the grill - no lightness or flakiness to them.  The food at the MGM is better.  Not a bad strip hotel but the accommodations definitely need some updating."
50,We had a look around a few hotels on The Strip and are convinced we made the right choice. We liked the relaxed vibe at The Mirage and it smells so good every time you walk through the front door from the heat of the street. It is spotlessly clean. The ‘volcano’ is great fun (crazier than the neighbouring Bellagio fountains) and the in-house Beatles Love show by Cirque du Soleil is jaw dropping brilliance! As with most Vegas spots be prepared to pay through the nose for food and drink.
50,We love to stay in the Mirage. It is very convenient to most of the places on the strip that we enjoy. The size is easy to navigate and the people are all very friendly. The table limits are to our liking and the dealers make it fun. We look forward to returning soon.
50,This hotel makes you feel VIP every day you are their guest! It met my expectations and a lot more! Everyone is so friendly! It was a fun and exciting trip for us. Everyone had something to do. Loved the pool with the cabañas and the Dolphins Park!
50,The rooms at the Mirage are clean and updated nicely. And the beds are super comfy. The staff was friendly and helpful. The pool area was very nice with a tropical settling and lots of seating. It was a great experience.
50,The hotel experience was so nice and pleasant.I wii be telling a friend and my kin even that Helier I hate. Everyone that works for the Mirage was so nice friendly and helpful they made our still very memorable.
50,My favorite vacation spots... Love come in his place the heart of Vegas strip... Can’t wait to come back staff shows down to the maintenance and and the people that clean the room are all very good to me and my wife
50,"Great Place To Stay In Vegas.  Excelent Service Friendly Staff Great Food & Beverages in all The Venues That we visited confortable & clean rooms the pools are a great place to relaxing and enjoy plus The Excellent and Exepcional Performance of The Cirque Du Soleil ""Love"""
50,The hotel was in a great location and very clean also they have a couple of good restaurants inside that I would eat at again. The most impressive thing is how secure the pool area was and also at night how the security was verifying your access to your rooms.
40,We love the shows the atmosphere and the people watching in Vegas. What we hadn't done much of before was enjoy the Pools. We loved the waterfall at The Mirage and the staff was great. We had drinks brought to us and had a great time lounging.
50,We enjoyed our stay here the room was spacious and clean. The hotel is conveniently located with lots of things to see do and eat nearby. The pool was decent if a bit crowded but definitely not a party scene. The staff were friendly and helpful any time we needed them although the check-in took a very long time.  We paid extra for a volcano view room which was not worth it. It would have been great if we just wanted a view of the strip (we were looking towards TI Wynn and Trump). Do not book if just for the volcano view though. The windows were dirty and dusty from the outside and the hotel shines lights up at the building to light it up at night which impedes the volcano view. Also the volcano eruption really needs to be seen from the street level looking at it from the top ruined the effect. On the plus side the room was at the far end of the hall and very quiet.
30,Room bed pillows excellent  Cleanness excellent  Wished they use germ killer in bathroom shower sink area after each guests leaves  just to make sure  Floor by pool slick  I fell dislocated shoulder  The hotel provided zero help  Just their risk management called me  Good too expensive  Not about money  It’s about feeling of getting ripped off  Hamburger $20 with drink bacon tip $40  Water in room &18  Chips $15  Go figure
30,I think the Cesar and a few more hotels are nicer to stand in the Mirage. At the end of the day it was just OK nothing too special about it and all the restaurants that we tasted in the hotel or two expensive and did not taste very good.
30,Room is small and restroom is tiny and a bit dated. For the price there are definitely better hotels out there especially after the resort fee charges are applied. Casino are was nice and staff was friendly and location was great.
50,This was my third time staying at the Mirage and it seems to be my new go to hotel. Had a regular volcano view room this time and finally got to see the show from above. Trip was pleasant with only one minor problem. The safe malfunctioned when I tried to lock it but they sent a tech who fixed it within 10 minutes. Love this hotel for the location and the friendly staff.
40,Great place to stay on the Vegas strip we will be back. The location is the best part it is located right in the center of everything. The room was clean and spacious. Check in and out was easy and quick. The only downfall is the walk from self parking/lobby to the guest elevators is quite a distance. You have to walk through the entire casino with your bags before getting to the elevators. Other than that this is a lovely hotel and great quality for the price.
50,Awesome Hotel. It's located in a good spot on the Strip the price is incredible for the quality of the hotel and all the staff through out the Hotel and Casino were great. The gym spa and pool is what I use every time I stay at a hotel and this one had it all. This is my place to stay every time I'm on the Strip.
30,Great hotel for the value. Essentially a Holiday Inn on top of a resort with MGM perks. The only notable drawback were the rooms which could use a refresh -- particularly the bathroom. Otherwise great hotel with plenty of food options great pool and the staff get an A+
40,Our first stay. Room was clean quiet and comfortable. Staff was courteous and professional. Just beware the time share people on property who will lie to you get you to The Jockey Club under false pretenses and then you'll be stuck!
40,We had a much more enjoyable room stay this time compared to this past spring. Two bedroom suite as last time. This one was clean when we arrived and kept clean during our stay.... Best pool on the Strip. Postmodern Jukebox at 1 Oak. Great time.
40,Mirage rooms were very clean. Housekeeping did a fantastic job. The hotel is also very close to the other shopping centers. Did not do much gambling but the casino was very clean. I would definitely stay here again!
50,Great location. great pool. Had a good time. LVB burger is amazing.    Beatles is average mostly focuses on cool costumes and pretty colors. Not much action or theatrics. Rooms are nice. Free parking is just a small shuttle ride away at treasure island.
50,The hotel is very easy to navigate and the staff is very friendly. I especially enjoyed having the ability to watch the volcano from my room and visiting with teh dolphins and the big cats in their Secret Garden.
50,The Mirage is a very clean and great place to stay. The staff is so helpful and ready to help. I was impressed with the food and casino. Also very convienient for walking on the strip. Would reccomend this place to anyone.
40,Nice clean hotel. Nice pool area. Good restaurants. Only reason for not giving it an excellence is would have like to seen some options to grab something like a slice pizza or something along those lines without having to order to go from a restaurant or room service.
30,I have been going to Vegas for almost 30 years and used to stay at the Mirage often but switched to other hotels. I stayed there for a short 2 night stay in June and was very disappointed. I have recommended this hotel to friends & family over the years. I woke up and found a small bug in my bed took a picture of it & went discreetly down to the front desk to tell them. I was not looking for any compensation the women at the desk wasn’t even apologetic it was no big deal I was very surprised. Showed her the picture she wanted to know if the bug was still there I told her I flushed it down toilet which I think is common sense to do. Her attitude was very odd to me I have better things to do in Vegas then complain about a bug. They moved me to another room for the 2nd evening but who could sleep after that. I know this can happen anywhere but the way they had no sympathy for this was very disappointing to say the least. Sadly I will never stay here again or recommend this hotel to anyone.
40,We stayed for a week in the mirage can't fault location and all staff were generally nice. Only thing I didn't think was good wsd the resort fees you don't get anything worth while for them no free shows or anything only WiFi big wow. We visited every hotel and I would say there is better options for sure but would recommend it. It was a lot better than I expected the resort fees seem a Vegas thing.    Rooms cleaned daily and the staff were great. They should maybe offer free shows or the habitat for free really.
40,We went there with my daughter and son in law. We had an amazing time.we had breakfast at The Pantry drinks at the Still Parlor Lonunge and bugers and chicken wings at the LVB BURGERS. Everything was delicious. My husband and daughter were busy at the casino and we spent many hours at there and drinks are free while playing. The pool are is beautiful and was packed. The rooms we were in had two queenbeds and we were ok with that. The hotel is a bit dated but was very busy. Located central as we found convenient to walk across to Denny's  Macdonals Walgreens Margaritaville and many more. Overall had a wonderful time and met our expectations.
50,We stayed in the Tower Suite and it was beautiful. The staff was extremely friendly and the resort was very clean. The food at the Pantry was delish and service was quick.. however there was always a line for breakfast.
30,The hotel is showing sign of aging. Headboards are ripped and informed the manager and he acknowledged and informed me they are being replaced. Not happy with the manager response. I am in Vegas three to four times a year. Next trip I will stay at another resort. This was by fifth stay at Mirage and was loyal to Mirage; not anymore.
50,Kimberly was amazing and her colleagues and one issue previously has been truely corrected by the excellent after service.    I feel like Mirage is home when I visit Vegas. The pool is still the best with the tropical feel and ample shade if u get a lounger early . Rooms are great . Location is the best . Connected to Caesar’s Palace with ease . Highly recommend.
50,Had a good time enjoyed my 2 day comp room stay. Mini vacay.. hated the heat but the overall stay was great. Would love to stay again. Love the willy Wonka slot. The best. Hotel was excellent didnt spend much time in the room
40,First time staying at the Mirage. I liked the rooms. They were very nice and clean. Only thing is I wish they allowed us to put some of our drinks in the mini fridge. Its filled with their items. Too expensive. Other than that had a nice time.
10,There was a chewing gum stuck on my bathroom floor. The bathroom sink didn’t drain water. Yuuuuckk🤢🤮 The AC didn’t keep the room cool at night. And it took over 1 hr for Pantry to deliver my food and not to mention sky high prices for room delivery
50,They went out of their way to make us feel like family. Bravo to the Love show Terry Fator show. Clean great pool and a amazing view. R view looked over the strip. Manny from the Love show was amzing showing us the Love Show up close.
40,Need a fridge for my drinks that is free of charge it will be nicer  Everything else was nice  Also don’t like that you have to pay for parking when you staying  But thanks we had a good time  ...........
50,Really enjoyed the stay. Very clean quiet and comfortable. The housekeeping staff was very friendly. The pool was super relaxing. The food was excellent from room service to the Carnegie Deli... cheesecake anyone? Thank you!
10,From the very immediate start of our vacation this hotel jerked us around I had two rooms because it was me my wife and 3 kids over charged us for pretty much everything no military discounts and made the entire 5 days frustrating and inconvenient. from the service at the counter all the way to every restaurant we went to. including the casino floor where there is hardly any drink girls walking around. The only thing good out of the entire place was the service at the cabana we purchased on Saturday. She was great although of course we were paying for it but then again we were paying top dollar for the mirage also. we did everything you had to offer from the dolphin meet and greets to dinners at each restaurant. Absolutely Abysmal service. we will never stay again and I will also be posting a yelp review facebook hotels.com and any other site I can possibly think of that's how much I despise this hotel now. I can't believe how we were treated. Thanks for ruining our vacation Mirage.    Staff is all rude and incompetent gust room I had first was on the 24th floor and it was great but our other room was on the 16th floor which was in another tower so we couldn't do that I had asked from the beginning for a conjoining room but it's not guaranteed so at least wanted close by room. Called when I got my pre check in room numbers the lady rude and mean and gave me an option for the 2nd floor. we waiting until we got to our rooms I called the manager and he put me right next to the 16th floor room. which unfortunately was not nearly as nice as the 24th floor room we had but we had to be close together. Can't believe it was such an issue to get two rooms close together. So after ALLL of that we tried to shake it off but being met day after day night after night with rude service we had enough. I tried to call to switch hotels to the Mandalay because we've stayed their before and it's been great but they were booked up. The italian food restaurant is overpiced and the waiter is unfriendly. I ordered in wings once for my wife and the brought the wrong ones so i called and told them then when they brought the correct order they asked for the other ones back and got upset because I ate them what were they going to do with them anyways?
50,"We stayed at the Mirage after several reviews recommended it for traveling with kids. We are SOOOO pleased this was where we ended up.    BOOKING: Go ahead and call. The staff is so helpful. We were signed up for MLife almost immediately and received excellent discounts on shows we were also booking at that time. We easily saved several hundred dollars on Copperfield and Cirque's O for our party of 9.    CHECK-IN/ROOMS: I wish I hadn't ignored the email to download the app so we could have done mobile check in (the check in line can be long at times). However once it was our turn the staff found our adjoining rooms all close together on the same floor. TIP: It's worth paying the extra $ for early check in if you're arriving before 3. Only one other room happened to be ready before that time. Rooms themselves are large and comfortable with contemporary finishes and i don't think there's really a ""bad"" view in the house. Hallways were mostly quiet on our stay (typical loud door closing from time to time but nothing awful). AC was effective AND quieteverything worked as expected would have been nice to have a little space in the mini fridge for personal items and not just minibar items but again not a deal breaker). Very clean rooms with an attentive staff.    POOL: This was one of the highlights of our trip. If you're looking for a peaceful yet fun oasis this is the place. This is not a nightclub experience on water - it's a chill relaxing outdoor hangout that's 100% kid parent and grandparent appropriate. Servers are quick friendly and attentive and if you're a larger party the cabanas are well worth it because of extras that are included such as pool floats snacks and non-alcoholic drinks. We also found that you can do the private oasis (21-and-up not topless/naked) if all you need is a few chairs and the same level of extra attention at a more ""value"" cost.    CASINO: We had the opportunity to visit several other properties during our stay. We very much preferred the Mirage to all others. It is clean updated-yet-still has the touch of 'classic Vegas' on it has several $10 minimum tables (even at night) never ever got crazy crowded and the dealers/croupiers/bosses were very friendly and loved the opportunity to teach you something new.    RESTAURANTS: There is not a bad choice here. Buffet breakfast quick bites fine dining bars. Mirage excels in every direction."
10,My first time I book at this hotel and it will be the last the front desk staff is horrible at the pool is also the same. I will never return to this hotel. they never solved my problem the supervisor never attended to me
10,When we checked in 2 hours early we had to pay $35 extra the Furniture in the Room were very outdated need to be replace.and the Carpet was also very old had rust in the Tub Faucet was all loose. the toilet seat was also loose. Room like this should not be rented.
30,Hotel stay was nice rooms are a little dated. Food service to the room very long wait nearly 1 hour and 15 minutes when quoted 30-45 min. Casino slots tight but tables ran very well. Lost about $1500 over all but had a good time on the casino floor and pool area.
10,Mirage did not make Vegas trip special in any way. Go elsewhere. Front desk staff rude and condescending. There was a charge for every service where good or bad. M Life program was pretty liam use other promos.
40,I went to Las Vegas for a conference which is held at the Mirage. My 3rd time attending this conference held at the Mirage but it was my 1st time staying there but God willing not my last. I checked in and asked about a room with 2 beds (I booked a king room with a strip view) but decided to bring my niece; to my surprise the front desk agent said she could upgrade us to a 2 bedroom penthouse suite!! This suite was AMAZING!! 2 bedrooms 2 bathrooms 4 TVs Livingroom Dining room fully stocked wet bar (I didn't drink & she's not old enough to drink). The view was breathtaking especially with the floor to ceiling glass walls. The hotel is nice and every employee I encountered was extremely helpful. There was some confusion regarding the cost I was quoted for the upgrade and what I was charged... but hotel management and the MGM's customer experience team were able to satisfactorily resolve the issue. The restaurant's are pricey but the food is good (the pantry & the Italian restaurant right next to it). I enjoyed my 8 day/ 7 night stay 😊
50,Stay at this hotel and see the LOVE cirque show! Great show great service great pool!! This was an overall excellent trip. The mirage is in a great location. Stroll down to see the fountains at the Bellagio and tKe in the wax museum. Don’t forget to sign up for your mlife card!
50,Such a beautiful property. The pool is amazing and we love all the restaurants. Rooms are clean and staff are friendly and helpful. We stay at the Mirage more than any other hotel....location is ideal!
50,Greeted by incredible bell hop who we found out was former Olympic boxer and proceeded to meet the nicest person in the world at check in. Room a little dated but not smoky. Over all a great hotel with fantasy pool. Would definitely go back again!!
50,This hotel was family friendly. The front desk has mobile check in and out which was super convenient. The rooms are super clean. The buffet was affordable for anytime of the day and it was delicious. I definitely will be coming back here to this hotel
30,Ideally I would give the resort a 3.5 stars. What put me off immediately was the fact that the gentleman (David) at the check-in counter told us he could get us a great upgrade. We were offered a 2 bedroom suite for an additional $100 per night. A good deal but we did not need 2 bedrooms so we asked if something smaller was available for a cost closer to what we were already paying. He was certain he could hook us up left the counter and entered a room where he remained for 5-10 minutes. When he came back he said no upgrade was available but he did secure us a room with an amazing view of the mountains and lower strip. We went to our room (which was at the very end of a long hallway) to find a view of a rooftop with a little bit of mountain and a couple casinos visible. The room was very small especially the bathroom. I can honestly say it was the worst room I have stayed at on the strip. The casino itself was decent although it felt a bit claustrophobic due to low ceilings. The amenities were good but I would have liked more musical entertainment/lounge areas. We took in the Love show which was disappointing. All in all a decent stay but with all the other choices on the strip I would probably stay somewhere else next time.
50,We had the one bedroom suite on the C floor and it was amazing. Great view of the mountains and partial view of the strip. The bed was extremely comfortable. No noise on the floor and very clean. The bathroom is huge. Only con was that there was no outlet in the bedroom for our cellphones to charge unless you unplug the lamp or clock otherwise we will definitely stay here again
40,My experience in a rash was phenomenal as always with the dolphins and the tigers and the wildlife and everything my only bad experience was with the dealers you’re really mean and then room toilet will not flush other than that it was a phenomenal stay even did good gambling
40,We have stayed at the Mirage twice in the last 6 months. Carnegie Deli is amazing. Had a tattoo done at Starlight which is in the hotel. Central on the strip so great for making the most of the sights. Rooms are clean and well maintained. My only negative comment is I wish there were more servers in the slot areas. I’m guessing it is that way for a reason.
20,"I don't know why they charge such a high ""resort fee"" and you still have to pay for parking as a guest. That's robbery. What exactly does the resort fee cover if I'm already paying to stay at the resort?"
50,First time staying at The Mirage and everything was perfect. The Mirage met all my expectations and I would definitely stay at The Mirage again. Highly recommend going to Bare pool had a blast!!! Great location!!!!
30,We selected this hotel because of the location and package purchase with hotel and air. Our room was below average but the other couples we traveled with had great rooms. Won't stay at this hotel.again but the location was great.
50,Staying at the mirage is the best location with regards to the middle of the strip and getting to see everything. we love to walk each day and you can get right on the the strip immediately without walking through a big casino or hotel.I can stay anywhere but I prefer the Mirage hands down.
50,Great location on the strip. Convenient Walgreens across the street. 24hr pantry was great. Pool lounge chairs were really close to one another. Other guys I traveled with stayed at Bally’s and another at stratosphere. I liked our hotel the best
50,Hotel is in a great location. Close to everything you need. The pool is nice and big lots of chairs. Bare pool was a great time and drinks awesome. Only ate at one restaurant but food and drinks were very good.
40,Very nice rooms but the view was instructed. The staff was very helpful and the location is great right on the strip in the heart of everything. I think the plants and aquarium really added to the decor.
40,Buffet was okay but mostly just because we had buy oneget one buffets. Pool is nice rooms are great slots were tight our dollar didn't go as far as some of the other hotels free games were very rare.
30,Stayed here only one night to make up for a change in flight plans. Got a good rate online and our room was supposed to be a two queen suite. We got upgraded to a tower suite because they gave away our room. It was a large king suite where they wheeled in two rollaway beds. Not really what we wanted despite the room being bigger. Not sure how checking in at 7pm we lost our original room. Love the location and pool facility.
50,The Mirage will make you feel at home the staff are friendly and courteous. I felt welcomed and saw smiles all around me. I know other places in Vegas cost less but you definitely get what you pay for! I would highly recommend The Mirage
40,Was here to support my friend during a slot machine tournament and the room is clean the casino is small but it has the old machines and newer ones. It is beneficial that you obtain an M card if you are planning to play the slot machines because you earn credits and if you spend like 500 dollars they give you like $30 free play. Spending doesn’t mean the total money out of your pocket. It includes the winnings you had as long as you play them again. For example my capital was $100 but since I won $230 on a penny slot machine  $120 on a $1 slot machine and $140 on a quarter slot machine - and I played all those winnings again I ended up spending more than $500 so I got $30 free play. All in all I still ended up winning 95 bucks.  Now the room - it is clean and the beds are comfy but sometimes the key doesn’t work. I also don’t like that you have to go through the casino to get to your rooms. At night make sure you have your key because security checks your room key before you can enter the elevator.  Buffet is good but it is more expensive during the weekends because they add crabs but it is still good during the weekdays.  They also have Starbucks on the first floor as well as California pizza kitchen.  I would recommend mirage for your stay
10,"I called excited to book the ""be a trainer for a day"" package with questions. 1st person to answer the phone sound upset to event speak and hung up. I called back confused but still willing to book and the 2nd person spoke with so with an aggressive tone. I had question yet she answered as if i was making wrong statements i told her i apologize i am just asking and she is speaking very aggressive she said "" not a problem speak to my manager"". I never asked to speak with a manager she did not let me speak and again got off the phone. This is so unprofessional I work front desk at my own job and would never treat a guest like this. DISAPPOINTED!"
20,The only good thing about the Mirage is the location. It is smack dab in the middle of the strip. The hotel itself is very outdated. My room when I checked in had a lot of soap scum and mildew in the bathroom. The room itself had ripped curtains. I changed my room and the new room was just as bad. The toilet wouldn’t flush. You can stay at the Linq across the street for a much better price and experience.
50,The Mirage is exactly what you think of when you think of a Vegas Resort. Upscale hotel facilities coupled with a great casino with an excellent selection of games. Then add some absolutely fantastic restaurants and you have an excellent Vegas experience.
40,We have been staying at the Mirage for 20 years and always love it here. We showed up for our room at 12:30 and they said our room was ready and that we would receive a text with the room number. When this did not happen after two hours we decided to go back to the front desk. The gentleman we had this time was no help and I found him very condescending. We finally got into our room at 5:30 and I think he purposely put us at the end of the hallway. The rest of our vacation was fine but this left a bad taste in our mouth.
10,Waited for 3 hrs with wife and 2 kids for our prebooked room (they apologized for the delay). Son and I were hassled by security for standing around (as my wife and daughter went to the restroom for 3 minutes as we were waiting for our room). I felt like we had to keep walking while waiting. No hospitality so we kept moving for that 3 hours. VERY dusty room. Rusty bathtub. Shower head not working. Bathroom fan loud/not working. Dirty/stained towels. Typical budget hotel experience. Good food and great bell desk staff. Also bedroom doors slam very loudly so you hear neighbors several rooms down! Never again.
20,4 service calls. And even after being told it was fixed. Each day when I returned to my room. There was a non functioning toilet. Was extremely disappointed. Talked to the front desk manager on my last night and they credited some of my charges but not having a working toilet was a massive frustration.
50,This holiday has restored my faith in in people and especially our American brothers.  Check in was Great upgraded dye to our anniversary and my wife's birthday. The team were fantastic.  Facilities at the mirage were great you don't realise how great until you walk the strip and visit a few of the other hotels.  Great position for walking the strip and a good location to be able to get off the strip.  The place on the whole is vibrant mad fun hot and believe it or not resting!  The people made it for me having been to Dominican Mexico and other carabean islands I have found North Americans and Canadians to be brash a bit ignorant and LOUD. This break has made me realise that I should not be stereo typical and broaden my own horizons. From reception bar restaurant in fact all of the device people we encounted and especially all American people you were fantastic and welcoming.  Great hotel great resort fantastic people
30,"The hotel was nice. However the buffet is really gross! About 15 years ago it was ""the"" place to eat. Not anymore!!!! The rooms were nice though. I had a problem with my TV and the maintenance people fixed it very quickly! They were great. Just eat somewhere else."
10,Bill included a charge that I don't recognize. Watch your bill and make sure you don't get charged for any extras that you didn't buy. My whole trip was soured by this bad experience and I definitely will not be coming back to the Mirage again.
50,We love this resort and feel it is the best place to stay in Vegas as far as location and the pool is awesome!! The buffet is priced very reasonably was a bit disappointed to see that the wine and beer is no longer included in the price but I guess things sometimes have to change!!!!
50,This is a wonderful hotel with great lighting and open ceilings. I love that it is very clean inside and this hotel has an awesome pool! I love betting on sports and horses and this hotel has a great sports book area too!
30,Stayed for one night courtesy of my airline who cancelled my flight. Hotel has all necessary comforts yet is a little dated. The rooms are spacious yet don’t have a real desk in them. The iron board was next to the cupboard. The shower wasn’t entirely clean and the bin had some empty toothpaste tube in it when I entered the room.  Wouldn’t be my preferred choice the Mandalay Bay rooms certainly provided a little more comfort.  The hotel is a little more central on the strip and has a decent breakfast place. Something I missed in the Mandalay Bay.
50,The buffet has great food. The rooms are great. The pool I love. The drinks are tasty. Great shopping. Awesome view. Can’t wait to take my family back to Vegas. The shows are cool. It’s a very stunning hotel. We will be back.
50,Clean room. Fridge and snacks get charged to your room. Just moving them to check them out will charge you. There is a sensor under each item so be forewarned. The staff were nice and helpful. The gaming areas were kept very clean as well. Beautiful tropical and exotic flowers were all around the waterfall.
10,This has been my favorite hotel to stay in Vegas for 20+ years so to say I am mortified after convincing 5 of my friends who have never been to Vegas to stay here this trip is an absolute understatement. It began when I did a mobile check-in at the 3:00pm - their check-in time and our digital key did not work when we arrived to the hotel at 11:00pm. The front desk informed me that the Penthouse Suite I was paying almost $1000/night for “wasn’t cleaned and ready” - 8 HOURS AFTER CHECK-IN TIME. She took my number told me it would be ready in an hour and that they would text me when it was ready. She gave us $150 food and beverage credit- for 6 of us. My dinner alone - no booze - was $86. At 12:45am I had still not received a text so I called the front desk who then informed me the room was ready and “you should have received a text”. The room should have been ready in the first place! I do not own credit cards so I used a debit card to pay for the rooms (I had 2 king resort rooms as well) so I did not have “an open line of credit and couldn’t charge anything to my rooms - cash/card payment required at all times”. I was unable to use the food and beverage credit because the only way they could comp it was if it was charged to the room.  The suite had a full-size refrigerator so we stopped and got some groceries on our way to check-in but the suite wasn’t ready when we arrived. We tried putting as much as we could in the mini-bar fridge in my King Resort room so it wouldn’t spoil and they charged me for “items that were “MOVED” in my mini-bar - not removed - just touched. Oh and the ice maker on my floor was inoperable from Tuesday through Friday so I had to order buckets of ice from room service just to have ice water. I reported it to front desk 3 days in a row to which they replied “it’s probably just making more ice”. I told them it said “Bin Full” and wasn’t trying to dispense ice at all and they said they’d have maintenance fix it. They “know it’s an inconvenience but we have ice makers on every floor”. If the one on my floor doesn’t work what makes urgent think I’m going to go on a scavenger hunt to every floor to find one that does work?  Two nights we tried to order from the 24/hr room service and they did not answer. I ordered 3 other nights and the food was really good.  The bathroom mirror light (the only light in there) wasn’t coming on so I called and they said to hold the reset button down for 30 seconds and it should come on. I had to do it every single time I went in there.  There are only 2 electric sockets near the bed - one on each side but the lamps and clock are plugged in there. I had to charge my phone laptop and other personal items across the room - just inconvenient and needs to be updated to 21st century needs.  The iron and ironing board are ancient and were worthless.  I rented movies at $11.00 for 24hrs but they buffered randomly.  The cleaning products they use in the room made me gag. It was ridiculously strong. I did not have my room cleaned once during my stay (by choice - I couldn’t take the smell being refreshed by cleaning). It wasn’t the typical pineapple smell they pump through the hotel to mask the smell of the natural gas from the volcano- I actually like that - it really helps with the cigarette smell in the casino. The rooms smelled like rotten ammonia.  I hung out at the pool during the day which has always been amazing. I paid $50/day for a chair at the Private Oasis which was a really nice option. It was calm relaxing and peaceful. Not that the main pool is crazy or anything but there’s umbrellas for every chair private waitresses and separate pool. The waitress the first day was awful so I went to the main bar for drinks and buckets of water but she was really good the following day so it could have been a fluke - either day.  I will miss the pools at the Mirage but I will never stay there again.
50,My wife and I stayed here for 7 nights. We couldn't have chosen any better.  We were given a room on the 23rd floor with a view of the mountains to the rear.  The room was a large family style twin. It was extremely clean with all the required facilities apart from tea/coffee making. You would have to visit the Starbucks on the casino level for this. We fortunately had our trusty kettle and tea bags with us.    Plenty of sockets and a couple of USB's. (It's a tip to take a small 3 or 4 socket extension lead then only 1 U.S adapter is required and English plugs can be just plugged in if required)    Room was cleaned daily albeit a little late in the afternoon.  It was a very quiet room during the whole stay.    We didn't sample any of the hostel restaurants as we have visited Vegas many times and had our preferences as to where we ate.    The Mirage like most hotels in Vegas have a resort fee included set up with a credit card and taken out of your account after checking out. Ours was around $39 a day plus tax. This covers use of facilities and mini bar contents water and snacks are charged if used.  My suggestion is don't even move them or you will be charged.    All in all this is most definitely a hotel that we will visit again and have already booked another stay in 2020.    Further more it is ideally situated central strip with easy access to all the nearby large hotels i.e Ceasars Paris Bellagio Venetian etc.    Great hotel superb stay.
50,The location was great the pool was very nice. Clean hotel with friendly staff. No matter where you stay the walk is complicated but couldn’t ask for a better location. Nice clean and safe parking garage.
50,The Mirage continues to be our go to resort on the Las Vegas strip. The location on the strip is excellent the resort is friendly and clean and the staff are excellent. Please stay here. The pool is beautiful with waterfalls and many palm trees. The dining is varied and delicious. Try the Avocado and chicken egg rolls at the California Pizza Kitchen. Enjoy
50,This is one of the best hotels I’ve been clean rooms good foodGreat hotel almost five stars unfortunately this is the second time that I noticed that the  cocktails waitress are not very friendly ( no hi no smile)
30,Needs to stop trying to push for upgrades when an upgrade has already been purchased. Focus on the quality of the room for the guest and what they are asking for. Horrible view and furthest from the elevators is not an ideal upgrade to pay for.
30,Rooms were clean but outdated. Small bathrooms. Great views and very kind staff! Especially housekeeping. However don't even open the mini fridge or they will accuse you of taking something out and charge you. Also $35 a day for a personal fridge to store your belongings? Absolutely ridiculous.
10,Arrived to a dirty room beds not made trash everywhere bathroom completely used called front desk in which took hours to get someone up to make situation right. even after they cleaned it was still below par leaving others trash still behind i will be coming back to vegas in oct 2019 and wont stay here! thumbs down
50,Loved everything but wish room had a fridge and coffee pot. Other than that it was a great time. Jaz at the pool bar was awesome!! Perfect center strip location. Will definitely stay here again if I go back to vegas.
50,Don't pass this place up! We always stay at the MGM. I will never go back to the MGM it will be the Mirage for now on!! Perfect location great value amazing pools! Clean and friendly staff! Do not pass!
10,Long 1hour+ check in line gave me keys to someone else's room. No attempt to satisfy my wife and I. Walked into a room with someone else's money credit cards clothes and hooker cards (that was great!)
50,Great food gambling was ok machines were very tight table games were to expensive you need to have a couple of 5 dollar tables. That way people stay in the casino instead of going down the strip to find better gambling. As a previous pit boss I understand what is needed to be more profitable.
50,The wife and I went out to Vegas to attend a destination wedding. Utilizing teh M-Life Rewards Program we stayed in a Great Room at a Great Resort with Great ammenities.    The staff was always professional and friendly everytime there was interaction. The Casino wasnt as tight as some of the others but that could be construed as just Good Luck??    The restaurants and bars were World Class with professional wait staff that was attentive to our wants and needs. The food and drinks were all great tasting served as if you were in a 5 star establishment.
30,"I will start with saying the accomodations themselves were fine. The room was large and the bed was comfortable. Where the hotel did fail?    When we checked in we were told as long as we stayed at the hotel parking was free. I was always under the impression that was a true statement and since he stated it I thought we were fine.    When we checked out there was a $60 charge for parking. When we inquired about it we were told rudely ""Too bad. It's the way it is.""    The other problem I had was with a $50 credit I was to receive with my reservation. When we checked in the gentleman helping us stated that when we get a room (there were none at check in-no biggy) the $50 would become available to use for food or drink. Nope.    Apparently you need a major credit card on file for it to be used. While I had one it was for travel home and the amount they wanted for this $50 credit was too high for us to assure we got home. A debit card (which I checked in with) is not acceptable. So we lost out on a dinner but it really doesn't matter.    Most of the staff that we encountered were confused by simple questions about the casino. And clearly the gentleman checking us in was new but at least he asked questions just not the right ones.    The stay itself was not bad. A few slamming doors late at night typical hotel activity but mostly quiet. We liked the California Pizza Kitchen LVB Burgers and the Pantry. I would avoid Cravings unless you enjoy dried out and rubbery food (both breakfast & dinner) for $30 a person.    I learned a lot from staying here. Having not experiencing these problems in other MGM hotels I was surprised by the misinformation we received along with rude or poorly trained personnel. Hospitality is hard work I get it. But there is no excuse for the service we received during our stay. It's a beautiful hotel but not for us. We will never stay here again."
50,I love The Mirage. It has a south seas tropical vibe one of the best pools in all of Vegas and great dining options for most every budget.    There are multiple room types with various price points. Resort is located near The Venetian Treasure Island Caesars Palace and The Linq. Close attractions include The High Roller and Fashion Show Mall. The Las Vegas Monorail while a bit of a walk across the street and through Harrahs to the station can get you further down the Strip.    The volcano erupts only a few times nightly at the top of each hour. Get there 5-10 minutes ahead of time then head on with your evening.
40,The casino and dining were worth the cost but the rooms weren’t. Their Post Modern Jukebox show was so much fun and a must see! If you go to bed early don’t get a room on the same side as the volcano show. But seriously you’re in Vegas why are you going to bed early?!
20,The check-in process was excruciatingly slow. My reserved room was not available. The shower was so small that you couldn't move to thoroughly clean. The view was very disappointing. The cost of EVERYTHING was excessive.
50,The best place to stay for our girl's trip. From the flight to the shuttles and every thing and place around the hotel was the bomb. Most definitely will be visiting Las Vegas and the Mirage again in the near future
50,I highly recommend staying at the Mirage. The staff from check in to playing to check out were top notch. Great selection of slots and table games. M Life rewards and services were one of the best I’ve had.
40,Great location. First time in Vegas family of 3 with 16 year old.    The guy in the fitness centre wins the staff member award from me. He works relentlessly to ensure that gym works like clockwork & keeps it immaculate.    Front desk & concierge need a little more attention to their customer service skills! I wish I’d known about mobile check-in before arrival.    The pool area is beautiful but needs 30% of the sun beds removing to make it feel more tranquil- it’s far too packed & lying too close to strangers isn’t pleasant.    Overall a great location- but didn’t have the ‘elegance’ of Caesar’s or Venetian I was expecting.
50,This hotel is in a great location. Service was good. The room was very clean and comfortable. Our request were met with speed and accuracy the cleaning staff were very friendly. I'm a nut for cleanliness as I work in hospitality and the room we had was very well maintained. Koodos to your housekeeping Dept. We will be back
50,This hotel is very nice. The casino is nice. It’s not huge which makes it easier to find people that you are with. The rooms are bigger than other hotels in Vegas that I’ve stayed at. The staff is quite friendly. The Oasis pool is nice as the main pool is very crowded. A great stay for me.
50,Second time staying at the Mirage. Centrally located and beautifully maintained hotel. Excellent eateries very nice casino great staff helpful dealers. Terry Fatour was excellent. See his show. Love the volcano demonstration in the evening.
30,The mirage has a good center strip location but it is not what it once was. The rooms are showing signs of age and degradation. The service is no longer first in class. We waited 45 minutes for a valet to bring our car. Housekeeping failed to show up one day. The pipes vibrated in the wall unless we left the sink running. There were spider webs on the wall. The fixtures in the sink are showing corrosion the carpets and décor are out of date.
50,We just wanted to get away from the earthquake and Las Vegas was the destination. I would definitely recommend the Mirage. The staff is really nice and are happy to accommodate your stay to the fullest.
30,"Entire first floor is too loud. The air-conditioning is set way to cold.  The options for dining are too limited.  The overall architecture and furnishings are beautiful. The ""Sleep Well"" room option is well worth the small additional cost."
40,Overall on a scale from 1-10 the Mirage is a 9 !!! If the rooms &suites would be updated they works be a 12 !!  Location - Staff - Services - Pool area - Libby very inviting - The in-house residency boys to men was absolutely amazing
40,I loved this hotel and would definitely recommend it as the perfect base for exploring every hotspot Vegas has to offer.    I picked this hotel as I wanted to experience the original glamour of Las Vegas and as one of the first resorts on the strip this hotel didn't disappoint!    The decor has a tropical Polynesian vibe. The pools are large and surrounded by waterfalls which was really cool. The casino is lovely and the rooms are spacious clean with modern facilities!    The restaurants were brilliant but I think my favourite has to be Osteria Costa - amazing pasta and homemade pizza! The limoncello wasn't bad either!    I was a little disappointed with the Beatles show currently being shown in the hotel but I think that has more to do with the fact I'm not that keen on that type of music.    Great hotel with relaxed vibe!
40,Very enjoyable stay at the Mirage. Room was very spacious clean quiet and had everything needed. Excellent air con very much needed in the July heat. WiFi good. The bathroom wasn’t as small as expected in the basic rooms perhaps it helped being European! Staff were very helpful and we enjoyed the casino pool shops volcano show and secret garden.    Perhaps a bit more tired looking around the edges than some of the newer hotels but this was reflected in the cost. We did feel the drinks and restaurants were generally expensive but this was Vegas overall and not helped by the dire £ exchange rate. Pool very busy but was still possible to find a couple of loungers at anytime of the day after a search - just be prepared to be very close to fellow guests. Buffet breakfast also very good but almost doubled in price at the weekend which seemed excessive.
50,Very relaxing everyone was friendly. Very centrally located..comfort food across the street..tad cheaper than hotel prices if you don't want to pay that...the food was amazing at the burger place in hotel..
50,We have recently stayed at the Mirage with two young children and had a fantastic time. We checked in (& out) online which took all of a couple of minutes and meant our room and card was available almost immediately on arrival. We had a volcano room on the 23rd floor which was perfect and meant we could see the volcano each night which was a highlight for our oldest son. The pool was a huge hit we found everyone to be friendly and always found a lounger whatever time we went. We ate in the hotel for breakfast and supper each day with loads of choices of restaurants! Thank you for such a super stay we’ll be back.
50,This was my fourth trip to Vegas and second time staying at The Mirage. As I have written before it is my favorite. I state this because of the location restaurants and variety of entertainment. The location is basically in the middle of the strip with Caesars Palace on one side and Treasure Island on the other across the street is a Walgreen's Denny's White Castle and I think a McDonald's. Although I didn't work out while I was there they have a very nice gym. My friend who shared the room with me is a gym rat she said it was nice so I went and I took a peek at it. That was as close as I got. The buffet is okay but Osteria Costa was very nice. I love pasta and found the dishes to be seasoned just right and not over the top with too much of one seasoning to stick out over the others. California Pizza Kitchen is always good for a quick bite and so is the Pantry. The Pantry is open 24 hours and offer a variety of good food. I love the bar that is centrally located because of the sofas surrounding it and the nice staff. There are plenty of other bars but I never seem to go to those. There is one that at a certain time gets pretty loud and everyone seems to be having a good time because maybe there's a dance floor and a DJ. So if you are looking for a party that may be the one for you. Just listen for the music and people getting loud and you'll find it. This is my second review for The Mirage and I still am able to give it 5 stars after two years between stays. I was looking for the Brazilian restaurant that was there two years ago but I guess it must have changed into another restaurant because of how much meat they served and not as many people are eating meat like they once were. Again please remember the resort fees if you did not book with The Mirage directly these fees will be added to your account. There are other fees they hold for damage but they will release them once your room is cleared. Although I did not book with them directly they were able to help me get two beds instead of one. I forgot to change that before I got there. Love The Mirage!
50,Stayed in a 2 bedroom suite this year after years of staying the 1 bedroom suite and the room was just a great. Decor is very modern and the rooms are very clean with daily maid service. Customer service is great.
50,We stayed here for an enjoyable 7 nights at the start of July. Check in was swift and simple all 3 of us had separate rooms on the same floor which was good. Rooms clean and spacious and bathroom adequate for what it’s needed for. Casino itself had a good vibe and the bars were great. Only downside was the sun loungers at the pool. If you are not down when first open these go very quick and stay unused with people placing towels on them for hours before they come back to use them. I would defo stay here again but wouldn’t try the pool area.
50,First time staying at the mirage and it was a great experience. Staff was helpful in answering questions pool is awesome and the restaurants were spot on. I recommend the paradise cafe. Its pool side and has excellent food.
40,Great resort! We really enjoyed our stay there. Rooms were beautiful!! Loved our view of the mountains!! Restaurants were great!!! Wish there was a soaker/jacuzzi tub and a mini fridge. Perfect location right in the middle of the strip!!
10,Old hotel. Which is fine. When woken up at 7 AM to saws and construction on the floor above the front desk staff said this is an old building so these things happen. No apologies no compensation nothing. We also did not have water for two hours one morning. Again staff told me it’s an old hotel and things like this happen. Very disappointed. Two of my five nights were not pleasant at all! When brought to the staffs attention they looked at us and talk to us like we were stupid
30,Beautiful resort. Please put more money into your rooms. We could hear everything next door and in the hallway. Also mini bar snacks by weight is not good idea since it could easily be knocked over and charged to the room.
50,Great amenities to price. Staff extremely helpful and respectful. Pool was large enough for amount of people there. Lots of restaurant options in the resort. Casino was large and clean. Will stay here again.
10,Check in person was rude told me I wasn’t a pearl member so couldn’t check in at a certain line I was upgraded after an hour of play.    The fire alarm also went off at 5am for our entire floor so I was unable to sleep after that.
30,We stayed at the Mirage hotel and casino for 4 nights as a long weekend get away.    The stay was just ok. Nothing spectacular.    The casino was as expected and we had fun the pool was great and all the staff we encountered were friendly but there were a few things about our trip that would make me rethink another stay.    Firstly the room was clean and the layout was as I expected except the worn cloth headboard that was hidden by pillows. The fake leather had peeled off in several places and needs to be updated.    We upgraded to a “strip view” room. Well they didn’t actually lie about the strip view but I feel it was a little misleading. The strip could be seen off in the distance in the background of the fantastic view of the rooftops.    We have vacationed in Vegas many times over the last 15 years and are always amazed by how many families with young children we see. The Mirage however seemed to have way more kids than any other property We have stayed at.    The room we were given had an adjoining door to the room next to ours and when we returned on our first night all we could hear was a baby crying next door. Then we were woken up at 7:00 in the morning to the same baby and it’s siblings.    I know that’s probably a bad coincidence but when I go on vacation to what is typically considered an adult area and leave my kids at home I don’t really expect to still be woken up early (after a late night out) by someone else’s kids.    The restaurants were full of screaming kids and on our last morning we witnessed a large dog pooping on the carpet going through the casino.    It wasn’t all bad though.    The staff at the pool area and bartenders at the pool and Dolphin bar were fantastic. The housekeeping was great and the “post modern music” show was really good.    I think next time though we will spend a little more and stay at a different property.
50,The Mirage is our go-to resort/casino. The staff is great the rooms are spacious clean and newly updated. There are many options for food entertainment and shopping and the gambling floor has many options but is not huge. The location on the strip is perfect!
50,This was our first trip to Vegas and we had a great experience. Check in was very smooth enough parking. Would highly recommend The Mirage great location and close to everything. Variety of restaurants inside hotel and shops also
40,The Mirage seems to gear toward the family with the dolphin and tiger habitat the pool and being near Ceasar's Palace shopping. The rooms are clean and comfortable. There's a volcano that erupts several times a night for entertainment as well. The Spa is very nice - facials body wraps massages - all well worth the price.
40,Overall our stay was great. Hotel staff was very nice and professional all the way around. Rooms were clean and comfortable we stayed in the tower king. The restaurants we ate at in the hotel were very good. Osteria Costa The Still Stack and LVB burger. We were particularly fond of the Pantry for breakfast. The pool is beautiful and we enjoyed it very much. We didn’t make it to the Dolphins but our friends did and they enjoyed it. The only thing holding back my giving this an excellent rating is they didn’t apply my AAA discount as promised. We received an offer to upgrade our room to the tower king from a std king. It was a good offer so we took it. I called to verify and asked if the 10% AAA discount still applied since I couldn’t see it and I was told by “Shiera “ (not sure if I spelled that right) that yes it would. So check out and it’s not on there had to hurry out since my original flight was canceled now leaving earlier. Hopefully I can address it when I land we will see. I will update this when I do.
40,This was my first stay. The room was nice I just wished they offered a microwave or even a mini fridge. Not everyone can afford the things out of the mini bar like a 18 dollar water. Also the M-life rewards system was not explained to me regarding the free play or how long it took to get any type of reward.
30,We booked Hotel for family vacation and we did not get the room we reserved at check in we even gave deposit to hold the queen double bed room but received handicap king bed room overlooking the back roof of the hotel .Check in person just said sorry best we have for tonight .
50,First time staying at the Mirage and I definitely would love to come back. Not at all difficult to navigate getting around the hotel once you know where everything is. Hotel pool area was very nice and clean. Had a great time at sitting at the dolphin bar!
40,A good mid level casino in busy part of strip. Rooms need a little bit of TLC. Bar games are set up to make you think you have to play max coins when you start. If your new to video poker it can take you a while to figure out you can bet less. They have plenty of $10 table games. Pool is nice with a lot of greenery and shade but will get very crowded. Fun poker room with good humored players and low stakes.
50,While at the Mirage my wife took a fall as a result of me clipping her foot with the electric mobility scooter I was riding. Many people from Security were involved in assisting us in obtaining medical assistance. I was taken to the ambulance in a wheelchair (I am an above knee amputee) but was unable to get into the ambulance cab. As a result the Security people took me to the front of the hotel where I caught a cab. When my wife and I returned to the Mirage after spending the night in an Emergency Room a Security person met our cab and took my wife to our room in a wheelchair. When I called the front desk to inquire if we could extend our visit another night (I didn't want to make the drive back to Tucson without any sleep since the previous night) I learned that it had already been done This was especially important as I require a handicap accessible room. In all the Mirage personnel did their best to help us get through this difficult situation.
40,The stay was fine but the wait to check in and check out was like waiting on lines at Disney. You can use the kiosk but I worn you that may not be as easy as it looks. Rooms were clean. Restaurants were expensive. Staff was friendly.
50,The Sorg Family love coming to Las Vegas. We have stayed and many different casinos this is our second time staying at the Mirage and it was amazing. The customer service was top-notch they went above and beyond. Cabanas at the pool were amazing rented it for two days the best time. Our son Tristan was turning 21 and he wanted to stay at the mirage the concierge got him VIP access to clubs and bars and it was amazing it was one of the best biggest experiences I’ve ever had and I go to Vegas at least several times a year. Mandalay Bay is normally my home when I go to Las Vegas but Mirage definitely stepped up their game. The rooms were awesome the grounds were amazing the pool was amazing Customer Service 10+ All of us highly recommend the Mirage
50,The rooms are spacious and clean. Housekeeping is very prompt accommodating and professional. If and when I visit Las Vegas again I would be staying at this hotel. If I didn’t have to go outside I would not have. I found everything within this hotel dining gambling shoes pool etc.
10,I would love to give the Mirage a great review the hotel is nice staff is nice rooms are nice BUT the resort fee is ridiculous. Im not sure what we got for our $320 resort fee after we already paid for a room. This fee is not clearly defined upfront and is a very unpleasant surprise. Be careful when you price hotels as this fee is not included in the room rate. Our reasonable stay quickly added up with this resort fee added in at check out.
10,Don’t stay here unless you have travel insurance our flight kept getting canceled and we ended up missing 4 days of our trip and we’re told since we didn’t book directly through the mirage (who does?) there was nothing they could do for us. We called at least 3 times updating them about our flight issues in fear they would cancel our reservation and were told they would hold it however when we arrived to check in they did in fact cancel us and the front desk was extremely rude about it. We had to change rooms because our toilet wouldn’t flush even with out anything in it to clog it only to get to another room with the same issue. Also unless you want to go to a sit down restaurant breakfast lunch and dinner this place isn’t got you. We had to go out and walk to different hotels just to grab a quick bite. And lastly if you care about the well being of animals at all you wouldn’t want to stay somewhere that supports and promotes the poor dolphins in the minuscule pool they call a habitat
50,Stayed here for 5 nights with my two friends when we arrived check in was quick and easy we heard about the 20 dollar tip trick we put 20 dollars in a passport and we got upgraded to a suite room on the 29th floor with a pool/strip view. It was amazing    The room was spotless it had 2 double beds walk in shower separate tub and his and hers sinks.    Location is great right in the middle of the strip there is a McDonald’s across the road  we ended up there a few times on the way home from a nightclub so was very handy for us.    I would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Vegas & I will certainly be coming back myself.
50,Beautiful hotel and pool friendly staff and a great buffet. Very relaxing stay for my wife and I. The bed was very comfortable and the pool and pool area are simply stunning and the whole facility was kept very clean.
40,One of many supersized hotels and casinos on the strip with nothing to make it stand out from the crowd! Rooms were a good size and well maintained. Staff were friendly and there was nothing to complain about.  I do however feel the resort fees are excessive ($37 plus tax) as we didn't use any of the included facilities (pool spa gym) and the internet service was very poor so didn't even make use of that!  Would recommend as a central base for visiting Las Vegas but maybe next time I would stay off strip and save money instead of paying for services you don't need!
40,The best part of The Mirage is it's location. Right in the middle of the strip in amongst all the action.  We had no complaints during our 3 night stay here although there wasn't anything particularly great about it either.  The queue at check-in was long but it moved quickly. The check-in process was friendly helpful and efficient.  The bedroom was clean and well decorated and reasonably modern. Free wifi was very good and there were plenty of power sockets and usb charging points in the room.    The casino was ok the café was ok the bar was ok. We didn't use the pool or ear a main meal here so can't feed back on those.    I would recommend the hotel as a mid-priced option. No complaints for anything and the location was great. As a mid-priced option I would say that Paris is the most likely contender for this place although haven't seen those rooms. Alternatively if your budget can stretch a bit more I would go to The Venitian - a fantastic hotel.
30,Got sick twice from the banquet food had to change our room due to poor clean up on construction only thing good was location. The food was average the staff were very busy but worked to resolve our issue. In terms of customer service they were great. I will not be reccomending the Mirage unfortunately.
40,Good location but rooms getting dated If you have an early flight just know u can’t get into a room before 3 pm!!!! Casino is nice but didn’t see any slot machines hitting and we like to play slots!!! Machines seem so tight
50,Stayed for the world series of poker and had our little one with us. So much for her to do there that we barely left. The volcano show is amazing! Looked at tigers and fed some dolphins. Has a variety if restaurants.
40,Good time and great staff food was very good as well as over all service. play floor was kept very clean and was not smoky although is was allowed to my dismay. The hotel made special arrangement to provide a fridge to keep our medication cool for us. All and all a great job!!
50,Very good customer service look forward to visiting in the near future. For anyone visiting please stay at the Mirage and there volcano exhibit was marvelous . The only thing I disagreed with was after the earthquake they did not check on the guest. Some have experienced it before and others have not.
40,Over all the room and view was great. Only issue I had was the sink dripping all day and the shower being so powerful it was hard to shower.    We did the 3 for 57 and loved the dolphins! Frozen yogurt downstairs was great!
50,We had the most amazing stay at the Mirage in July 2019. My family and I will only stay at the Mirage from now on. Everything about this hotel was perfect from the staff to the pool to the location on the strip. We can't wait to plan another trip to Vegas!
40,Our stay was great. The staff was friendly. Need more cocktail waitresses available in the slot machine areas. Kurt in the bar was a real gem! Very personable. Add Circus Circus to MLife points as we were told that they were part of MGM. Mandalay Bay was great also. Spent the day there in a Cabana.
40,Have stayed here repeatedly. The rooms are always nice and the the casino and restaurants are always being upgraded. Other hotels show their age over time. The rooms are always in perfect condition and are exceptionally clean. The Casino is lots of fun and has many tables with lower limits in respect for those of us that don't have monster gambling budgets. The pool is fantastic since it is chilled and large. Since coming here I have never been dissappointed
50,Staff was friendly and accommodating. Food options were great. Paradise Cafe was phenomenal. Overall a great experience. We spent our wedding weekend here. Location was perfect able to walk to most attractions.
40,Overall very nice. Have stayed here before and have always loved the Mirage. The breakfast place is the best. The shops could be better but the bars and restaurants are top notch. The Casino could be a little better ventilated.
50,We stayed at this hotel from 2nd - 6th July.  Hotel was centrally located on the strip & easy access to everything.  Was a beautiful hotel & more modern than some of the other hotels within the vicinity.  Would highly recommend this hotel for comfort & convenience.  We Got a takeaway from the burger restaurant to take back to the room this was very nice! Also went to Starbucks each morning which was always rammed but they all are tbf.  We stayed on the 15th floor & had an amazing room of the strip. Room was very clean & bed was very comfortable.  Staff helpful & approachable.
30,"It's my first night. I can't get to sleep. The room is pulsating with a loud band. Drums bass whatever getting inside. I know it's Vegas. But I requested a quiet room. Soooo...the front desk read me the boiler plate ""We can't guarantee...."" I cut her off. I explained that her own corporate had chosen the room. Then she said ""Well there is an event in The Still on Friday nights."" Ah so she knew that there was a band and everyone knows it can be heard even on the top floor of the hotel. Not right. Also the Carnegie Deli is awful. My sandwich sat alone on the counter. I had to get up and ask the cashier for help. I asked a server and pointed at the sandwich. There was nobody else waiting for food! The meat was overcooked greasy and full of fat. I know the original Carnegie and this wasn't remotely close. I want to like this place but I hate being mislead when it comes to well-being which includes sleep. Yes again I know it's Vegas but Midnight is not a reasonable time to be kept awake. Also staff doesn't know much about the hotel. I asked three people for a video poker bar. The funniest answer was ""All the bars have video poker."" Turns out there might be two perhaps a third but nobody knew where it was. For sure I was told for tomorrow since the lobby bar had the machines that the Sports Bar has them."
50,We have been loyal Mirage guests for almost 12 years now but last year we were forced to stay at another MGM resort for our annual visit. It was good. No complaints but we were SO happy to be back at the Mirage this year. The pool the Pantry The Still the buffet.... all as we remembered. Incredible. Treat yourself to the service the comfortable pillow top beds the food and the nightlife. We will never stray again Mirage. We promise.
40,This MGM property is good for both a business requirement like conventions and expos as well as for a couples getaway. The convention area is not so easy to access from the rest of the hotel venues But it is an excellent convention venue.  I believe the hotel could consider 1 or 2 additional restuarants.  Don't miss the pools or the show LOVE.
40,My niece from PA brought her two children to come visit me in Henderson. She & her husband stayed at my apt while I kept the kids overnight at the Mirage. The man who checked us in upgraded us to a renovated room overlooking the volcano which sent the kids into space!
40,We stayed at the Mirage specifically to attend a dance competition that was being held there. Going back and forth to the convention center was straightforward easy and convenient. (Compared to the MGM going to the convention center was a hike) Passageways were clean and ample to support large crowds of people moving about. In general everything was nice and clean. Thank you!
40,Over all the comfortable home in the oasis of activity. We felt we made it home every return to the hotel. Nice to be saying the room and pools and casino and restaurants were pleasant places. This is the strip in Las Vegas!
40,Great time rooms clean and had plenty of room to move around . Staff very friendly. Location was the best middle of everything. Best was easy check in and express check out through TV with no problems.
40,While some aspects of the Mirage are starting to show its age it remains a great value hotel in a great location.  All staff that we spoke to were very friendly and helpful the hotel was clean the bed was comfortable and the pool was great.  The casino (and selection of games) is smaller than many of the competitors but it is still a good choice.  We were disappointed with Cravings buffet as we felt that it was not as consistently good as it used to be both in selections and quality. The Carnegie deli was excellent however and we would highly recommend it!  The greatest advantage to the Mirage is its prime location a stones throw from Caesar’s Venetian Treasure island and the fashion show mall.  Now that MGM has refurbished/rebranded the Monte Carlo into the new Park MGM I wouldn’t be surprised if the Mirage was next in line for a refresh as some areas are looking tired and dated.
10,Nasty outdated rooms. Loud ac systems. Broken and/or improperly operating key systems for elevator . Poor service from staff. Broken drawers. Hard to reach power near bed. Room smelled of smoke. Hallways reeked of marajuana.
10,I am not good at narratives and frankly rarely provide these reviews but this one deserves it in my mind. I stayed at the Mirage over the last few days for a convention that cost me a great deal of money. I was not prepared for being charged $113 to tape down an extension cord and then $52 more for them to remove that piece of tape. I was not thrilled about paying $37 a day for a 'resort fee' that is really nothing more than wireless service throughout the property. I was not prepared to throw out my special dietary food because the only refrigeration in the room is for THEIR items and if you remove one you get charged some ridiculous price... $18 for a large Smart Water? The same one you get for $2.99 in any store. Food choices in the restaurants while appealing were so overpriced we left the property to find better choices. The Mirage is no different than any other property on the Strip and all they all do is strip you of any money you had left when you arrived. I already through out the M life cards we got since I am never going back. This was a business trip and not a vacation. It really left me with a bad taste. Things have changed a great deal in Vegas over the years. I hate coming here and this is a good reason why.
20,"We made reservations for a king room upon arrival we were told that one was not available. When we said we would not take a queen room the reception employee went back and ""found"" a king room for us. We went to the room opened the door and discovered suitcases and shopping bags. Immediately we went back to reception and they again tried to put us in a queen room. Again we told them no and they ""found"" a king room for us. We requested a manager and she gave us two nights of resort fees back. The bed was not comfortable and the room never really cooled down lower than 70 degrees which is too warm for sleeping."
50,Me and my wife have stayed there four times we love it every time we go unlike other casinos there's no harassing by people trying to sell you something while your walking around the casino I would recommend the Mirage to anybody
30,We do an annual trip with a bunch of family and friends. Our purpose is to leave the BS behind and have a great time. We make sure to hit one concert or show while in town but we also make time for amazing food.
50,"We finally got to stay at the Mirage. Everything was prefect. Pool area is a tropical island. The Craving""s buffet still so good. So nice to stay at a hotel with no problems. Every one working there doing there job. Nice customer service."
50,This hotel was beautiful and had every amenity that one would desire. The pool area and LOVE show were fantastic. The check in and poolside service were second to none. With a perfect location on the strip my overall experience was excellent!!
20,Expensive rooms and was not given a bathtub for a king room. No coffee maker in the room. Sunday buffet was ridiculously expensive for the price. The buffet food was bland.DO NOT PAY FOR THE POOL. IT IS A SCAM!!!!!
50,My friend and I had a blast staying at the Mirage and would happily stay again. This place was recommended to me by a family friend for the cleanliness and ease of access to restaurants which is apparently difficult in Vegas due to the high crowd volume. Also not only was this just a place to stay but they had a hug pool secret gardens with white tigers and dolphins and access to shows and an onsite club. The staff is super accommodating and we got great recommendations for our night from a woman at the front desk. Great trip and we won a few bucks at the tables and machines here which was an extra bonus.
10,I have been coming to The Mirage since 2007 and I never had any issues. During this most recent stay however the staff seemed very short tempered with me and my group. It was during the week of Independence Day so maybe the holiday crowd was a bit much for the staff and the team at the Mirage was overwhelmed.
50,If you want to stay in the center of the strip in a hotel that offers good value and a fantastic pool and outdoor bar then the Mirage is the place for you. Look Dave up in the outdoor Dolphin Bar. He's a great bartender and a fun guy who can tell you all about what's happening in Vegas.
50,Everything at the Mirage was great! The suite the food the pool and the customer service were fabulous. One young lady is the VIP Lounge was rude (small Asian I think) and not helpful warm or accommodating at all; but everyone else was great!
50,The staff was excellent friendly helpful very respectful did everything to make our family trip special.  The pools were amazing  Food and drink a bit pricey  Rooms were clean as were the casino  Hotel located right on strip which made it easy to get around to see the sights.
40,The mirage is a lovely hotel and close to everything. Check in took a bit longer and was waiting around but then was upgraded for the inconvenience. The room was really nice with a good view. The pool area was really good.  Some more variety of restaurants would be good.  Definitely recommend!
20,We chose Mirage because of the pool. During our stay on a day we wanted to be at the pool the adult only pool was closed. Very disappointing. The food choices were subpar. The room was not clean upon arrival.
20,"Booked a 2BR suite through the hotel after they said they could not guarantee adjoining rooms. My main purpose was to babysit my 9yo grandson so his parents could enjoy and I couldn't take a chance on the proximity of the rooms. Joined the M club to get what I thought was a good rate celebrating my 75th birthday (and for that my room card said Happy Birthday period!)  We arrived to checkin at 1:30pm and were told at desk it was a 'lovely room' but the clerk couldn't tell me what floor or which view. Gave us key cards to be valid when room was ready. ""It's a very big room and takes a long time to clean"" Advised to check back at 3:30 if they had not called my cell. By then there was a very long line and there had been no place to sit and just put my feet up and my grandson could not go the casino we had many bags (as it was the first stop of a longer trip) Never saw a hotel rep in the lobby area that was not behind a desk. Only seat I found was outside bathroom shared with 2 employees. People were sitting on the floor changing clothes in the area and it smelled strongly of smoke. Really no lounge area for what seems to be a common problem at the Mirage rooms not ready~  Finally called Mclub and they said our room was ready and gave me the # on the 25th floor in the tower building. Funny thing but the tower elevator was for 26-30 floors so we wandered around looking for someone to ask couldn't find anyone. The phone nos. I had were busy...we went to the A floor but there was no housekeeping cart to ask for directions. Back to the lobby now key card wouldn't take us up...finally rode up with others got off at B and a housekeeper said the 25th floor was actually the A floor (duh was I sposed to know that?) We were of course at the end of the corridor and when we went in at 4:15 the masterbedroom and LR were ready but we couldn't find the other bedroom SURPRISE! it was adjoining and not been cleaned. After 20 min it was .'done' but I guess that didn't include dusting or thorough vacuuming. It was a pitifully small room and tiny bath. No towel hooks for bath towels no grab bar and not rubber tub mat. Padded headboard and LR furniture had tears screens dirty and spoiled the view of the many rooftops and not much else. So this was our 'lovely room' If I had the energy I would have pitched a fit but I was so exhausted I had to rest up for the trek down to the elevator to have dinner. Master bedroom was musty smelling and the doors did not prevent noise from coming in door stop was never delivered so we had to keep chairs against the door between my bedroom and the living room.  So Mirage I have thrown my Mcard away enjoyed Hoover Dam much more than your hotel and will definitely not recommend it to anyone. Instead of a suite we could have 2 connecting rooms for half the price....but why would you provide good customer service for a special request for my birthday!"
20,I did ALOT of research and was so disappointed in our stay. :(  Although at first review of the hotel it appeared nice the room really left so much to be desired. Outlets didn't work curtins torn mold on the ceiling too much to list. :(  I would choose another property.
20,After booking a month prior to our trip and paying $40 for guaranteed 11am check-in we arrived at 7am and weren’t assigned a room until almost 1pm. We had our luggage dropped off at 7am and waited 3 hours once in our room for it to be brought up. We called the desk and were told they didn’t have our luggage. I had to go down to the desk and show my ticket and wait an additional 15-20 minutes there to receive my luggage. Room service also knocked and opened our door while our privacy sign was hanging.
40,Mirage brig money to play and money to drink outrageous on drinks at the Mirage but overall good facility. Close to the whole proximity of the strip. Great pool awesome rooms. Stay with couples or friends best place to stay.
40,I love the Mirage. I did not have much luck on the machines this trip but I always enjoy my stay. The location is central and you can access many of the strip attractions from the Mirage. Will stay again.
50,I will definitely book another vacation here.. just make sure at check-in that you definitely have a strip view if that is what you paid for. Other than that my family and I really enjoyed ourselves.
20,We did not pay for chairs at the pool and all chairs were full and crammed all together with no table for drinks. It was 111 degrees and hot and pool water was way too cold. Pool area should havfe had someone cleaning around the chairs. Could barely walk between the sets of lounge chairs. Rooms need updating. Restaurant by the pool area inside the hotel had 2 people working and the lady taking the order had to also get the items ordered. Need more employees.
10,I’ve never been so disappointed in a hotel . The mirage really let me down . This was supposed to be a fun vacation and celebration of parents anniversary but the staff ruined it by their attitudes and lack of customer service. They did absolutely minimal to show that they care about their guests and use excuses like “we had call outs “ so that’s why we’re getting the orders wrong . The rooms are dated and the suite we stayed in had knicked furniture and ripped wallpaper and broken outlets!! They obviously don’t care or management just gave up on caring and it shows. I wouldn’t recommend this hotel unless you absolutely have to stay for a convention or work and even then anywhere else in Las Vegas would be better than this hotel. Unfriendly staff and age discriminated.
30,The Mirage is in a great location in the middle of the Strip but the rooms have seen better days. While there were no glaring issues the guest room I stayed in looked worn and ready for a remodel hope they renovate soon. Also the bathroom was smaller than other nearby hotels I've stayed in (TI Flamingo Planet Hollywood MGM NYNY) but the room was large though the furniture was older. I've wanted to try out the Mirage for a while but now that I have I'll wait to come back until after I hear about a renovation.
40,"Decided to go to the Mirage for this trip to Las Vegas as it wasn't supposed to break 100 degrees that day and we really love the pool deck at the Mirage with all the shade and waterfalls etc. Decided to try one of the ""stay well"" rooms this time and really loved it with the aroma therapy special lighting etc. I could go on and on about the amenities of the different hotels but have done that before so I'll save that this time. I had a very pleasant experience in the casino as I left with some of their money instead of making a donation this time. The Beatles Love like all of the of the other ""Cirque du Soleil"" shows is amazing (second time seeing this one. I hear a lot of complaining about the pricing of the food at the restaurants and all i can say is welcome to Las Vegas. ;o) - There are different places to eat within each resort. The Pantry is a moderately priced place to get a great breakfast as well as other meals being 24 hour. The LVB burger place is great if monster burgers are what you want. Overall this resort is great. If you want just basic food with just that"
20,Long lines at check in and m life. Slot machines are tight. Rooms are becoming dated. Dining choices are limited at mirage. Be careful with the slot denominations on newer machines. It’s difficult to figure out what is max credit. Machine was on ten cent vs a penny and spin was 57 dollars vs 5.70. Slot machines are tight. I’ve stayed at mirage over ten times. See a big decline in the facility from Our last two visits.
10,Unfriendly unmotivated staff. Issues took days to resolve. Broken fridges doors outlets... All took several days and and multiple follow up phone calls to get resolved. Staff motivation to solve issues was non existant. Management stated that he could not control the other guest smoking in the halls of the non smoking hotel.
40,Excellent stay was there for birthday anniversary and dance competition only downfall was the exuberant prices at all restaurants during the July 4th holiday otherwise great service! Pool was clean..... and housekeeping was great!
10,room was very small old smelled musty moldy toilet didn't always flush. Commode was so low it felt like it was designed for a child and if you were sitting on the stool you couldn't open or close the bathroom door the view window looked like something with sibstance to it was thrown at the window overall it was the worst hotel room I have ever had
40,Great service. The buffet could have had better food. More sushi and icecream not no fat yogurt. The housekeeping staff was very friendly and did a great job of cleaning the room. The casino was very good easy to find machines I liked
50,Great hotel loved the environment. Lots to do single or with families we loved the dolphins and other animals. The pool was fun. The room was great! It was easy to navigate the hotel and there wasn't a strong smoke smell in the casino like there is at others.
50,The stay well double queen rooms were a perfect fit for families of 4 people. great late night food at the Pantry. very nice array of slot machines. friendly staff at the MLife rewards desk was able to print me out a new copy of my rewards card in no time.
20,Guest rooms were average. The Cravings buffet was completely self-service. We had to get our own food (which is normal for a buffet) but our own drinks as well. I might as well bus my own table.The food selection was minimal and not of a very high quality. The large dessert area had nothing but cookies & some kind of cake bars nothing else...no pies no cakes no puddings cobblers. Will not eat there again.
50,We stayed for one week. We upgraded to to tower king room for 30 dollars a night and it was wonderful. 24th floor with a view of the pool dolphin pool and the strip. Very quiet in the room great black out curtains and a very comfortable bed. There is a resort fee to pay which is about 41 dollars per night but we knew about this before we came. Definitely get an m life card as you earn points from all the MGM resorts which may give you some discounts on your stay. We went to a number of shows. The Beatles love show is excellent. Definitely worth the money. We also saw Scott Bradlee's Post Modern Jukebox at the Mirage which was awesome. We ate at the buffet which was fairly good with plenty of choice and drinks included. Carnagie's deli was really good also. The casino was great too. The Mirage is located right in the middle of the strip. There is a bus service called the deuce that runs the length of the strip which stops at every major hotel and tourist attraction. It's 8 dollars a day or or 20 dollars for 3 days. It is worth it. Taxis are expensive. The taxi wanted 38 dollars from the airport but the Uber was 15 dollars. We found all of the staff to be friendly and helpful. The hotel was full due to 4th July holiday but the standards of the hotel remained high. There are nicer more modern hotels but I wouldn't stay anywhere else. We shall return.
50,Best hotel on or off the strip! Classy clean & simply wonderful! Not to mention centrally located to everything! The pool area is gorgeous the Poker room is well run & always busy. The restaurants are great! Simply an enjoyable stay! As always!
40,we Stayed in the queen room at the Mirage. The rooms were nice and clean but the bathroom is small and it’s tub and shower combination. The pool area was nice and we founds chais right away. The water was clean and I loved the water falls. I would recommend the buffet there. The were s variety of selections and tasty food. The hotel is overall nice but is getting outdated and needs a remodel.
50,Mirage was a great time. The whole experience was fabulous. The rooms are amazing. So peaceful and quiet. They are also very spacious.  The good is great. We ate just about every place with the hotel and every meal was delicious.  From the time you walk thru the front door everyone was very nice and pleasant.  The casino floor and choices were great
30,The stay was ok but the staff was not super friendly. Problems with the room key and was told to get back in the LONG check in line to get it resolved. No apologies when I did finally get it resolved. The A/C in the room wasn't great but it did finally cool off at night. The pool staff was fantastic though and the property is well kept.
40,"The Mirage is a great place to stay and has an ideal location on the Strip. The rooms are nice especially the Tower Suite which I feel is one of the best values compared to other hotel suites. The Mirage also has the benefit of having Carnegie Deli California Pizza Kitchen Pantry and The Still on property. Finally the good customer service makes The Mirage the ""complete package"" for a great vacation."
50,We travel a lot and want to try different hotels. Mirage was very nice. We ate at the buffet and was very pleased. Free bear and wine was nice. We also ate at the pantry which had great service and good breakfast. My husband got the wrong order but it was changed right away.
40,Great hotel I would stay here again. Bed was comfortable room was clean. Only issue was our shower head sprayed water everywhere & the washroom fan is very loud. Hotel is in a good location on the strip.
40,I went Vegas on a work trip. The hotel was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. My only regret was that I stayed on the second floor. The floor was very noisy and I had no view. I should have waited for room to come available on a higher floor. Overall my stay was good.
50,We go to the Mirage every July for our wedding anniversary. Everything was just like it has always been before. The pool was great. We will return again next July if not sooner on a separate occassion. We travel to Las Vegas about 3 times a year.
40,We stayed three nights in a King Tower Room. Everything about our stay was very good or excellent except we thought the dinner buffet at Cravings was just average.    The room was spacious the bathroom was a very good size and the bed was comfortable. Yes the furnishings could probably use a refresh but everything was clean and in working order.    The fitness room was one of the best I’ve seen in a hotel and the pool was outstanding. We had no trouble finding seats at the pool but a heads-up that almost all of the seats are in full sun.    The staff was very helpful and attentive. The dinner we had at Osteria Costa was excellent.    We saw two shows while we were there: Boyz II Men were very entertaining and a lot of fun and Love was just flat-out great.    It was our first-ever trip to Las Vegas but we will be back…and when we return we will stay at The Mirage!
50,Excellent stay military friendly hotel and all hotel employees were vey courteous. Best buffet in all of Las Vegas is in the Mirage. With the exception of the holiday increased pricing the hotel cost was well worth it.
40,We Love We Back Next. Year We Ready Reservation. We Dit Is A Placer Stay One Relax We Love It Was Good tIME To Relaxing Thanks See You On 2020. July Me And Family Enjoy We From California To Visit Las Vegas And Stay And Mirage Is A Placer
10,Despite having a confirmation for a king room check in tried to downgrade my wife and I to a room with 2 queens. Took 15 minutes of arguing to get it resolved. Room was dated had a hole in the wall tv was broken and we could hear everything from the hallway. Final bill had $70 of false charges that needed to be contested.
40,We really enjoyed the visit!    Rooms were very clean and air conditioning worked great! The hotel was constantly being cleaned by crew!    Restaurants were good as well! Large portions for price!    We loved the pool but you must get there early to get a good spot or a spot at all for that matter most chairs were saved but not being occupied!    Nighttime volcano show was pretty neat but fills up quick if you want a good view!    Overall I would stay here again great spot on the strip very central to everything and I would recommend others to stay here as well!
50,Great fun great room very clean and nice and roomy great location close to all the action on the Strip. Quick service at the front desk with no hassles. Casino needs a few new slot hames but still had fun!
40,The Mirage was a beautiful hotel in a perfect location on the strip. The main lobby looks like paradise. I would recommend booking a Staywell room. It was comfortable clean and just what we wanted. The pool was family and kid friendly. It was much more relaxing than the other hotels we have stayed at.
50,This was our 2nd visit in the last eight months. Came to Vegas for the Paul McCartney Concert and spent 5 great days at The Mirage!! No better place to stay! Staff is friendly and willing to do what it takes to make your stay special!
50,We always stay at the mirage . The rooms are great  the casino is clean and the staff helpful .  The hotel is close to all the nightlife on the strip . Did I mention the food there is excellent too ! Love staying here!
30,Good location good service shame hotel feels the need to attract customers via Dolphin's in captivity. Doesn't add to Hotel offering and for that reason I wouldn't use hotel again - this attraction is dated and unnecessary.
40,We recently visited Las Vegas and stayed at the Mirage. Kudos to them for waiving the resort fees on a comped room! That saves you about $40 a night. More money to gamble! Our view was of the volcano/strip. The volcano erupts at 8-9-10. Very cool. Room was clean and staff were polite and helpful. The pool was beautiful and very pleasant in the early morning hours.    Also Had one of the best burgers ever at their Carnegie restaurant. Warning be prepared to wait in a long line for coffee in the AM.
50,Great hotel and casino! The pool was refreshing but just to many kids. Other than that we had a great time! The food restaurants are great the casino was awesome. Very friendly environment. We would never choose a different Las Vegas location for our anniversary getaway.
20,Checked in at midnight. Room was assigned went to room and other guests were already in there. Did not feel safe after this problem. was there for a dance comp for my daughter. The new room assigned had a problem with the extra safety lock on the door and they NEVER fixed it the entire stay.
50,Would highly recommend this hotel. Friendly staff exceptional food- LVB Burgers has amazing burgers and milkshakes Cravings was a wonderful buffet- wide variety of food very fresh! Rooms are spacious very clean and extremely comfy beds. Location is great walking distance to so many other hotels pool was fantastic (just get there early to save your chair!) Only really downfall of the trip- but staff was easily accessible to assist us to find open lounge chairs)! Overall fantastic vacation and hotel!
40,The rooms are dated. The pool is very family-friendly and there is a private adult pool however we purchased a day bed precisely because we needed an umbrella for my grandbaby and because of wind the umbrellas had to be folded. They should be permanently cemented into the ground so wind would not be a problem.
40,Just noise from doors waking u up. Food a little expensive and pillows and beds very hard. Swimming pool hrs should be extended longer. At least till dusk more enjoyable. Plan to be in long line when checking in.
40,Checked in was easy  rooms were clean  greated daily by housekeeping with smile. I would go back but paying to park was incredibly ridiculous and i would not stay again when other place son the strip were offering FREE parking.
40,The room was comfortable to stay in however we could have used a room fridge which was only available at a cost. The pool area was great to relax in great for the kids and float rental was helpful. Dolphins experience was lots of fun for the kids as well as seeing some of the exotic animals.
20,Very surprised and disappointed over the quality of the food and service in the restaurants. Casino very dirty with overflowing ashtrays and empty bottle and glasses at slot machines. Overall very smokey in Casino.
30,"It starts with check-in. 45 minutes in a line with only 4 check-in staff working. This was at 3pm (offical check-in time) and after waiting for 45 minutes there was not a single King bedroom available. Supposedly there was a ""back up in housekeeping"". The Mirage clearly hasn't learnt that the faster you get guests checked- in the faster they can spend money in the Casino. It's a good location on the Strip and the bedrooms are pretty good - large and clean. The restaurants are 'okay' but not better than that. Given the quality eateries within walking distance (Wynn or Venetian) you shouldn't waste time at Mirage restaurants. Entertainment is very good. Staff at check-in and at restaurants were courteous but didn't seen excited to be working there. I won't come again."
50,This is a great hotel with a nice selection of restaurants. You can easily walk to many of the popular casinos. It is not so big that you get lost trying to find somone and the pool is one of the best on the strip! Some of the suites can use some updating and repairs.
50,Always good to stay at Mirage. Clean smells good staff always willing to help if needed. Really no complaints and this is my 4th time staying there. I would definitley reccomend it to anyone. Can't wait to go back
40,Stayed here June 2019. Rooms were spacious and clean. No coffee/tea making facilities so take your own! No fridge to use either if you open the fridge that they supply you have to pay and it’s fully stocked by them (very expensive!). If you want a fridge to hire from the hotel they charge $35 per night. We went to Walgreens across the road and bought a polystyrene cool box for $5.99 then kept it in the bath filled with ice from the ice machine at the hotel (one on every floor). Don’t leave it out on the side in the room as it will leak water everywhere.  The hotel is in a great location and the pool was great. Although it was very busy we always managed to find a sun bed. You could have as many complimentary pool towels as you wanted. The only issue was the brown edging around the pool had been painted and didn’t seem to dry for days. So be aware and use a towel to sit on if you want to dip your toes in!  We saw the Post Modern Jukebox show which was great the singers were all fantastic as was the tap dancer.  We had collected vouchers using the MyVEGAS app before we went so managed to get a couple of free buffets a couple of bogo buffets plus a few other bits and pieces. Well worth playing for a few weeks before you go and collecting rewards.  I went to the Secret Garden and was given a discount as I was staying at the hotel so it cost me $19 dollars instead of $22. Dolphins were great but wasn’t too impressed with the big cats. My friend paid $450 for a training day with the dolphins and was very disappointed as she only got 3 hours which included a very short swim with a dolphin in the pool and lunch was a cereal bar pack of Cheetos and a water. They seemed to be in very small enclosures for their size.  My biggest criticism is the hotel prices. The shop on site was much more expensive than Walgreens even with my Mlife discount. $4.50 for a small bottle of water! Ludicrous and pure greed. My husband is diabetic so we have to buy sugar free drinks and also in the heat we needed water to be available. The only restaurant we liked was The Pantry you could order room service too. The California Pizza Kitchen was overpriced and not good food Carnegie’s was also very pricey and undercooked not warm enough and the waitress was miserable.  I would definitely stay here again though mainly for the pool!
40,Easy breezy accommodations and service. Resort is just the right size to walk around and find what you are looking for. The double queen room 19056 faced the strip and had a great view. We also had a cot brought up which fit perfectly and room to move. There was plenty of drawer space for 3 women sharing the space. Whenever we called for something service was excellent. They came up in minutes. No disappointments here. Also there are several good restaurants and shows at this resort. We were very happy!
10,We stayed at the mirage for 6 nights and the experience was kinda disappointing. First of all there was a 30 minute line to check in when we arrived. Plus the wi-fi is literally a joke as they call it “high speed wi-fi” but it doesn’t work at all when you’re inside your room. The worst part for me was having a blood stained and mascara stained towel as a “clean” towel in our bathroom. Super disgusting!! The housekeeping service was bad as well. One time we left the room at the exact moment that the housekeeper arrived to clean it and when we came back hours after our room wasn’t cleaned!
40,my wife and i have come to the mirage at least 10 times over the past 20 years. we love it's location and love the pool. however we are not happy about the selection of restaurants(pantry) slots are ok but the ones that near carnegie are still in a poorly lighted area
50,We have stayed at the Mirage several times and find that we enjoy the hotel. We walk to Treasure Island and the Venetian and all the other hotels nearby. There are good restaurants within walking distance also. If we want to go to downtown we usually UBER it.
50,I like this place because it reminds me of the old Vegas experience. The staff cares and the gambling is professional and correct. Highly recommend this property to anyone visiting Vegas... Quality and price is a deal and a half!
10,Hotel and pool were nice. Beds were comfortable and clean. Drinks a bit pricey. Resort fee was higher than we were told. Pool could be bigger for number of guests. Bell service is irresponsible for luggage and shattered my laptop.
40,I stayed at the Mirage as part of a work conference and it was worth every penny. The view was amazing from my room the strip the water park were in view and within walking distance easily. The food at the hotel was kind of pricey but you could find very reasonably priced restaurants everywhere.
30,I stayed at the Mirage hotel for the first time in late June (MyVegas comp room) and it was just an OK experience. I was on the 23rd floor. Overall the room was good sized and clean. There was a fridge but it couldn't be used as it was filled with items for purchase. You have to use an ice bucket to keep bottled water cold. One big frustration I experienced was that I had to reach well behind the night stand to get to an outlet. There were additional outlets near the desk area on the other side of the room but that didn't help with my CPAP machine which needs to be plugged in by the bed at night. Some here have mentioned the small bathroom and it really is tiny-the door barely clears the toilet to close. Two people could not be in there at the same time. At night there was some kind of mechanical sound like a machine revving up that happened over and over again which was annoying. You could also hear doors slamming and people talking in the hallways. There was a large flat screen TV in the room but it never worked properly the entire time I was there--it skipped and stuttered and was unwatchable.  I think that overall this hotel is just average--its rooms less fancy than it appears. The biggest positive is the hotel location and the things it has to offer such as the Secret Garden LOVE show and special restaurants like the Carnegie Deli. I don't know if I would choose to stay here again unless it was another MyVegas comp. There are other hotels to choose from in the same area. Last note: do avoid the buffet as others have suggested. It has very little food variety and is pretty mediocre. Also the majority of the food I tried was not even hot.
50,I can not say enough about the staff and services that the Mirage has to offer. Everything from the Casino resturants and the staff it was all magnificent. We can hardly wait to go down again and enjoy everything the Mirage and staff have to offer.
40,Awesome location and checkout policies are really accommodating but rooms are a bit dated and they have no policy if an animal is injured on their premises. Found an injured bird and we spent $50 of our own money taking it to a vet. We were essentially told to let it die.  Kind of a downer for our honeymoon but overall really nice stay
40,Very nice stay. The only downside was we paid extra for a volcano view room and our room was in desperate need of a a redoo. The pleather headboard was all ripped up and they decided it was easier to cover up with pillows than actually replace headboard! Also bathroom was so small one person could barely squeeze in to shut the door so don't even think about getting ready at the same time as your spouse because that's not happening!! Lastly they stuffed a towel in the wall where ac was leaking. We were disappointed with our room since we paid extra
30,The hotel was ok. Our air conditioner did not work and our fan in the bathroom was so loud and rattled we could not use it. Also room service could not get our order right. Pool was nice. Probably would not stay again nothing special.
50,We had a great time. Service staff are excellent and there are two major shows right in hotel which are both excellent Terry favor and 'Love - Beatles show'.    The pool is proba by the best in Las Vegas?
50,«::A::» «::W::» «::E::» «::S::» «::O::» «::M::» «::E::»  Loved the restaurants and room rates were reasonable. We also received military discounts which we really appreciated. The dolphin show was amazing. Such a wonderful experience having the tour of the hotel.
40,It is a lovely hotel there was a number of us attending a Wedding in Vegas. Our room was great had a beautiful view of the strip but you pay for that. Our daughter overlooked the Secret Garden and she enjoyed here room also.
30,The hotel overall is nice. Rooms were clean and very nice. Restaurants and bars were pricey but that is to be expected. The pool was atrocious! It was very crowded and filthy. There were leaves and hair floating in the water. My son picked up a clump of hair while we were swimming. We swam around 1pm on a Monday and it felt like the pool had t been cleaned since the weekend. Really disappointing since we went for the pool.
50,"Checked in and got an upgrade to 24th floor( seperate elevator) strip view larger room!    Stayed for 4 nights and staff was great! From the check-in to the porters to the casino staff all treated us great! Used the ""M-life"" cards to play and charge food/drinks/merch to the room and upon check out recieved a $200 credit toward our bill as well as a free breakfast buffet for 2 on check out morning! Great place to stay clean and very quiet rooms!"
30,Pros: good price tower king rooms have private elevator service clean smoking is minimum.    Cons: location is at the end of the strip rooms need repairs restaurants are mediocre entertainment is minimal compared to other hotels.
50,Great weekend getaway . Stay well rooms were great. 40% off buffet for veterans and upto 3 other family was great and very much appreciated and I wish they extend that to all restaurants as food was very expensive every where . I believe it’s 10 percent off in other avenues. Customer service was pleasant and great everywhere. I recommend the Mirage.
20,Hotel feels old. Needs a significant refresh. Great location on the strip good shows but the locations feels like it is in an 80's time warp.That wouldn't be bad if it was fresh and clean not worn and tired.
40,Fairly central location on strip meant it was a good base for getting around.  Room decent size perhaps slightly ageing now and no plug socket near bed.  Pool area a good size with lots of beds.  Didn't try many of the restaurants there but would definitely recommend the pantry for breakfast as pancakes / brioche were delicious!
30,Been a long time customer there and I keep saying I'm done.    Pros: Middle of strip so great location dated but clean    Cons: Restaurant lines are always way TOO long check in experience is awful and longtime customers get NO early check in without an extra fee and same for check out. Mlife rewards over the years donated decent money and all I ever got to show for it was a free comp'd resort fee.    I'll be going to a different property in the future for the simple fact they don't take care of longtime and loyal customers. Every time I try and check in early they say they have NO rooms. it's like really not one room in this building??? Oh but for an upgrade fee there is availability. Mirage what about these free upgrades people post on here about??? I ask every time and it always comes at a cost! No thanks.
10,The food at the buffet was inedible except for the mashed potatoes. The Panrty had great soup! The catered breakfast and lunches we got for our confrence from the hotel were flavorless and bad. The rooms were okay nothing special. Had an issue finding outlet near the bed that were not stripped and hold my charger in. So I had an issue charging my devices. Which is a problem as many of us use them as alarm clocks these days. There was no location to actully complete work besides your hotel room. Which is not ideal at all.
50,Fabulous location right in the heart of the strip will definitely stay there again also great staff  l loved everything about this hotel also the staff were very attentive to nothing seem too much trouble . Hi
40,Had a good time here but hey watch out for the mini bar and snacks. Mini bar water; $17 ! Yes that's $17. JD in an airline size bottle $45. Not to mention that the offerings are weight sensitive. You bump them you own them. Note. You can get complimentary robes and slippers but you have to ask for them. Didn't go see the recycled zoo post Seigfried and Roy. Kind of pricey. Otherwise it was a nice place to stay.
50,The Mirage is one of the most beautifully maintained resorts on the strip. The rooms are always beautiful and clean the restaurants are great and having Beatles Love in-house is an added bonus. I've stayed here twice for business and absolutely recommend using mobile check-in. It allows you to get your room keys through a kiosk instead of waiting in line.
20,The room are starting to look dated . I had a leak in my room - There is a smell . The costs of a bottle of water is ridiculous . Location is probably the only thing going for them - They definitely need to upgrade. 1 Oak is great .
40,Checking in was easy. The room we occupied was on the 22nd floor and it had a good view of the surrounding hotels and the strip. The place is situated in the middle of the different hotel casinos that moving around from one place to another was easy and convenient. It was both an experience in terms of shopping and dining Likewise checking out was also easy and hassle free.
50,It's been awhile since my husband and I have stayed at an M life resort. However we returned for the weekend because (between UNLV graduation and EDC) hotel rates were abhorrently high and the Mirage prices were still relatively affordable. We opted for a Stay Well King as the wellness benefits of it intrigued us and we are SOUL happy we did!!! We especially LOVED that there was already a diffuser in the room so there was no need for me to have to pack my own = WINNING = more room in my suitcase! And that vitamin c infused shower head!!! Where can I get one to put in my own bathroom at home?! This is the FIRST. TIME. EVER. my skin did not get completely dried out while in Vegas and I didn't even have to apply body lotion! It was seriously FAN.TAS.TIC. I could literally feel the vitamin c nourishing my skin as I showered and the smell was absolutely divine. Being greeted by spa smells as you step off the elevator is also REALLY nice.    We very much enjoyed our stay... after long days out and about it FELT GOOD to return to our temporary home away from home. And if you like FEELING GOOD then do yourself a favor and book a Stay Well room at the Mirage! :o)
50,We had a great stay here for 2 nights. The room was good with a side view of the strip. The beds were very comfortable. The Pool area was large and well organised. The casino floor is large and the location is great for a stroll to other hotels on the strip.  My only point to note is that checking in was slow and didn’t seem that well organised.
50,We stayed for 7 nights and upgraded to a suite.  The suite was fantastic and the stay memorable. We attended 3 shows while we there and everyone was brilliant.  My wife never wanted to go Las Vegas as it wasn't on her bucket list But now she would go back tomorrow.    People friendly courteous and helpful.
40,I like the location of the Hotel right on the strip and in the middle. Nice rooms there is no smell and I love the pool. I also like the fact you are asked for your room key to access elevators to get to your room. The buffet is awesome good food.
10,Old dingy small rooms that are in desperate need of an upgrade.  Bare pool is run by a bunch of immature and unprofessional college bar bouncers that made my wife feel degraded and humiliated. A group of male service personnel that guarded the entrance to the Bare pool later came in and hung out by the bar They gawked and made inappropriate comments towards many of the female patrons. Could not believe the lack of professionalism displayed by these guys. The had egos the size of Manhattan and acted like they were a step above the clientele. Felt more like a cheap college bar then high class hang-out.    I travel to Vegas 3-4 times per year the past 20 years and this was by far my worst experience with a hotel and the services it offers.    Very disappointed.
50,Me and my wife stayed at the Mirage for her 40th birthday and we can’t fault a single thing. We upgraded to the strip view room on the 25th floor and the views were amazing. There is plenty of bars and restaurants in the hotel the location is brilliant we watched the Beatles Love show which shows in the hotel so you get up to 40% discount on the tickets when you show your room card. We also visited the Grand Canyon which is a MUST we got the tickets through a company called Sundance and we recommend them. Another must is the MOB museum in old Vegas followed with a night at Fremont street for a different experience to the Strip.  Use Uber’s for all your travel as they are cheap and turn up within 1-3 mins every time.
30,I had a recent stay at the Mirage between June 9-14. Overall the room was clean. They lost my luggage and didn't overnight it like they promised. I dont think I would have been so upset if it wasn't for the staff member I spoke with that following Monday who didn't seem to care. Lol. I cared! All my basic necessities were in that luggage like my daily allergy medications and my everyday makeup. Then I was told my feedback would go to a higher level of management but received no call-back. All in all I probably wouldn't stay here again and just take my chances at another hotel because there are a lot of choices on the Strip.
50,We had a great stay at The Mirage. The casino was clean didn’t smell like cigarettes as bad as other casinos.The hotel is in the percent location on the strip. We opted to upgrade to the Penthouse which we very highly recommend. It was fantastic! The Still has delicious French fry nachos. Great place to stay highly recommend.
40,We had a great trip for a work conference (CCW) at the Mirage in June. My husband joined me for fun and it was all around wonderful. From the lovely pool with multiple bars great food w/in the hotel from a variety of restaurants onsite and several coffee shops we literally never had to leave which was so nice considering I was on business but still had an opportunity to get some fun in and great food within the hotel. We will be back!
50,Rooms were clean food was fantastic and the staff was helpful. Can't ask for anything more than that! I was able to take a day at the end of my business trip and enjoy the pool and the dolphin/tiger exhibit. Very enjoyable.
50,This hotel is very beautiful. Great location. Great amenities inside and surrounding. Nice helpful and friendly staff. I love the Secret Garden Dolphin show and seeing the White tigers and lions. I enjoyed the pool area and the staff was very nice. My stay was amazing I highly recommend.
40,was great except no fridge in room .king room on strip no kettle no coffee or tea bags as an Australian was not used to this was 35 us dollars to hire the fridge and $15 for hot water for baby bottle because of no kettles .lots of hidden charges but room was beautiful staff was friendly. my family had 2 rooms 4 adults and a baby. i worked in hotels for 30 years in Australia never had 1 hotel without a fridge and kettle and tea coffee . this was very annoying and its hot i wanted to keep cool water in fridge we stayed 6 nights and we ate in the restaurants every night because of the baby we were out all day i loved it but need a fridge mini bars were locked so you could not use it for anything else this is bad Australians not used to it and the fridge you hire 70 US dollars for 2 rooms a night was ridiculous because of the staff and the clean room i give it a pass and would recommend the mirage but if your Australian be prepared for all the extra costs we went to a shopping center and bought a kettle saved us $ 15 each room for hot water
50,family and friends retreat. We were in various hotels. hadn't been at the Mirage in five years. Immediately notices the changes--live band more updated and modern slots numerous tables with a variable minimums. Rooms nice spacious. Just wished for a separate walk in shower. Will be visiting more often.
40,I stayed at the Mirage for my first trip to Vegas for a conference. The location was conveniently located on the strip within walking distance of shops and sightseeing. Several restaurant choices on site. The room was nothing fancy but adequate for my stay. The pool was beautiful and relaxing many lounge chairs to choose from. I loved visiting the Secret Garden but was disappointed I didn't receive the discount since I ordered online. Note you also get a discount for the Cravings buffet but have to ask for it. Check out was very inefficient only one desk staff working mid morning during busy check out time.
50,I love the Mirage Hotel and the Beatles LOVE show! They have very comfortable beds great food wonderful ambiance and a good casino experience. The buffet at Cravings is one of the best on the strip.
30,This was the 4th visit to Vegas. We stay at a different hotel everytime. The host ensured prior to arrival that the room would have full wheelchair access including in the bathroom. A walk in shower with a seat. The view from the room was looking at the side of Caesars Palace. The night before our departure home I tried to redeem my reward for $50 freeplay that I’d gained from playing the by Vegas games. This is the first time it’s been refused. Why? Because apparently I wasn’t a hotel guest!! I’d given my room number twice but was informed only one person registered in the room. So I couldn’t use my reward. So for that reason I couldn’t give 5 stars. In future ensure all guests are named on the room!! I’ve never been left off the room occupancy list at the other hotels we’ve stayed at.    Second year in a row that I’ve used yellow scooters to hire a powerchair for whilst I’m there. And again I can’t fault them. They’ve made my last 2 visits so easy. I tend to travel abroad with my manual wheelchair.
30,This is my 5th stay at The Mirage after giving up on the MGM several years ago because of the overcrowded pool with 30 somethings standing around wall-to-wall drinking. Time to start looking again. This time its because of the number of young kids everywhere. The pool has become a kids pool with the hot tub the same way. At one count there were 15 young kids in and around the hot tub. I saw several adults walk up and immediately turn away. No way I am getting in that hot tub with kids. Don't get me wrong I like kids and its great seeing so many families out enjoying themselves but not in the numbers the Mirage has nor in a setting like this. Its just not my cup of tea. If you have kids by all means give it a try the kids will love the pool and hot tub. As for the hotel rooms and casino I still think that they are great. Its a beautiful hotel with some nice grounds. Perhaps their prices have dropped to draw in more people and with that comes a different clientele.
50,From the moment I walked in the door i recognized the smell of the hotel. Always smelt fresh and candy like. The sounds of the waterfall in the lobby was refreshing. The staff was great. The check-out process was quick and easy.
50,Had enjoyed my first experience at the Mirage so stayed there again  Loved it and what’s even better is the casino has updated a lot of their games so stayed there gambling a lot more than last time  Also won which is always a bonus  Fabulous stay in fabulous Vegas at fabulous mirage
30,How is the pool so cold when it’s over 100 degrees here? I came in October and figured the pool was ice because of that. No it’s summer time and my kids couldn’t stay in the pool longer than 20 min. Fix the pool :/
30,Our first room was 2 queens when we reserved one king. The next room had a foul odor that was coming from shower drain. We didnt want to complain again so we dealt with the smell. This hotel needs to be updated.
40,The hotel is right in the middle of the strip and my room had an awesome view of the strip especially at night. Prolly one of the best pools in Vegas and the casino itself has a great selection of entertainment and different restaurants. Had an awesome time and would definitely recommend it!
40,I stayed here for a couple nights for a conference. The conference space was very nice and I was impressed with the food selection during the seminar.    The room was average nothing fancy. There was nothing wrong with the room but it did feel a little dated after staying at other Vegas properties.
50,Excellent service from the front desk staff. Enjoyable activities and shows. The concierge desk helped us make the best decision for a show. They also helped us to get a nice discount for the show since it was last minute.
40,The Mirage has some of the best rooms on the strip. Everything was fine until check out when we found out we had to pay $15 for parking. How do you charge a paying customer to park. We will never return to the Mirage again.
50,Two night stay at the Mirage to see the Love Show and Paul McCartney. The shows were fantastic. The Love production is the best ever. Hotel stay was great. The Mirage is centrally located and has the best layout of the large casinos.
50,Staff very nice and always helpful set up for rooms  pool casino are easy to wlalk around restaurants were good and so was staff. Nice place with good service. Pool was awesome and we used the oasis pool and the staff there including concierge were always there to assist.
10,the refrigerator didn't work a TV didnt work the food courts downstairs were extremely overpriced and the food itself was terribly prepared and not worth serving. We were overcharged for our room.🤨
40,The Mirage was a great hotel for location least smoke and amazing shows. Our family of four stayed after a week of hiking national  parks so the city and show were a nice change of pace. The mirage was one of the best for least amount of smoke in the air. We read they have an extra system in place to  keep the air clean. We are not smokers so this mattered more than we realized.
20,"I normally don't complain or write reviews but I was very disappointed with our stay there in June 16-23 2019. While on vacation I did not expect to have to accept subpar amenities nor the treatment by the personnel. The carpet in the room was rippled in front of the bed (which I almost fell multiple times during our stay) the toilet would randomly flush the shower controls were loose the sheets were ripped the restaurant (Pantry) staff was extremely rude and unprofessional the casino floor waitresses made me feel as if I was bothering them to order anything. The main reason for staying at this ""resort"" was for a volcano room. The lights shining on the building caused such a glare that it made it difficult and annoying to view the volcano show. I wish I never would have paid extra for the ""view"". I found it quite unfortunate and disappointing for me to travel half way across the country to visit your ""resort"". I did not feel welcome at all and I couldn't wait to leave. I know nothing will be done nor hear from any representative regarding my stay but I felt the need to express my disappointment and to inform them that there are plenty of hotels on the strip that want me to stay with them."
40,Great for a business stay. I had everything I needed. I would stay again. The LVB burger place is great! The convention space was nice as well. 1Oak is a nice place to hang out. The pool was very nice as well.
50,Our trip to Las Vegas was truly enhanced staying at the Mirage. It had been awhile since we had stayed there. The rooms were large and very clean and I enjoyed the smaller venue. Most importantly We found the staff especially Patricia in housekeeping and Victoria at the front desk to be friendly courteous and exceptional at their jobs! It was very refreshing and we will definitely be returning to the Mirage!
50,I just stayed at the Mirage for the first time. I've been going to Vegas for 10 years now but I'm not a fan of the strip. I had a one night comp so I figured why not. All the staff was friendly and helpful. The room was spotless colorful and the bed was like sleeping on a cloud. I've gotten some mediocre rooms in Vegas before this one is not one of those. I had a great stay and I would highly recommend it. I got to self park for free with my pearl card but with the almost $40 resort fee I think parking should be free for all guests.
30,"I was here for 5 nights for a conference that was being held at the Mirage convention center so I didn't have a say in my hotel selection. Overall I had a pleasant enough stay but it wasn't excellent and value for money is really poor.  I always experienced excellent customer service from the front desk staff to the waiters to even the maids everyone was friendly and genuine. The pool is lovely with lots of options if you're looking to bake in the sun or retreat into the quieter shade of the trees. The conference center was really excellent and well done so kudos to the hotel and staff for a great conference experience. The gym is awesome but only open until 7pm when the spa closes which is really disappointing since the gym between 5:30am-8am was waiting room only for machines which is crazy. I had a wonderful afternoon at the spa and had a great massage from Sylvia and the wet room in the spa is so relaxing. I would recommend the spa overall (though extremely expensive). And I spent a whole lot of time getting frozen yogurt by the pool. Overall location on the strip is excellent.  The major con is just value for money. Everything at the hotel is outrageously expensive but the quality is just so poor. The hotel room was just average the food was fine but not excellent. The entire casino lobby area reeks of cigarettes which meant I couldn't stand to eat at a single restaurant on the lobby floor. And I think worst of all for me was the dolphin pen and ""secret garden"" which has other wild animals. In this day in age I can't stand that you can still find dolphins and wild animals at a resort casino for people's entertainment. It was such a turn off that amongst the obscenity of drinking and gambling and debauchery are these poor animals. Please Mirage retire those poor animals to a sanctuary close that attraction and invest upgrades to the rooms and lobby! Personally would not stay again."
40,I stayed here for a business conference and had a great stay overall. The rooms are spacious and clean the beds are comfortable and the toiletries are good quality. The walls are somewhat thin and you can hear neighbors. The hotel itself has a lot to do inside. There are multiple restaurants. We went to the Pantry multiple times and it was delicious. We also went to Stack and it was top notch. Vince was our waiter and he was excellent. Carnegie Deli was great for breakfast. Tried Tom Colicchio’s steakhouse and wasn’t impressed. The steak was good and the sides and desserts were average at best. There is a frozen yogurt place that is divine. There is a Starbucks on site but be prepared to wait in line. We went to the Beatles Cirque du Soleil show and it was amazing and worth the spend. Pool is beautiful. We paid $50 a chair to go to the Private Oasis and it was worth it. It wasn’t crowded and pool service was great. We also went to the pool  Bar and got great drinks and service there. The one thing I didn’t like in the hotel is that smoking is allowed on the floor. It smells like smoke most of the day.
20,DO NOT EAT THE BUFFET. Literally wouldn’t feed it to a pig. Gross. I’ve had better food in public school lunches. We ended up leaving and the staff didn’t care we felt ripped off nor did they offer a refund. Be sure to get water at the nearest Walgreens as there is nothing but $18 bottles. Rhum bar has good drinks but it has to be the ugliest most unwelcoming bar I have ever seen. Looks like a bond villains house in the 90’s.    Our bathroom handle has some sort of white gunk on it. I am hoping it was dried lotion and not what I think it was. Bed said it was a king but it for sure was not a king. As someone who is 6’4 I did not fit well.    Great honeymoon /s
20,Just a old hotel..vents don't work properly in the bathroom. You can see the paint is old and needs to be re-painted. We had issue with the safe. First day bell boy was just standing there talking to another woman while we needed help. Would not go back for another stay.
30,Offered an upgrade of room for a fee and it wasn’t worth it at all. The room is still just as old as standard room and the view was no better. The shower door wouldn’t stay shut and fan smelled like cigarette smoke.
40,Have been to Vegas numerous times and stayed at the Mirage a number of times. This hotel is always consistent. Service is great pool is an oasis and it’s probably the least smokiest casino. Have to post this review because of the incredible service I received checking out. Victoria was fantastic. I had a number of requests for my check out and for another upcoming stay and she made it all very easy and seamless. She went above and beyond and this is just an example of the service you will receive staying at this property. Thank you Victoria! You are awesome!
50,great hotel in an ideal location on the strip rooms are spotless and beds really comfortable. staff are friendly and rooms are quiet so you can get a good nights sleep. the only bad thing here is to be careful not to pick any of the products up from the mini bar. the nuts crisps etc are on a sensor and if they are removed for more than 15 seconds they will be charged to your room and a 2 litre bottle of water is 18 dollars so be careful not to pick anything up. the secret garden at the rear of the hotel is a good place to visit and make sure you see the volcano outside the hotel at night.
20,"Disrespectful and sexist attitude at the front desk by staff and manager Eddie David. Solo female travelers beware! My word as a female was automatically assigned no merit - David at the Front Desk kept ignoring me being in front of him and talking to him like I was invisible while he kept calling ""next in line"". Nobody was reacting to his ""next in line"" calls since the ""next in line"" was already with him. Unfortunately David would not take my word on this. Finally a gentlemen who was behind me in line figured out that I was being ignored and dismissed and took the initiative to help me out by loudly stating ""She is next"". Somehow his words were of more value to David than mine and I have stopped being invisible to him. His manager Eddie Davis has only added an insult to an injury by dismissing behavior as “unimportant” since David had ended up helping me in the end. Much training on empathy around such sensitive issues like racism and sexist and unconscious bias is needed at this place. This is ugly - now I get it what my non-white mean when they say they sometimes feel invisible."
40,The Mirage is a very nice hotel but I think the rooms or at least the room that we were in should be nicer and more up-to-date and should have a table and 2 chairs to sit in. Otherwise the staff was wonderful!!!
20,I was given a room with burnt headboard and when I got it changed the second one was with mattresses that had depressions in them...I didn't feel like that I got the value for the money I spent ...so if you are traveling with family choose something different
50,"Went with 9 other couples. The property is perfectly located for maximum exposure to fun on the strip. Great value compared to some of the others nearby. Plenty of great restaurants and clubs for nightlife...in particular The Rhumbar. There is also a great pool area with tons of seating and a wonderful poolside bar. The best of all is their benchmark entertainment offering...""Love"" the Cirque du Soleil tribute to The Beatles. It was an A+ experience!"
50,I had a pleasant stay at the Mirage during my visit for CCW Conference. The staff was very pleasant accommodating and attentive to our needs. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Bell Station was amazing!
10,I will never go back! To be honest the only reason we made reservations for this hotel is because a comic that we really like was playing there and my husband has mobility issues so the short walk to the theater was appealing. It started upon check in. We arrived between 2:30 and 3:00 which check in time is 3:00 PM. We were told that the room we had reserved months prior was not available and that we would have to have a smaller room with two Queen Beds instead of a King. I purposely book through the hotel directly so this will not happen. We were told that they would waive the resort fee for our three day stay and would move us to the room we reserved in the morning. Since we had no choice we agreed. The room we were given was okay but no King bed and no soaking tub which were the reasons we booked the other room. We went downstairs to grab a late lunch and dined in their “café”. My husband ordered the BLT which had burned toast and I mistakenly ordered the fish and grits. Needless to say unimpressed and I felt queasy afterward. We went back to the room for the night as we were tired from the long drive.  I called the front desk the next morning and spoke with Irene to find out what time we would be moved and she stated that they “do not move any guest except between the hours of 1 and 4 PM”. Further we had to be present for the move. After several more calls to Ashley Iren and Derek at the bell desk we heard a knock on our door at 3:58 with our keys. This pretty much shot the entire afternoon. The bellman did not have a luggage cart and stated that we would need to call for one which we did. We finally moved into our new room which had a much more comfortable bed and the soaking tub! By this time we were not impressed with the service and were disenchanted with the entire experience. We decided to cancel our last day and leave in the morning.  Just so you know the mini fridge in the room is filled with mini bar items with no room for any of your own items (see image) rendering that fridge as useless. Also there is no coffee maker in the room…even The Comfort Inn has this.
50,Excellent experience clean rooms great service lots do in the hotel great location great variety of food entertainment casino experience family oriented diverse atmosphere would recommend to family and friends!
40,Mirage is still a great property. Rooms are showing wear and tear. Slots were tight but the drink service was good. They need a couple of lower price quick service food options. It was still an overall good experience.
40,This is one of my favorite places to stay on the strip. GREAT POOL!!! Clean and comfortable rooms. Great ambiance. Food prices are high. But aren't they all? It's conveniently located on the strip. So you can walk to other nearby attractions. Overall a very good value!
40,We’ve been staying at the Mirage for 20 years. The rooms could use some updating but it is still the greatest place to stay. It is centrally located and has all you could want. We wouldn’t stay anywhere else.
10,Do not stay here the rooms are out dated and rooms are hot. Casino smells! Onoy good thing was the food. The Beetles show was amazing it was worth seeing. Would eat here but dont stay the rooms also smell old!
30,The location of the Mirage is excellent and the pool is awesome. Other than that it’s your typical hotel with a casino and some restaurants. Although I did find that the amenities in this hotel weren’t as good as others I’ve been to. Has some OK restaurants but unfortunately nothing impressive and no fast food chains or easy eats for after a night out. Had to go to the strip for that. We had an unfortunate check in error which the staff were very friendly and helpful to fix. Overall we had a nice stay and the rooms are very clean the staff is very friendly and the hotel is sufficient. But it didn’t blow me away
10,"Reported a problem with the TV charged $600 no discussion. The hotel itself is nice. good casino good restaurants etc but watch out when you report an existing issue - you will be blamed for it and your card will be charged. When I asked questions the only answer was ""dispute the charge"". OK I will."
40,I was fortunate enough to stay on 24 floor. My room was nice but not Wow. Tub is nice and deep. Plumbing does make some funny noises from time to time. The outlet situation near bed isn’t great. I was having to become a contortionist to plug in some needed stuff. There is a desk that had some outlets across the room but only one plug worked. The usb and other things all were dead. Housecleaning was wonderful. Fridge is stocked with stupid prices. WiFi works great. Tv is decent but can’t angle it.    All in all decent place. But can’t say I just have to stay here again.
50,Stayed at Mirage for 6 nights with my husband . Had stayed at other hotels on the strip but this by far  was our favorite. Check in was easy . We had a room on the 25th floor which had a private elevator that just serviced the rooms on the 24th and 25 th floors so there was no long waits for an elevator. Get an MLife card when I get here and start racking up points. If u present it in the gift shop you will receive a discount . If you can afford it  reserve chairs at the private oasis pool . They have umbrellas there by all chairs and waitress service . Tried the regular pool first day we were here and felt like a sardine . Staff at Oasis pool are very accommodating and helpful. Always had a smile on their faces . Ariel was great . Very nice girl with a bubbly personality. Took time to socialize with guests which made it personal. Will definitely return to this hotel and the Oasis pool .
10,We were scheduled to arrive on 6/21/2019 but our flight was cancelled due to Weather. We spoke to the Mirage by phone that night and were assured that our room would be held and that we could extend a night on the other end. When we checked in the next morning we were told once again that it was no problem to extend the stay and that they were waiting for information from Southwest but not to worry. Since we booked this trip through Southwest.com we had to go through them also which we did. Apparently if you book with a 3rd party you are a 2nd class citizen at the Mirage. They overbooked the Hotel by 80 rooms and we were told we could not stay the additional night after we changed our flight because we were told by the Mirage that we would be accommodated. They told us we needed to find our own accommodations elsewhere and that we were being charged for the night that we weren't even there! When we expressed our displeasure they offered a room for $1000! Unbelievable. This was over our heads and unresolved our entire stay and we lost our last full day because we had to change hotels. They have since removed the charge for the night we weren't there but this issue is not resolved and it ruined our wedding anniversary trip by adding stress to what was supposed to be a relaxing four days. Do not ever trust what they tell you.
50,A great Hotel/Casino to you and your family to stay at. The employees seem to enjoy where they work. The rooms are comfortable and big. The pool is outstanding. The restaurants are great. It is located where you can walk to almost anywhere to have a fantastic day or night.
50,We stayed here to see some of the Cirque shows and run around. The Mirage is centrally located and very easy to move around in the casino and close to other casinos. We really enjoyed the various dining places. Stacks is fantastic. We also really liked the Room Service choices. Food was top notch.
30,Stayed there 2 nights and ended up pretty disappointed with our room. First they couldn't get us the room type we booked and the room we got didn't hate the AC working properly.    That being said they did offer us a $75 resort credit to be spent towards food and drinks. The other disappointing aspects was the pool closed at 3pm on our first day there due to an event. At $42 per day for the resort fees youd think they'd take that in consideration.    The check in and check out also took over 30 minutes each time they always seemed under staff at the peak times. The only positive point I have and lead me to this average review was our check out clerk Freddy who did everything he can to make up for all the negative things that happened. Thanks again Freddy for making us feel a little bit better about our experience at the Mirage.
10,When my sister in law planned our double celebration in June I pushed for us to stay at The Mirage as my husband and I loved staying there in the past. She booked the books so she could earn points to keep her status. When booking our rooms we booked a handicap accessable room with a lift as my husband has been in a wheelchair for the past year and a half. This is still all new to us but since I saw they offer rooms with lifts I was so glad as it is really hard for my husband to get on and off his chair. On Friday 6/21 we arrived early as we were told our rooms were ready when we got there we valeted on the north side 2 cars. They got a bell person named Alex who went out of her way to unload their items from the car and we got Li who did nothing to help me unload he just stood there as I unloaded all of our item put them on the car and even counted the items for him to write it on the ticket. As we got to the front desk to check in we were told the rooms were not ready as like before when we had called. Kyle who did the precheck in on the platinum/noir line was very nice. My sister in law has platinum status and I have pearl. Kyle confirmed with us we have a regular room and a handicap accessable room with the lift. We were told we would receive a text message letting us know when our rooms would be ready bythe said that if by 3pm we did not get a text to stop by the front desk. So we decided to go to LV Burgers and have lunch. Burgers there are amazing. 3pm came no text so we went back to the front desk. We were told 1 room was ready which was the handicap accessable room with the lift. Room was 02102 we get there no sitting chairs and guess what no lift. My sister in law and I were very confused and bothered. She called the front desk from the room asked to speak to a manager they put her on hold which took awhile so she decided to call from her cell and spoke to Alex. She explained the issue now as she is talking to Alex I am on hold with the front desk using the room phone. An agent gets on the phone apologies and said engineering is looking for the lift and would be bringing it to the room I say thank you and hang up. Now at that moment Alex informs my sister in law that they made a mistake and oversold on the lift rooms therefore no lifts are available. A bit contradicting when I was told one would be on it's way. By that point we were upset. How can you oversell a handicap accessable room with the lift if someone books that type of room it is because they need it unacceptable. So Alex informed my sister in law that an agent would come to our room to show us a room that would suit us best as my sister in law was also told their room would be directly across from ours and was not. Julian comes to the room and shows us room 29028 a 2 bedroom suite that 1 room is a handicap accessable room minus the lift. Again not what I booked but at this point my husband was starting to feel bad. The room is 1600 sq ft very nice with as beautiful view of the strip. My sister in law's side of the bedroom very nice very big spacious bathroom with walking closet separate shower with a jetted tub and double sinks. Handicap side was missing chairsin the bed area regular closet bathroom big to have a wheelchair enter but no sink space who ever designed the shower area has no clue the space a person in a wheelchair needs to get in and out of the shower. Dropping the bench ended up taking a lot of space plus sit is low the shower head had different settings but water temperature would not stay to what it was set and the towels with stains on them. After accepting the room we were told our reservations would be combined 200 off and no resort fees we said ok but for me disappointed. That same night my sister in law had to call engineering for several things TV had to be realigned refrigerators were not cooling and some funky disgusting stuff was backing up in her jetted tub. Engineer came fixed all issues I wish I would have seen his name so he could be added to this review. We that night ate at the pantry which has good food. When we got back my husband asked to take a shower as I mentioned no room for wheelchair and sit is low he used his transfer board to slide down would have been great to have a lift. He had hard time showering as not much space water kept getting hot no matter the setting and grab bars need to be placed in the correct grab area. After he was done he had the hardest time getting back his chair that for a few minutes he cried because how difficult it was remember only a year and a half in this condition. It broke my heart and made me angry at The Mirage for not giving us what we booked. I had the hardest time getting him on to his chair that once it was done he even said I should been given the lift. Needless to say that was the only time he showered. I felt so bad during our trip. I know this a long review but I am so angry and disappointed at this place. We used to love going there before his condition and now just disappointed. We checked out on Tuesday 6/25 name Alarcon but it is the Valdez party that is writing this review.
50,Mirage places you centrally on the strip a quick walk to so many attractions both within the Mirage or a short walk or tram ride!  If you haven't seen the Beatles Love show do yourself a favor and go! The second time was even better so much action its hard to keep up with everything. The Mirage offers so much no matter what your taste's are.
50,Love this place from front door to room takes 5 min max. Not like other casinos. I love this place hope it never changes. Room was upgraded for a small fee but it was well worth it. Wish the sports book was smoking but that’s impossible to find on the strip anymore.
40,stay was overall very nice. Rooms need to be cleaned better and bathrooms updated. Good staff love the entrance to the hotel. Casino has a nice layout and loved RUTH the Israeli Dealer she was a bad ass. Drink ladies were on time and quick...got to love that. Pool scene was hoppin and would love to come back if we can get the rooms cleaned up a tad. Overall great trip with my father and look forward to coming back to Vegas (maybe the Mirage) in a few month.
50,Rooms were very clean and the service was great. The location is good however it is at the beginning of the strip so will require some walking to the other hotels/casinos. Very affordable option in Vegas. Would stay again for sure!
10,Mirage features a $22 animal exhibit they call the Secret Garden with Siegfried and Roy’s famous white tigers also lions and dolphins in captivity. While surely the enclosures for these beautiful creatures meet the state requirement everyone in the 21st-century knows that wild animals require extensive space to roam and maintain quality lives. I wanted to film and photograph it but I refuse to pay the $22 admission fee to support the keeping of these animals in enclosures. It is disappointing that these displays continue to be tourist attractions and I hope that people educate themselves on fair treatment and rights for animals who have no voice. Please boycott this exhibit.
20,For as much money as you spend on a hotel room one the room should be available after you have made the reservation 2months in advanced and two as a guest I should not feel like the casino is a bigger cheapskate than their customers.
40,This was a business and pleasure stay. Very glad the conference dates changed from the last week of June when EDM has typically been scheduled. This seemed to be a relatively calm week for Vegas which was nice. The hotel has a great pool area which is always packed.
50,We goi back here every year. Always have been treated well and the Staff are more than willing to assist your every question or need. We highly recommend the Mirage. After a few visits you feel almost like this is your home away from home.
40,our room on stay well floor (12th) was great. Highly recommend the Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat for the kids. But don't let kids touch anything in the minibar. A huge charge appears from just moving an item
10,The front desk executive Isha refused to check me in just because i complained about the long check-in line. And even the manager at duty supported her telling me to wait in line as he investigates the situation. Overall he did nothing and i had to wait to talk to check-in. Never experienced such rude behavior at any hotel before. Not worth staying!
40,Enjoyed my stay at the Mirage as it is my go-to in Vegas. The rooms are affordable and the overall the hotel/resort is nice. But it's time for them to consider refreshing the basic level rooms. The decor seems dated and overall use of the rooms is starting to take it's toll.    I had a very hard time finding an outlet to plug my phone in next to the bed. Eventually I had to move a large and heavy end table away from the wall to get to the outlet. Perhaps they should consider new alarm clocks so we can plug in our devices...?    I find the steakhouse at the Mirage to be very mediocre. I'm underwhelmed the only 2 times I've eaten there. However Otoro is fantastic! As is the CPK and Carnegie Deli.    Also unless you're being upgraded to a suite... a strip view isn't worth the extra price.
50,Fantastic hotel with amazing features. On the pricey side  but it's vegas. The Mirage is in the middle of the strip so great for seeing the sights & public transport is right outside. The nightly volcano is a must.
10,"We were in room 10046 last week. It is a two bedroom suite which initially appeared to be amazing! However once we entered the suite it became very apparent that there was a problem with the structure of the building. The master bedroom floor and the master bath floor appeared to be completely slanted towards the outer part of the building. It was so significant that I couldn't even walk back into either room. I went to the front desk and brought it to the attention of an employee who went and got a manager. I was told that this was an issue they were recently made aware of and it was a result of ""settling"" of the property over the years. I was told that that it was completely safe. What??? A room that has significant slanting floors due to settling is safe? I was told that the hotel was booked and there was nothing they could do. We headed to dinner and upon our return after thinking about how unacceptable this was I re-approached the front desk asking to speak with the manager again. This time a new manager (who was certainly trying his best to accommodate us) shared the same information but stated that the hotel was full and the only thing they could do was move us to 2 separate rooms with no kitchen (which the whole point of our trip was to be together as a family in the suite.) He said if anything else became available he would let us know and he offered and did take off $100/night for the troubles we had. Unfortunately it still left us sleeping on the couch because we did not feel safe in the bedroom or bathroom. I have never seen anything like it and if it wasn't for the fact that other hotels had no vacancies we would have left. I have never discouraged others from staying at a hotel but I would certainly re-think plans if you are planning a trip to the Mirage."
50,We will continue to make the Mirage our only destination. The quality of all services are simply amazing. Never once have had any issues with any of the services at the Mirage. From the food housekeeping servers and wait staff-just an overall perfect experience.
50,Clean and friendly environment. Nice casino excellent pool and great food. Right in the heart of the strip. An excellent value. The staff is excellent and the buffet is the best on the strip. I keep coming back for the Prime Rib.
10,Our room smelled like strong mildew and I complained twice with no resolution. First time they sent someone up with an air purifier? Not sure if that was a smart idea but I asked for housekeeping to come and clean it and they never showed up! The next compliant they finally came and supposedly cleaned it and sprayed a ton of air freshener to cover it up but a few ours later it was back to normal. Very disappointing I stay here all the time and spend a lot of money with them guess it’s time to find a new hotel.
50,This is second time we have stood at the mirage. It didn’t disappoint very friendly staff the room was excellent my girls enjoyed the pool . The food was excellent and bar was very lay back. I enjoyed my stay I would recommend the mirage to family and friends.
40,The location can't be beat. You're in the center of the action. The Venetian is across the street Ceasars Palace is next door and the Bellagio is close by. The Mirage has all the amenities you need and if you are on the 24th or 25th floor you'll get a good size room. The only issue for us was that our room 25-019 was quite shabby. It was badly in need of a refresh. That said it was so comfortable and functional we were willing to put up with the look of it. We also liked the fact that the music in the public areas of the hotel and the casinos was not as loud as it was in other hotels. We would definitely stay there again.    TIP: if you are a Veteran show your discharge papers at the Players Club desk and you'll be upgraded to Pearl status. That means FREE PARKING.    WARNING: Don't even touch the mini bar. We opened it just to take a look and incurred a $30 refreshment charge. Of course upon checkout when we explained we had not taken anything out they removed it.
50,This hotel is clean and the staff is friendly. I've stayed here every year for the last 6 years and my accommodations the staff and the property as a whole is always perfect. Good job to the management and the team for your attention to detail.
20,I’ve stayed before- and like the casino restaurant and pool.  We requested a single king room- instead they gave us a double queen handicap room. They said they were no king rooms available and it wouldn’t until the next afternoon that something was available.  The next night at 230am- we were awoken to a staff member banging on our door and opening our door and coming in while we were sleeping. We had the security bolt lock so then they started calling our room. They said it was a “status check.” Seemed REALLY unnecessary to do it at that time of the evening.
50,We love staying at the Mirage. There are plenty of restaurants inside to meet all different tastes and budgets. The pantry has the best food and we love ordering the pizza for the room. LVBurger was also great for a burger and milkshake. The pool is beautiful just get there early to find a seat. Every employee we spoke to at the hotel was extremely friendly and outgoing. Top-notch service!!!
10,My wife and I had dinner at the Heritage Restaurant. I don’t recommend the Heritage to anyone. Service was slow and they weren’t even busy. The staff was to busy talking to each other. I had to send my Steak back because is was over cooked. Overpriced as well.
30,Hotel had a pretty good rate but room was dated. Windows were dirty shower drained slowly. You can count the number of retail shops on one hand. The buffet is pretty good and service was good! Also unlimited beer & wine which was great. The Pantry restaurant was also very good with great service.
50,I really enjoyed my stay at the Mirage. The hospitality is second to none the guest rooms are clean and spacious and for those who like to relax the Spa is a great deal and very close to restaurants and very close to the guest rooms. Like to see dolphins up close? Then stay at The Mirage.
50,LOVE is the best CIRQUE show!! Front row seats closest to stage are a must. And dinner prior at STACK!! YUM!! If you want to go to the Pancake breakfast place send someone from you party down EARLY to stand in line!!
30,Just got back home from our 4 night stay. Room 8104 needs a severe update or refurbish. Fake leather peeling from the headboard with large chunks taken out large collecting of dust in ALL of the corners of the carpet chunks of wood taken out of the desk stains on the bathroom mirror sink toilet & rust in the bath tub. Not to mention broken fixtures and ripped lamp shades. Not exactly the WOW factor you expect to see when entering your room while in Vegas.    When checking in we were told this was the only room they had even after we asked what our options would be if we wanted to upgrade which is fine. We arrived later in the evening so better rooms were already gone we understood.    We’ve stayed at the Mirage before and loved it but this time around was a terrible let down considering it was my birthday weekend trip. For the money that we paid we expected the same service and stay we enjoyed the last time we stayed at The Mirage. That’s the main reason we chose the Mirage to stay at again. I’ve stayed in nicer two star hotel rooms if I’m being completely honest.    Check out is at 11 AM and on the day we checked out (Sunday) even with a “Privacy Please” sign on the door handle a cleaning lady tried to enter our room at 10:00 AM. And proceeded to keep trying to open the door even though the silver door lock was latched. I finally opened the door and asked the lady if she needed something and she asked if we were checking out I asked her if check out was still 11 and she said yes. I feel it rude that unless you have it printed on a sheet of paper that someone has gone to the front desk and formally checked out with them before 11 that the cleaning ladies do not try to enter a guests room before 11.    Buffet is just ok. Nothing special either. We went for both Breakfast and Brunch on two separate days.    Card dealers act like they hate their job. All of them non-vocal. Our visit last time they would talk with you or hold friendly conversation. Now they stand there like mindless robots. Not a fun atmosphere to want to keep spending money in.    Upon checking out at the desk a receptionist helping to guide the line asked us how our stay was and I simply said “Vegas was good but after staying here we probably won’t return back to this hotel.” She nervously laughed but didn’t seem to care either way if the guests had a good time or not.    Location is probably the only upside to staying here and also a reason why we returned.    Next time we stay in Vegas we will not be staying with any M Life properties. There are far better choices to spend our money at. Our stay just wasn’t worth the money dished our unfortunately.
50,Had a great stay at the Mirage. The location is perfect and close to everything. We never needed a car.    Our room was nice and clean.    Check in and out went fine. It can be a long line during prime times but that's understandable.    We checked out The Secret Garden which was so neat to see. We timed our visit there perfectly and got to see the switch out of the big cats. We even had a nice time speaking with the staff as they explained how they are still all human handled.    The Rumbar at the hotel was a nice spot to get a drink and sit outside.
20,My wife and I prepaid a lot to stay at Mirage over a 4-day weekend. Yet it still cost me $231 to checkout: resort fee + taxes & $15/day for parking! Despicable! I paid $5 to print out my boarding passes & it cost $3 more to actually print them - after they already had my $5! Don’t get me wrong the property is gorgeous and the staff super friendly. It’s just: you’re not a customer that they appreciate. You’re just an open wallet walking around and they are trying as hard as they can to figure out all these different ways to suck money out of it before you leave. We staid at The Mirage the 1st year that it was open. Back then they cared about you as a customer and they wanted you to come back. Now they don’t care about you only your wallet. They don’t really care if you come back or not - that’s pretty obvious. When I checked out the girl gave me a big smile and asked me about my stay. So I told her. She didn’t really care. Get used to that!
30,Check in was very slow and we were given a different type of room without explanation. There is no coffee in the room and you can only order a $17 box of coffee from room service. Room service food comes in a bag from their restaurant and you have to set it up yourself. They just hand it to you at the door. Food comes in plastic containers. Resort fee for things other hotels give you for free.
30,First why wouldn't you access to get WATER outside of the room faucet to fill as you go? I found other Hotel Casinos definitely more welcoming and helpful. Restaurant The Pantry $5.45 for a to go coffee that was not drinkable.
30,Dated hotel compared to the newer ones. . Good location on the strip. Small bathroom for a Vegas hotel. Good restaurants. Casino nothing special. Beatles Love is good but not spectacular. It is just ok.
50,Mirage is a Great Hotel! Great Buffet if u r a drinker n like good food! Their Buffet has all the wine n beer u can drink! Located walking distance and middle of everthing one need to see n visit! Next to Caesar Palace across from Venetian n a short walk to The Mall
50,The staff is extremely friendly and really makes you feels appreciated! The Mirage is centrally located which is great for shopping exploring the strip other casinos or restaurants! We ate all but one of our meals there because the restaurants are so good!
40,Spacious and clean rooms.  Excellent Security precautions and presence.  Beautiful pool area with cascading waterfalls.  Large casio area; although too many $1 slots and not enough video poker ones.  Overall a nice hotel but nothing for children.
50,This was my first trip to Vegas. We came on a girls trip. The pool was amazing!! It was clean with comfortable chairs. If you didn't want to leave the facility you didn't have to. There is plenty of restaurants gift shops and casino under one roof.
50,I was at the Mirage for a business trip for a week. During my time I enjoyed clean rooms a good view and no waiting for elevators (which is a plus when it's such a large hotel!) However be prepared to spend plenty of money at restaurants and drinks here.
50,The Mirage is a great hotel...I like to visit when i come for business. The only thing is the smell in the carpet because of the smoke inside the casino. All of the staff around the hotel was very friendly and helpful.
50,No complaints. Was great from beginning to end. Location nice price is good facilities great. We had a great time here! Bed was comfortable. Only thing we didn’t win but that’s Vegas. Staff was nice and welcoming.
50,My Friends and I stayed at the mirage in June 2019. Awesome staff!! Very friendly and helpful. Rooms and bathrooms were very clean. I have stayed at the Mirage several times and will definitely go back.
20,Valet charges not disclosed until arriving. Drinks over priced. $25 for a drink at pool + tax. + resort fees. You get nickel and dimed for extra charges. Not worth it. Toilet partiall clogged. Maid service didn’t come until after 6 pm.
50,Exceptional Service by staff front desk Chefs receptionist and waitress. Had a great time staying at this casino/hotel.  The pool area remained clean our entire stay. Accidentally I waste my drink in an attempt to take my seat. Long story short our barmaid made the drink over! Thank goodness. Will definitely come back and refer this hotel to our family and friends!  2 ladies take on Vegas🤷‍♀️
40,Went to the Cravings Buffet. Had a buy one get one free coupon.we went for breakfast but it also turned into lunch. A large selection of delicious food. Well presented. Would definitely do it again.  Did not have to wait in long lines. They also had a beverage self service bar. Courteous staff.
50,My husband and myself just got back from 12 days staying at The Mirage and we couldn’t have been happier.    At check in we were upgraded to a tower deluxe room on the 24th floor the private elevator and bigger bathroom were much appreciated during our stay.    The hotel and casino are clean and always smell so good our room was cleaned to a very high standard every day.    Would be very happy to stay here again.
40,Good hotel for a base easy walking for the strip in either direction staff very friendly and accommodating for any needs.  Didn’t get 5 stars because: 1 - shower was over bath come on guys this is 21st century baths out and walk in showers please!!! On holiday who has time for a bath!!! 2 - There is a hidden $300 ‘service’ charge that we didn’t know about hidden in the small print we missed when booking online.  Paid extra for a ‘partial strip view’ and they were spot on with the description we can see about 30 mtrs of the actual ‘strip’ 150 mtrs away from room!!  Overall pleased with stay and would stay here again 👍👍👍
30,The food and water was crazy expensive. Paid $6.75 for a bottle of water. The pool was very crowded people everywhere nowhere to sit waited until early evening to swim just so we could do something other that stand in the pool and walk around less people then
40,All of the people there are great. From check-in to the staff in all the restaurants. Had some decent luck in the casino too! The rooms are just fine hotel rooms. Nothing special. There is a closet with an ironing board & iron. A hair dryer was discovered in a drawer in the bathroom. No place to hang towels yet they ask that you hang your towels if you plan to reuse them in order to conserve water. Don't inspect any of the food or beverage items on top of the counter or in the mini-fridge - you'll be charged whether you use them or not! Tip - if you are staying there and dine at the buffet Craving tell them you're staying there to receive a 20% discount on your meal!!! Really good deal! Don't forget the Beatles Love show. Skip the line for breakfast or brunch at the Pantry and go to the Paradise restaurant by the pool. No waiting! The Pantry IS good though.
30,The minibar is a bad joke. In vacation I have to stay with fear that my kids will remove one candy bag and I’ll be charged even if I never opened it. I found hair in bathroom and in beds. Gross. I will stay away from this hotel.
50,The stay at mirage was excellent. Check out all the features they have to offer. Friendly staff. Big casino floor. Lot of indoor activities. The dolphin habitat is a must visit. The Bare pool is awesome. Volcano view is too good.
30,Disappointed Comps. Had trouble at check out trying to have some of the fees comped!! 15$ per day for self parking or 24$ per day for valet!! Plus 40$ per day for resort fees!! It was a +700$ stay!!!!
40,I expected this hotel to be old and old fashioned but i found it surprisingly muce nicer and better than expected.  The lobby area is well maintained the casino is not too big but still spacious they have nice selection of restaurants including vegan options of burgers (LVB) and pizza (CPK) the rooms were nice and spacious and overall I loved it there.  The Beatles vibes of the cirque de soleil show is a great benefit!
50,"We love staying at The Mirage. The rooms and staff are great and you can't really beat the location. I like that it's right next to Caesars Forum shops and not too far from Fashion Show Mall. These are always my two ""go to"" places when we come to Las Vegas about every week or two.  The only negative is the unfair parking fee. No hotel/casino should be charging a parking fee for self parking. This is awfully greedy."
50,Traveled with our son and wife and two adult children one celebrating 21st birthday. A nice place to stay easy to find each other and we loved spending time at the pool which is easily accessible from the rooms. Restaurants are varied and good.
50,My favorite hotel on the strip.... every trip is a fun one. From check in to eating to gambling to the pool.. all went well as usual. I love the location and although I've stayed at most of the major hotels on the strip this is my favorite year in and year out
50,I had a conference so I decided to bring the family along with and make a mini vacation after the conference. The Mirage has entertainment for the kids adults lots of restaurants and fun. I only left once the entire week!
50,The Mirage was fantastic. The staff INCREDBILE.  Even the hard working house keeping team always greeted me when I walked by. They and everyone has a great attitude. And Aubry the concierge The Best EVER!
50,We've tried other hotels but keep coming back to the Mirage. Fantastic buffet wonderful staff and great location. Not to mention it smells amazing. Not sure what their signature scent is but every year it reminds us of vacation time.
10,On arrival- the front desk experience was terrible - Pre- booking on the phone was great - they made notes - - then in person on check in - front desk had attitude- I reminded them about sons 21st - our 32nd Anniversary/ Plus two daughters / family of 5 - acted like - so what - I don’t care - if I was by myself- I would of walked out n went elsewhere - my two cents  Customer care is at a low level at the mirage
50,Beautiful property. Free parking at treasure island next door and then you can take the free tram to the front of the mirage. Rooms are modern and clean. staff is friendly. Accessible cross walks surrounding the property. Good eating places close by. Large pool and open seating.
40,This was Steve Wynn's first mega luxury Vegas resort casino. It is very well maintained beautiful lobby and public areas. Guest rooms are very nice on par with any of the top 10 hotel resorts on the strip. The Mirage has several really good restaurants on-site and for all budget levels and has the Beatles Love Cirque du Soleil show which is awesome. Highly recommend this hotel. Perfectly located between other main attractions on the srip so easy to walk to Caesars The Wynn Venetian etc.
50,Hey everyone you need to stay at this hotel the staff are amazing! And the location is perfect very close located by bus stops and shopping you should check out the cravings buffet the food is always fresh the staff is very friendly we really enjoyed the complimentary beer and wine very good value for the price. We will definitely be staying at the Mirage again. 🙂
50,We just got back form 3 nights at The Mirage - we loved every minute of our stay. Our room was clean and spacious. The staff was always polite and courteous. The casino was fun with a wide variety of games. The whole place and experience was fantastic - we will suredly be coming back.
30,Beware the ugly paid parking hassle. Six trips back and forth from the player club to the front desk trying to decide what level players club card I was. No more bathrobes and slippers in the rooms. There are other options.
40,Mirage has one of the best locations and a really solid casino that accommodates all levels of play. That's important for us since our group has both big players and some young novice players. It had been 8 years since we last stayed. The rooms are much nicer! The variety of restaurants is great for a big group. The pool is gorgeous but does NOT have the party atmosphere it had 8 years ago. It is much more a family scene although the younger guys in our group found plenty of social atmosphere at the Bare Pool.  Service level in the casino is excellent. There's always a table you're looking for available and they're quick on drink service...since hydration in the desert is very important. ;) It's not quite the service level of an Encore or Bellagio but it's by far the best in this price range.
30,Stayed here last three trips. Nothing great to say this time and aside from no refrigerator in room nothing bad to say.    We usually pay to upgrade to suite at check in but this time they did not offer. Hotel was pretty empty so not sure why they didn't offer but this means we saved money.    Pool is always nice which is big reason we choose Mirage.    One can die of thirst in Casino waiting for a free drink offer here. Then when my wife asked a passing waitress for drinks she coldly replied it is not her section and walked away. No big deal. We went to Casino Royal and gave them our gambling money instead. And got free drinks quickly.    Bottom line if you get a good rate I would stay here but there are better options so look around first.
50,Great time at the Mirage. The Terry Fator show was fantastic!! The M--Life staff was outstanding and very helpful. I was a little disappointed in the pool (very crowded but that is to be expected this time of the year).
50,Stayed in this hotel as a family and friends group and as a couple. Could't ask for more from a Las Vegas hotel. It is our favorite hotel on the strip. The rooms are lovely and comfortable and we have always had a great view the restaurant options are incredible the casino is huge and welcoming the other faculties are great. The hotel is also in a prime location on the strip.
50,Great hotel centrally located right in the middle of the strip!! Pool was great restaurants are good staff is very friendly and helpful!! Will definitely book my future stays at the mirage!! Very highly recommended!!
50,The Mirage is a great place to stay... We throughly enjoyed all the amenities everything is very up to date and clean. No detail was left undone. The staff helped make our visit very memorable. All the dealers were very helpful and did not make you feel rushed.
50,Exceptional service clean resort the Volcano at night is amazing. Good restaurants fun slots to play. Centrally located on the strip. Easy to get around this resort. Beautiful pool area with an excellent restaurant near by
10,Despite paying for three nights I only stayed one.    My trip to Las Vegas was delayed but despite paying for the first night I was not able to check in until 4PM on the second night. Despite checking out in the AM of the second night I was charged for the third.    OK They got me this time...
50,I was fortunate enough to stay in the villas. It's hard to accurately describe how fabulous it was. The staff was extremely friendly from the butler chef concierge and host. The villa had a pool hottub multiple bars and outdoor seating for more than 30 people
50,First time at this hotel. From the moment I arrived at the valet parking to the moment I stepped in the room all staff members were incredible!  Beautiful hotel. I would say it’s the best resort on the strip!
30,First time in Vegas. Chose this location because it was centrally located on the strip. Check in staff were not particularly friendly nor did they offer any information about the features of the hotel. Beatles show was great!
10,We arrived at 4 pm and our suite wasn’t ready. Had to wait until 5 to get in. Out sinks were clogged and toilet wouldn’t flush. The air condition vent made rattling noise all night long. Concierge is rude and unprofessional. Would definitely not recommend this place
30,So we stayed in the mirage over the last week. As you walk in it’s beautiful and you feel taken back straight away. As you walk through we see the hotel is dated and this shows in the rooms. Our room we had was a good size but the main door was very stiff to the point you needed a solid nudge with your foot to open it along with the bathroom door being stiff to the point it felt locked !  The rooms were tidy but not clean. There were several areas with thick dust that haven’t seen a duster in years.  As for location it’s perfect easy walking to all main hotels. Would I stay here again ? I wasn’t overly excited by it so unless someone was paying for me to I’d leave it.    Couldn’t fault the front of house staff but the cleaning crew need a review !    Thanks for the stay
50,Highly recommend visiting Dave S. at the Dolphin Pool Bar. Very entertaining and attentive. Great food at The Still California Pizza and LVB. A great relaxing stay and a iconic strip property. If you get overwhelmed by the size of the newer mega casinos you will find the Mirage to be a bit smaller and easier to navigate. We look forward to returning in the future.Food could be more affordable but overall a great experience.
40,The hotel was beautiful and everything we expected. It was right in the middle of the strip so a great starting point each day to explore the other hotels. There are so many different places to eat and drink (and gamble ofcourse) that you could probably have spent the whole week in there never needing to leave!  The pancakes at Pantry were so so good and the LVB burgers were delicious.    Our favourite was the pool area its lush and has a really good atmosphere and even on the busier days we were always able to find a sunbed.    My only complaint would be the drinks in the room. The bottles of water were about $15 in the room rather than the $6 from the shop downstairs (and $1 in the CVS down the road) and as the fridge was fully stocked with alcohol that is weighted (we didnt touch it for fear of being charged) so we didnt even have the option to move a few things out to keep our water cool. But hey I guess that's just Vegas!    The staff were all amazing so friendly and helpful and whenever they saw our room key they wished my husband a happy birthday which was a nice touch.    Our room faced a little of the strip (ceasars and Paris) aswell as the pool and though it was nice I do wish we'd taken the offered upgrade when we checked in as I think the views would have been that bit more impressive from the 15th floor and up. The room itself was large and had everything you needed.    I'd definitely stay here again!
50,We have stayed at many locations on the Strip and this was by far our favorite! The pool was amazing guest rooms are very spacious and clean the location is PERFECT and the staff is very accommodating. I cannot think of a reason not to stay here!
40,Stayed there the week of June 9th on a 4 night comp. The room was spacious and clean. Was supposed to be a Volcano Room View but they gave us a view of the roof below but for free it is hard to complain. The pool was very nice and refreshing. The only draw back about the pool is the cost of the drinks and food better have deep pockets if you are going to stay at the pool most of the day. Staff throughout the hotel and casino were very friendly.
50,I had never stayed here but we wanted to try somewhere different and it didn’t disappoint! Everything from check-in/out was easy the food at the restaurants was excellent the staff was friendly and the concierge helped us book a cabana and that put it over the top. We will definitely stay here again.
50,First time at the Mirage and I was pleased wasn’t all the B.S. glitz and glamour that a 20 year old would require. What it did have was “Style” which is what everyone would appreciate. If you want a place to relax by the pool and listen to music and enjoy a beautiful large pool area this is it. If you want a spot in the mid strip close to all that has great drinks “The Still” bar and on Friday Latin music this is it. Had a great stay with no issues or drama..
30,Staff pleasant have to pay for everything! Scratchy towels low water pressure and TV kept messing up. Poor TV channel choices. Had long wait times for cafe and Starbucks. Prices almost twice what you'd expect to pay
40,Excellent location and really good sized rooms with good decor. Staff very friendly and helpful.  I had a couple of issues firstly after parking car in multi storey car park you then walk over a bridge and then have to squeeze down the thinnest escalator with all your luggage to get to the lobby. There was no lift or stairs that I could see. I am a fit person and I had difficulty with 2 bags. If I was elderly or disabled you would have real trouble.  Next all be it minor I have never been to a hotel where they do not supply shower gel. They had shampoo hair conditioner and body lotion but no shower gel. I asked the cleaning staff and was told that was the policy. So I had to go out to buy some after a late arrival.
50,First time at this hotel. The service was great . Everyone was very friendly. The casino is very clean. The location is excellent and the staff knew of nightclubs and bars around the area. Will definitely stay here next time
40,Mirage is the perfect low cost option for staying on the strip. Its location makes it really easy to get to anywhere else on the strip. The amount of plants on the property make this location very cool to walk around and not feel like your just standing in the sun.
40,"Enjoyed staying at the Mirage Hotel. It wasn't as overwhelming as some of the other Hotels on the strip. Everything within the hotel was in 5 minutes walking distance from your hotel room.  The patrons of the hotel/casino were ""regular"" people. People who didn't want to break the bank while on vacation but knew how to behave themselves. There were several restaurants with various price points to accomodate every persons budget. A 20% discount is applied to the diner bill at the buffet for hotel guests at the Mirage.  Do not get sticker shock at the prices listed on the menu for the deli. A single sandwich is meant to be shared. We could not finish the side order of fries we had purchased. If someone can eat the whole sandwich and a side order they deserve a tee-shirt!  Liked the location on the strip. When you paid for parking your pass was honored at the other MGM properties.  One disappointment was the amount of the discount applied to the Siegried and Roy/ Dolphin attraction. My opinion is that guests staying at the property should be offered a larger discount for this attraction."
50,We visited LV for 4 nights and stayed at the mirage. The hotel is very comfortable an welcoming! We stayed in the stay well rooms on the 12th floor which is like a kind of spa with mood lightning 2 king beds and a machine that cleans the air around you. The rooms were very clean and staff throughout the hotel were amazing and friendly! I would highly recommend the hotel! It’s in the middle of the strip and lots to do in and out of the hotel! Make sure you watch the volcano erupt from 9pm outside the hotel!
10,The customer service was atrocious. I pre-registered and spoke with someone there who advised me my room would be ready upon arrival. (This was important as I needed to be prepared for a meeting). When I arrived the pre-check in (automated) did not work. The front desk told me my room would not be available for a few hours. After finally getting into the room the temperature was unbearably hot. I turned the AC down as low as possible but this didnt help. They claimed to have engineering repair it. After attending a conference meetings and dealing with the mirage frustrations and went back to my room and it was still hot. The front desk told me they repaired it and to turn the ac down (obviously). They said the temperature wont go down for at least 30 minutes because it's motion activated. I was exhausted and gave up.
30,Like the Mirage. Very comfortable. Nice staff good restaurant choices (although we would like them to stay open a bit later) good entertainment choices and the pool is nice ( wish the chairs had a bit more space between them. They pack you in). The cabanas are too overpriced. Rooms need updating but are spacious.
20,I’ve been to Vegas at least 25 times. I’ve stayed at many of the Casinos. I’ve never stayed at the Mirage but based on its location it’s pool and the great reviews on Trip Advisor I chose it this time. Checking in I noticed how dirty and beat on the entrance looked. I was a little more hopeful at check in the woman who helped us was great. When we got up to our room it seemed nice but it had a weird smell. The bathroom was small and beat up. The tub had a big rust spot. The pool which was a key reason I stayed there was not very nice. The water was cloudy. There was garbage all over the place from empty cups etc. even band aids and cigarette butts. The hot tubs were cold and the jets barely worked. The casino needs a refresh as well it is not very welcoming. The kicker was my last evening at the Mirage. I came back to my room and noticed a strong smell of marijuana by my room door. I got in my room and my whole closet smelled like someone had smoked a joint in there. I had to take my clothes out of there. I called the desk and got some lady arguing with me that they could do nothing to stop people smoking pot in their rooms. Such great customer service. Pot is legal however there is NO WAY that somebody else’s closet should be smelling like a pot dispensary when their neighbor is smoking. THAT’S A HUGE PROBLEM. In CO hotels charge big fee’s for people who smoke pot in their hotel rooms. If you have any standards don’t stay here
50,5th trip to Las Vegas and the Mirage Hotel. The trip was a get away from work break my wife and I desperately needed. Everyone in the hotel restaurant and Casino were so friendly and pleasantly helpful.
50,Amazing facilities and wonderful staff made this a great week long stay for my father and I. Will definitely be back to enjoy the casino and see another show (Beatles Love is fantastic!) Also check out the Heritage Steak House the wait staff there is at the top of their game and the food was exquisite.
20,I am allergic to cigarette smoke. The hotel lobby allows smoking. To get to your room you must walk through the casino where everyone appears to be lighting up. Smoking should be restricted to outdoors at a minimum. In this day and age of awareness it is hard to believe that it is allowed
50,Love the location close to everything. Pool is right by the elevators don't have to cross the whole casino in the swimsuit to get to the pool. Everything is within reach. M life rewards desk is close to the elevators as well. It's hase been our 5 stay at Mirage and love it every time. And we love the pool more than in any other hotel.
40,Very very long check in lines not enough staff we were hungry and tired  We tried self check in but it would not work because we used Expedia the hotel should note this and we are M Life members  Rooms were awesome weird smell in the rooms however - chemical fragrance not pleasant plus toxic -
20,The check out process took over one hour because we asked for assistance. They took the luggage to the storage area even though the car was waiting. They could not bring it directly to the car. Will not be returning.
20,Book a room at the Mirage several months in advance signed up for early mobile check in....room not ready until after 8pm and not clean! In order to even get a room needed to get the hotel manager involved. He offered a $75 room credit....then got us in a room. Room was dirty hair in sink and bathtub floor in bathroom dirty. Called and asked for a late check out was charged $99. Go figure! Would not recommend or stay at the Mirage you have lots of other options.
30,Had 2 rooms. One was very nice as it had been remodeled. Second was a room overlooking volcano at a higher cost. Looked like a room from the seneties in desperate need of remodeling. Don't eat at the buffet. Very disappointing. Dinner average and breakfast almost inedible. Prices high within the hotel. $5 bottle for small coke.
40,Our overall stay was very nice but we had two problems that weren't pleasant...  First our check in was delayed almost four hours because the room wasn't ready. We were told to come back every hour and it was finally finished after the fourth hour. After a long travel day that was the last thing we needed.  Secondly during check out we were asked how we enjoyed the VIP Lounge. We had no idea that we had access to a VIP Lounge. We were never informed on check in. Apparently we should have been told and shown where it was. We definitely would have used the lounge had we known.  Aside from those few things our experience was very good. Friendly staff great food and beautiful pool!
30,I have stayed at the Mirage before with great satisfaction however a few changes this time around caught me off guard. Overall the stay was nice but there are now almost no waitresses on the casino floor or at the pool. People around us were getting very annoyed as were we with the lack of drink service. Some waitresses would simply run past and ignore us. The other strange change is the room service. It now comes in a bag...like take out. Were were missing items and once we called and the waiter came back up all the food was cold. We decided to not order room service again considering the cost and what we got for it. Otherwise it was a fine stay.
30,Booked 5 night stay with King Size Bed/Room...Upon arrival not avail had to settle for Double Queen Room Front Desk Staff not helpful in resolution. The room we did stay in was very clean no Coffee in room. Best Restaurant in hotel was the Cravings.
10,The room smelled like mold the check in lines were aweful. There was no customer service rep available to assist with any questions. When I was gambling there was no waitress in sight to offer me a drink. I ordered a rollaway bed and it didn’t come until 6 hours later. Overall the worst experience I have ever had and the room was not cheap.
50,I’ve stayed at TI Rio New York Caesar’s Paris ariaPlanet Hollywood. It was the best out of all of them. Playable tables fun atmosphere great mobile checkin to skip long lines bed was comfy room was awesome and great location on the strip. Will stay again
50,Everything about the trip was perfect. Customer service stood out big time!!!! The staff took time to get to know you. Not many items to complain about. I feel like they just need one more food option of a grab and go type deal
50,Great hotel....little pricey on the rooms for the value.......resort fees are ridiculous...if it wasn't for that everything was very good......Atmosphere is Awesome......service in rooms was Examplary...Dealers were good...bars nice center bar little slow and not very friendly...otherwise others very good....Still and Piano Lounge....Amazing
30,Mirage needs to fix the property. Suites are showing their age. Food in the buffet has changed and not for the better. May be part of the MGM2020 deal....too many mistakes. Wish MGM would just focus on taking care of the client and everything else will fall into place. This nickel and diming for parking resort fees cutting services is just silly. Accountants are running the show and they don't get it at all.
50,The Mirage was a virtual gem for this slot player. check-in was fast. The aquarium behind the reception desk is captivating. I went to the Mirage to gamble. I play about 15 different machines and the casino had all of them plus a couple of new ones I enjoyed. There was good security friendly staff and good circulation so it never felt stuffy even in smoking areas. Food in the Buffet and Pantry was good. The Buffet is very military friendly with a 50% discount and prices are reasonable by Vegas standards. The buffet had a good selection and a lot of sea food. I loved the turkey. My suite was spaceous with his and hers bathrooms. There was an express elevator from my suite on the 25th floor to the lobby. i don't think I ever waited more than 30 seconds for the elevator. Looking forward to going back.
50,This casino has always been my favorite. The location is perfect the place is always super clean. The pool area is nice. The beds are super comfy. I highly recommend you stay here and use the mobile check in. Easy to use and quick.
10,No coffee makers no frig no microwave. Pool closes at 7 PM yes 7PM!! In VEGAS!! I reserved a king bed room when I arrived I got 2 queen. I paid $3.50 for a banana yes 1 fruit. It's crazy. The cleaning staff
50,Although it's one of the older properties at this prime area of the Strip we were pleasantly surprised at how updated the rooms & common areas are… very good value for the price. Staff was very friendly. Will return!
50,Staying at the Mirage was an amazing experience. The cost was reasonable and the rooms were very clean nice and quiet. The staff was friendly and helpful. The pool is great. The other guests were friendly and polite.
30,This review makes me sad. My husband and I LOVED the actual hotel in terms of the theming the staff the restaurant choices and the location on the strip but if the rooms don’t cut it then this just won’t work for us in the future.    Our room was on the 24th floor which was nice because you get your own private elevator to that and the 25th floor. That means no crowded elevator rides! Our view was awesome because we could see the pool dolphins and the strip - basically everything you could want to see. I also really enjoyed the modern styling of the room and how clean everything was. The bed and pillows were also thankfully comfortable as we had been having bad luck with that lately on our vacations.    But now to the kickers for us. The first thing that instantly knocks a whole star off for me is when there are no charging options on either side of the bed. I’m used to seeing maybe only one side of the bed getting a charging dock of some sort but neither side had that in our room which is just a no no for me.    The other issue we had was the noises coming out of the bathroom all night. Out of nowhere the sinks and/or toilet would make LOUD gurgling noises as if they were draining. It scared us awake the first time we noticed and we had to close the door to shut out the sound. I’m also not sure if it had anything to do with the high temps outside but our room never got truly comfortable. It was very close to being the coolness I wanted but never quite got there.    Lastly the showers were teeny tiny. I kept bumping into the door (which didn’t seal closed all the way) and the wall of the shower. The same happened to my husband.    We are so bummed that the rooms were a let down because we loved the property itself. However for the types of rooms we’ve had in terms of size and amenities it doesn’t make sense to stay here when we can have the same property amenities elswhere but with better rooms. It was fun to try it out but didn’t beat our favorites.
50,The rooms are great. We got assistance as soon as we called. The food available is really good and the service at the front desk is really good. Everyone was in a great mood and ready to answer any questions.
10,Our room was a mess the headboard was torn in several places the air did not work. When I called to the desk to ask about another room I was told the only option was to have someone come in and fix the air and repair the headboard- but they had no idea when someone would come to the room or for how long. I asked to change rooms and was told no... This was one of the worst hotel stays I have experience- and SO expensive!!
20,I travel often for business and found that 1) the room had no coffee maker a deal breaker for me and 2) the mattress was just OK not great. I did like the larger than normal size of the room with large windows. The best part was the relatively short distance from the hotel to the adjoining conference center.
50,Got a great deal for this place. Nice and clean! Super friendly and right on the strip! Loved how close everything was and really enjoyed the pool! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone! Great!
40,Not often can my husband and I say the accessibility of the handicapped room was perfect. In this case we can. The location of the property was right in the center of all the action. We easily walked everywhere.
40,Nice hotel. Not so gigantic as sone. Excellent location on strip to walk to most entertainment. Nice little bars that don’t seem so isolated. The did an excellent job with business meeting I was at. Rooms were clean.
50,This was my 1st time staying at Mirage and all I have to say is this was probably the most amazing stay at any MGM property. From the valet at check in to the Valet at check out and EVERYTHING in between. The hotel is very clean rooms are amazing casino is inviting and restaurants are terrific. My only disappointment was that self parking is no longer free but most of the hotels self parking now aren't
20,So many better properties. Outside of the location there is no need for you to waste your time here. Find something else you will thank me later. Food is overpriced and mediocre at best. Service is poor even worse on the Casino floor. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere. Trust me!
50,Everything about this hotel exceeded my expectations. Location could not be better staff courteous and attentive the rooms were large and very clean. I can not speak any higher of the beds ( so comfortable). The hotel itself was clean with excellent gaming and affordable poker tournaments. The cravings buffet had everything you could imagine. Overall if I went back to Vegas this would be my choice again 100% of the time. Thanks Mirage for a wonderful base for our holiday.
40,The Mirage is conveniently located in the heart of Las Vegas Blvd. Close proximity to Cesars Harrahs Venetian etc. The hotel staff was very friendly and professional. The decor in the lobby and thru out the hotel was truly amazing. Rooms are nice and clean housekeeping makes sure that your room meet your standards. I definitely would recommend the Mirage to anyone planning on visiting Vegas in the near future.
40,Very clean room. Great location. Very walkable. Buffet for breakfast was subpar. I wouldn’t eat there again. It definitely was more focused on other food. Nice pool and easy to navigate lobby. Not super smoky.
50,We usually stay at the Mirage. The rooms are quiet. Security checks room keys after 10 PM to assure that people who are using the elevator are actually staying on the property. Don't use the minibar though it is VERY overpriced.
10,If you stay here you will have to get up and get dressed to get a cup of coffee in the morning or pay $15 for a box of coffee from room service and you have no fridge so no cold water or any other cold storage. You have to rent a fridge. If you take any medications that require one or the other think ahead. I don't mind spending money but when I am on vacation I would prefer a nice cup of coffee in the morning without having to leave the room or pay $15 for a box of coffee I would have to waste. I drink 1 cup not 5!
20,Booked room through conference site on Mirage and was supposed to receive a conference room discount. When asked I was told the discount was applied. However the Mirage website prices were the same as what I was charged.
50,We like the Mirage for a variety of reasons including location quality and mostly exceptional service. From the beautiful entry and atrium the Casino the restuartants the gorgeous pool and the theaters and the views from very nice rooms all is quality. And the employees have all been very nice to us.
10,Circa 1970 style room decor- room was dirty air conditioning did not work correctly. Check in is a 30 minute wait in line and the same when you leave. The fact that smoking is permitted should be clearly identified at registration.
50,Room was resort king. Had been comped 2 of the 3 nights. Service this year was exceptional. It is an older property but didnt matter. The people working made it a great experience. Absolutely no complaints or regrets. The Mirage staff took care of us like we were high rollers...above and beyond in every interaction.
20,beds are horrible rooms are dated. food is expensive and not good quality except cpk. they have no kid menu options so not good for family's even though kids everywhere. slots only take money no chance of winning. and additional charges added when paid everything in advance. great location very pretty view pool is nice and dolphin exhibit is fun.
30,Room not clean and had to stand in line again to get issue solved...not 5 star hotel service as billed in their description. People make mistakes but how the hotel make customer feel better after is what differentiate good vs bad service.
40,No fridge to keep food cool or microwave to warm up leftovers unless you wanna pay $35 per day. There is a fridge filled with over priced items that you cant move without being charged. The food was average for the price. $17 for a cheeseburger that does not include fries.
30,Just returned from a conference and the following were of excellent rating: 1. The room was clean bed comfortable. 2. The pool was cleanrefreshing  comfortable chairs.  However what was disappointing was:  1. Gym closed at 7pm and had to pay an extra resort fee. closed way to early.  2. Would have liked a coffee machine in the room so I could have used that money i spent at Starbucks at the casino.  3. Also could not use the refrigerator was told at check in it is not for personal use and if i did  there would be a charge.  I am not sure if i would return based on the above.
50,I was staying for a conference in March that was being held across the street at the venetian.  It was my first time staying at the mirage and I will be back in September again.  Pros  Smaller casino meaning less getting lost  Service was great  Room was clean and modern  Centrally located on the strip so you’re close to everything  Caesar’s and Venetian shopping/ restaurants walking distance    Cons  Smaller rooms but it’s a hotel oh well I didn’t spring for a huge room  Food selection was limited but the Carnegie Deli makes up for it. The rest was just okay. Fortunately great places nearby since everything is walking distance.
10,Ok this was the worst experience that I have ever had in Vegas. Upon arrival they did not have our room type that we ordered. She put us in an adaptation room with a broken shower and the bed so low that it had messed up my back. I had to argue for 3 days to finally get to a manager and get the credits that I had been promised.
20,The “glitzy” hotel is simply a Mirage. The room appointments housekeeping and restaurants need to be better supervised and monitored. This hotel should use “mystery” guests to identify the problems and help management get focused on guest satisfaction and quality. I understand that the casino drives business for the Las Vegas hotels but this hotel need to examine the total guest experience.
10,If you want a hotel where they put you in a room with someone else's puke and no functioning air conditioning- this is your spot! The staff is rude they don't apologize for moving you rooms twice in 2 days- the worst experience ever. Spend the extra $20 and stay at the WAY nice Venetian!
50,We visited here during our trip to Vegas this year. Had the most amazing time here. Rooms were huge and the bathroom was great.    They had an ironing board and a hairdryer which was super handy for a UK visitor!    Pool was fab with towels already supplied for the sunbeds. It’s great as they have waitresses going around so you can order drinks whilst you’re sunbathing.    Great location on the strip and make sure you check out the volcano which I think erupts at 8pm 9pm and 10pm every evening!
50,Nice property. Clean guest rooms and very helpful housekeeping staff. Convenient restaurants and the convention rooms are convenient and an easy walk.  The front desk personnel were very helpful with the check in process.
50,The mirage is a stunning hotel. Wonderful food options and a beautiful pool! The convention space was a perfect size and a great layout. Pricing at the bars and restaurants were pretty high but the quality was great!
40,Business trip. Nice place great location. Only thing missing was food court for a quick bite and faster coffee or room coffee maker (Starbucks were both quite busy in am). Comfortable. Shows (Terry Fator and Cirque de Soleil Beetles) were awesome!
30,Terrible room for the money we gambled and spent over 4 days. I would rather pay for the room in a different resort next trip than getting this kind of complimentary room. Definitely changing our resort next trip.
50,Great time as always at The Mirage!! Casino has a great vibe and fun dealers. We had a blast! Dont forget to head over to Paradise Restaurant by the pool and ask for Toti to be your server...he's great.    This trip we got a room with a pretty small bathroom but otherwise the rooms were everything we need.
40,Everything was great. The only thing is the rooms do not have a mini fridge to put left over food nor a coffee maker. Also the restaurants in the hotel closed kind of early. What’s great is the casino area doesn’t smell  Overwhelmingly of smoke.
20,I brought a group of friends and family to celebrate my daughters 21st birthday. We checked in on Wednesday at 11:30 pm. I had booked 4 rooms under my daughter-in-laws M rewards program. When we tried to check in we were told two of the rooms were unavailable. We had booked these rooms 4 months in advanced and had received two confirmations of our reservations. Management was requested but denied and were told they were too busy. When we demanded to be given the rooms I had paid for we were told that we would have to wait for them to be cleaned. At least we finally got what we paid for and had reserved. Unfortunately they were not on the same floor but beggars can’t be choosers. Once in the rooms we noticed there wasn’t a small fridge. Someone in our party told us we could rent them. So much for chilled water and drinks. Even motel 6 has fridges provided in their rooms. Not a great start to our vacation but we managed. Beds were comfortable and rooms are tastefully done but when you are frustrated from the beginning it’s difficult to enjoy the standard amenities.  The choices of places to eat within the casino are limited after 1:00am and before 5:00 pm. Best to walk across the street to the Venetian where there are tons of choices.  The casino is clean and the cigarette smoke is minimal which I appreciated. Floors were very uneven throughout the casino.  Be sure to buy water or else drink from the tap. Warm bottled water in the room is $18.  Our group made the best of things but I won’t be staying at the Mirage again. It’s the little things that make a stay more pleasurable and the Mirage definitely lacks in the little things.
30,I don't think these rooms have been updated since the place opened. It was clean but for the money would much rather stay at another of the many hotels to choose from. The staff was very good in The Pantry restaurant. The other outlets not impressed at all.
10,Our stay at Mirage on June 10th was ruined by a serious water leak from a light fixture above the bath tub; you could have taken a shower with someone else's waste water from the room above. Overall the room needs a renovation. The manager tried to compensate the unwated shower experience by waiving the resort fees and free meal voucher and Dolphin entrance tickets but yet I could have stayed at much newer place for the same price and regret the hotel choice for this trip. If you want to enjoy Las Vegas don't stay at Mirage.
50,The 2 bedroom penthouse was bigger than my apartment and offered a great view of the volcano and strip.  While the livingroom furniture was stiff and uncomfortable and there is no coffee maker it was great for a fun get away with two couples.  The pool is so much fun!
50,Through My Vegas we got a complimentary night and it was very good. The hotel is very big but it doesn't feel as big as other places. The check in area had a big fish tank and the atrium is like a tropical forest. There was no waiting for elevators like other hotels which is nice. We got a standard king room and it was very nice and clean. The room was nicely decorated and very bright. We had a pool and strip view which was lovely. The bathroom was on the smaller side but the shower was good and it was clean so no complaints there. We only had to pay resort fees and a refundable incidental fee. My vegas really does work and is woth the time and effort. The pool was huge but on the cold side but the hot tubs made up for this. Overall we would definitely stay here again as it is a lovely hotel that does not feel outdated in the slightest.
30,I am very disappointed also from the way you conduct this survey. Asking the same questions again and Gain as if I am to change my opinion about the service I got this time. This is the first time I am having this awful experience with you.
40,Enjoyed a quick trip hotel is older and large very spread out. Location is right in the middle of the strip. Staff is friendly. Pool is nice lots of kids and still smoke inside. Not amazing and not underwhelming just ok.
50,The location of the hotel is perfect. Meals at the restaurants were a bit expensive but great quality and taste. Staff onsite were very friendly and helpful. I enjoyed my first time in Vegas and would stay there again.
30,Visiting for CMSA Conference in room 20099. I wasn’t impressed. I paid for a King Room with a Strip View but ended up getting the back of the building overlooking the pool. The rooms/hotel needs updating. Doors were thin so you hear everything (especially the intoxicated people returning).The bed was uncomfortable. I did see left behind hair on the bathroom floor. Other than that it appeared clean. The pool was beautiful. I hate I didn’t get a chance to enjoy it. The buffet wasn’t bad either. I even enjoyed the 24/7 dining service although it is wayyyyy over priced. Other pros include the access to other shops restaurants etc. It’s across the street from a Walgreens and a 10 minute walk to Fashion Show Mall and Planet 13...
50,It was a wow!!! Experience for me and my mom! The room was clean and comfortable.we didn’t have to go anywhere else to eat! The mirage had a lot of restaurants to choose from. And u can Be a trainer for a with the Dolphins! Now that was really awesome! It’s worth the 500$! the food was awesome! I had the best breakfast sandwich have ever had in my life! WOW it was worth the 18$! And the pool was awesome! I will return!
50,Friends and I come to Vegas once a year and make it a point to stay at The Mirage. It has become our Vegas home.  The Mirage is a great combination of reasonable prices and top-notch amenities and it's convenient to the places on the Strip we like to go.
30,Stay was just meh! Rooms need maintenance and updating.Don’t comp the crappy rooms that are leftovers. Why do loyal good customers get subpar rooms just because they spent enough on prior occasions to get a free room? Check in lines are long and there are not enough agents.
50,I love staying at the Mirage. It's easy check in easy parking and so relaxing. I really enjoy the inside gardens and the whole ambiance of the casino. The check in staff are always very nice which is always a bonus especially when arriving at 2am!
40,Location can't be beat very clean. The resort is pricey and if you open the fridge (mini bar) or move the snacks you will be charged per the front desk. No coffee pot fridge or microwave in rooms- a venti mocha at the on property Starbucks was 8.45.
50,This was my second time staying at the Mirage. (first time was over 10 years ago). It was still as nice as I remember. Everything was well kept and clean. It didn't even look outdated. Check in was quick and welcoming. Fortunately we were able to checkin early but we didn't get a good view bc we got what was available at the time. We had no problem with that. The room was clean and comfortable with everything we needed. We had brunch in the Cravings restaurant. Everything was delicious! We also got to eat at the Still. On Tuesdays they have all you can eat street tacos and margaritas for just under $30. Definitely worth it. Delicious tacos and nice and strong margaritas. There is a food truck in the back that you order from and they bring you your food. The food came out pretty quick. Their guacamole was really good too. Staff here was awesome. The pool area is also nice to hang out. It is actually a really good size poo and lots of chairs available. I did get to check out the Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat. It was neat to see the dolphins so close. Siegfried happened to be in the Secret Garden while I was there so that was neat. But I do have to admit there wasn't a lot to do especially for the price to get in. Overall we had a wonderful time at this hotel. We really did enjoy our stay here and the location is great. We will definitely return.
50,I love going to Vegas. Every time is like the first time as far as fun goes. Staying in a clean comfortable hotel located in the middle of everything is important. The Mirage is the hotel of choice. Clean friendly service and many styles of dining. If you stay in the right place and you leave refreshed you are a winner.
20,Great restaurants nice casino & fun pool areas. Easy access to the tram and easy to find UBER pick up areas. The room was ok. Bathroom didn’t fell or look clean - caked on dust and mold in the shower. I rarely saw any staff but the few I encountered didn’t enhance my experience in anyway.
50,This is our 4th time staying here at the Mirage stayed at other hotels This hotel is very clean and lots to do. Stayed 7 nights would strongly recommend it’s close to other casinos restaurants lots to choose from. Can’t wait to go back the pool was amazing.
50,We had a wonderful time at the mirage hotel the front desk gentleman was very concerned that it was our anniversary and seemed like he really cared gave us a wonderful view and a wonderful room from there forward the trip got better and better good job
50,From the smell of coconut when you walk in and the tropical feel to the friendly staff to that beautiful baby dolphin Carlie the Mirage was everything we were looking for to help celebrate my birthday weekend!
30,I have been to Vegas several times. This time was for a conference. It was my first time staying at the Mirage. The hotel lacks the glam that is always being talked about. There are few restaurants and less shopping. The only plus side is the shop Karma and Luck. The sales people are helpful and the items were nice. Bliss Yogurt was great and reasonably priced. Finally my room service was served hot and timely as well as being cheaper than if I went to the restaurant.
30,Great hotel back in the day. The hotel needs to be updated. Sports book is highly recommended. California Pizza kitchen was delicious. Carnegie Deli provides large sandwiches that taste great no sides come with sandwich.
50,Booked in here for 10 nights. Got upgraded to the 24th floor with a volcano view. Hotel is fabulous and the dining and pool areas great. Had a few issues but Brittany at the front desk was great and sorted them out. The location is great and i would definitely recommend.
40,Wonderful Hotel with plenty of foliage inside and out.The pool is beautiful with lounge chairs for everyone.The buffet was good but the food was not very hot.There is a Tram connecting you to Treasure Island for a change of scenery.Centrally located to the other attractions on the strip.
50,The Mirage is a terrific hotel located in the heart of the strip. The pool is one of the best in Vegas. It’s a tropical oasis. The hotel has just the right mix of bars and restaurants to make a great night out.
50,Well organized polite staff and clean comfortable setting made for a great location for a National convention. Short wait for food service compared to other years in other locations where we could wait for an hours just to get seated. Excellent staff!
10,This hotel had me leave a $200 security deposit. They charged me for things I did not get and kept the full $200. When I call to get a find out about the unexpected charges I only get a recorded voice. I will not be back.
50,This Hotel went beyond my expectations.  Pool is the best in Las Vegas!!!  But really it was the staff at this Hotel that made our stay so great. Every where we went pool rhumbar casino buffet M life desk concierge front desk etc the staff were super friendly and helpful. I can't enough good things about the staff.  The rooms weren't super fancy like other hotels in Vegas but were definitely clean and comfortable.  Location is perfect as it's almost right in the middle of the strip. Hope to come back real soon. Thank you to all the staff at The Mirage!!!!
10,Credit was given for food and beverage at all restaurants in hotel. Not until after did I find out this was incorrect. Took two phone calls and emails to actually find out that they don't all count. Not to mention they don't put any charges on your bill so how are you supposed to know.
40,Spent 3 nights in June 2019 at the Mirage for a convention. Rooms were spacious and well appointed. Bathroom was a little tight. Pool and other amenities were plentiful. Cannot beat the location right in the center of the Strip.
40,Went to vegas had the pleasure of staying at the Mirage. Great from when i check in to the time i checked out. the staff are great there when you need help. we had a vip host that took care of use. Had a great time at there pool Bare.
20,Totally disappointed with our stay here. We paid an extra $150/night at check in for a 2 bedroom suite with volcano view. That was a joke - we only saw the glass dome and roof of the Mirage. Bathroom floor sloped tv and lights not working when we arrived. Took 3 trips to 3 different people to get our F&B credit and the way our bill is printed I still don't know if we ever received it? With many options to choose from the Mirage will not be my first choice again. Hotel just looks tired.
40,Overall favorable experience. All personnel were very friendly and helpful. Television connection in the room came and went draperies were not working at the closure. I did enjoy the hot shower with an excellent nozzle for massage.
50,Had a great stay at the Mirage. Would recommend to others and would definitely stay there again. Clean and staff was friendly. If you get a chance definitely check out the Secret Garden. If you do a VIP tour it's even better.
30,As frequent travelers to the Mirage Hotel and Casino it appears to be going down hill with each stay. The rooms are beginning to be in need of repair and renovation. We love the pool and the restaurants but the rooms are very disappointing!
30,Checking out was horrible. Britney was not helpful at all. Didn’t try to help at all made us feel like we wanted to complain to get money back. Yet we were being charged for self parking and valet parking
50,We are gold members. The check in experience was very good the room provided was average but clean and quick access from casino. The size of the casino was perfect lots of different gaming options. Location was very good to shopping and other casinos. California Pizza was great Carnegie Deli not so much. When you order at counter they ask if you want to leave a tip for the server based on total bill. We did and should have waited she wasn't attentive to our needs. Overall I would recommend staying here.
30,The room we booked was not available at check in. We had issues checking out also and they charged us a late check out fee. Other than that the food was good and the pool was very relaxing. The staff was polite.
10,My husband & I haven't had a couples trip for 12 years since my son was born. I decided to book us a couples trip to LV for our 20th Wedding Anniversary and chose the Mirage as I have yet to stay there. I book a King Volcano room at an additional expense over a month in advance & checked in 24 hours in advance.    1st - The room I booked wasn't available & given a 2 queen volcano room.  2nd - The next morning was woken up at 5am by a loud strange sound from the bathroom. Went to look and water coming down from the upstairs room around the light fixture into the bathtub. I called down & was told it's not concern and engineering will be sent. Annoyed and couldn't sleep went to front desk. Was told it was a concern & they'll send engineering up right away. Two hours later - needing to take shower and not inclined to use the one in our room went back to front desk. Front desk apologetic and agreed to move our us right away. Was sold on a Well Stay room - newly remodeled - $4000 beds a better room than what we had but crappy view of the city. I needed a shower and wanted to enjoy our trip and not have to wait so I took it.    The Well Stay room was about the same as our other room or worse - The updates really didn't make it better - both my husband and I didn't sleep well. We had to sleep on smaller bed and we were both very uncomfortable and did NOT much rest at all. We did less than what we wanted to do.
50,We recently stayed at Mirage. The service food and gaming was fantastic. The pool and poolside service was incredible. We need to return and try more of the food offerings. Every person was geared to making our experience unforgettable
40,Hotel was nice but sort of expensive rooms need an upgrade and are tired. The hotel was super nice with lots of amenities and the casino was fun. Drinks were ridiculously expensive as well. The location is one of the best features since it was centrally located.
10,Very bad service im so upset I would never stay there... our room was never clean we called multiple times and no one never came to clean our even though we called multiple times. I feel really disappointed i was also charged extra as a mistake
10,Stayed here maybe 3 or 4 different times . so I talked 8 of us into all staying here. We all had to switch rooms at least one time. Because of smells or broken showers. First night it was 102 outside and my ac stoped working. . Mlife comped me 3 rooms then desided to only give me 2 of them
10,"We had planned on a happy get away to Vegas for an anniversary celebration. We thought we would try a hotel we had not yet stayed in and because the show we reserved was in the Mirage we booked there. Of couse we were aware of the sizable resort fee add on. But decided to splurge for this special occasion. Whem we arrived at checkin time we were met by very long lines slow service and a new policy that was not included on line or in any of our reservation documents. Their ""new"" policy was to charge hotel guests 15 dollars every day of your stay plus 15 dollars every time you use your car to go anywhere. Mind this was not valet parking but just old find some spot on your own in their old parking lot. Since we were checking in we had no choice but to go along with this although we did protest that this was not made public ahead of time. The manager shrugged and assigned us the lowest 2nd floor room  I guess in retaliation for our complaint. We had to go to someone else to get it changed to a floor we had paid for and expected. Yhen whenever we tried to use our room key to get in and out of their lot as instructed it never worked. So we were forced to wait till a human being could override their flawed system. We also found several other instances in our room and in the hotel that clearly demonstrated the Mirage management thinks nothing of adding meaningless excessive charges to their guests bill with no prior reveal and no respect for their guests budget or most reasonable expectations and comfort. It seems they were content with only sending a form letter reply to our concerns. We would heartily discouage anyone from staying at the Mirage or parking there. You can easily park across the street at Treasure Island if you need to see something at the Mirage instead. Having travelled throughout this country we have stayed in hundreds of hotels. The treatment of guests here is by far the worse we have seen We don't know why anyone would want to support this greedy and unethical hotel!"
30,II have mixed feeling with this hotel. Perfectly located great room good bath clean good dining options good gym; great pool but to go to your room you have to go through the casino; and the casino smells like a mixture of cigarette with Febreeze. It hit me everytime I entered the area either from my room or coming in from the street. Further all restaurants are facing the casino so I was getting that smell even in the restaurants. I got it for $155/night + $30 resort fee which given the amenities is good value. If you have a sensitive nose like mine it might not be a good option. Also I left my phone charger in the room when I checked out and housekeeping never turned it to lost and found.
50,For our 50th class reunion we asked class members if they would like to meet in Vegas. 10 couples signed up and we had a wonderful stay at the Mirage. All the employees gave great service and made us feel welcome. We liked the LVB Burger restaurant in the Mirage and the location was perfect for the activities we planned.
30,Our first visit to Las Vegas. It's on the strip which has a lot of different things you can do. The Mirage room we stayed in was okay. No free coffee or tea in room or hotel. When playing the slots I was never offered free drinks even though I had their M Life card. Went into other casinos on the strip and compared. Don't spend extra on The Mirage it's just the same as any other casinos on the strip. The buffet is extremely disappointing. Not that great of food. Other restaurants are expensive for okay food. Just a casino to me. As a first time visitor I would not say it's something I have to return to.
40,"First the Good Points. Location excellent as right in middle of The Strip. Very Efficient valet parking (US$24 per night) huge room with 2 Queen beds good check in and check out number of places to eat within hotel.    Second the Not so Good Points. No free water in rooms no prices on minibar items (their answer was we keep changing the prices) having to walk through smoke filled casino to get to elevators and the ""Resort Fee"" of US$40 per night to cover Wifi concierge services printing boarding passes use of pool - just another way to make money. The erupting volcano was tired dated and poor."
50,We stayed at another resort but went to Mirage to play slots one afternoon and boy were we happy that we did. They have a great variety from old school machines to the latest high tech types. We played for three hours had a blast and actually came out ahead. There were lots of cocktail servers and all were very kind. The walk up to the front door was beautiful...such an oasis in LV with beautiful landscaping and waterfalls. Also checkout the huge fish tank behind the front desk...mesmerizing.
20,Amazing how poorly the room was kept. It was an upgraded room too! Won’t stay at that hotel again. THe public areas were nice. Says hotel doesn’t care about residents. Staff nice. We are auto upgrade members who identified ourselves and clearly made no impact. Too many great hotels in Las Vegas to stay there again. Heard from driver that old hotels don’t maintain rooms any more. Indicator to stay at newer hotels.
50,Very nice room and staff. Rooms almost free with life kanomi rewards. MGM is always the best value. Awesome pool lots of shade. Mall and Walgreens across the street. Great buffet with drinks included.
50,This has been my 15th year in a row that I have been to the mirage in June. I will continue to visit the Mirage because of the service the friendly staff and the location on the strip. The cabana at the pool is the perfect recipe for relaxation before eating at the heritage steakhouse and then attending the love show or the wonderful gaming floor.
50,The hotel is located perfectly in the middle of the strip so it is perfect for walking to the other hotels. The staff was all very pleasant and the restaurants were excellent. The Beatles Love show was awesome. A very pleasant stay.
20,Cheaper than the other hotels but I guess you get what you pay for. I probably won’t be back to Vegas but I DEFINITELY won’t be back to the Mirage. The food is terrible the pool bar is a rip off and the rooms are cramped.
40,The property needs a little improvement. Lighting and modern appurtenances would be a good start. Staff is excellent and over I like the Mirage. The on line check in and check out is great. The casino is dark and not inviting. Really needs a good face lift. Understand the need for darker carpet but what about the walls and ceilings? I’d also think a hard surface rather than carpet from check in to elevators would be good as you go through the casino. Rolling over carpet with luggage and wheel chairs could be made easier and more inviting.
30,Mirage is a well located hotel on the strip. The check in lines can be long and it’s constant. It’s super busy even in a Tuesday and just jammed with people everywhere.    When checking in they said they only had a twin bed for me so I asked about an upgrade. I paid $100 extra a night to get a 2 bedroom 1600 sq ft suite - you’d think that would be awesome right ? Well no.    The room is painfully dated. Literally no plus anywhere near the end. To charge your phone ISYS across the room. I asked the front desk and they said when the hotel was made in the 80s they didn’t need plugs. Ummmm..... the smart phone came out 15 years ago. Truth is that they get away with this and have never “needed” to send any capital to update the place.    The sofa was this plastic type fake leather. The tv was in a strange plexi glass case. Is it that valuable? Doubt it. All the plugs around the room are so old that your charger falls out- know what I mean?!??    Look if you want cheap tons of people and kinda out dated crappy rooms - Mirage is for you.    I will say the gym was really nice and the restaurants are newer and nicer.
30,Without question Rebecca Ackermann made this trip. Her customer service goes above and beyond. The food options are also great. LV Burger was excellent as was all the food we had at the Pantry. The best was Osteria Costa. Absolutely spot on service and delicious food.
30,Having read loads of negative reviews prior to our holiday I was really worried about what to expect when we checked in. There was no need to have worried at all we arrived at the hotel about 4.30pm on a Thursday to no queues we got a volcano view room as requested and were checked in very swiftly. Yes they do request $100 per night off a credit card for ‘incidentals’ and we we’re also warned about the sensors on the mini bar we never even opened the fridge and didn’t touch all the sweets etc on top and checked our bill daily through the TV just to make sure nothing had been added. Our room (22066) was spotless with a fab view of the volcano/strip/high roller there was loads of room for luggage etc and a free safe. The corridors were quiet throughout the night and the lifts were always quick. Although there were loads of eateries in the hotel we preferred to eat at the much cheaper establishments on The Linq promenade The Yard House was excellent value. As non smokers and asthmatics we did not have any problems with the air quality. All the staff we encountered during our stay were very helpful and always smiling. We never used the pool but it did look very busy very early. I would not have a problem staying here again and would also recommend it to family and friends.
50,The Mirage has wonderful restaurants high end steakhouse fresh and delicious Italian food and other restaurants depending on your cravings. The casino never seems stuffy or filled with cigarette smoke. The flowers and plants throughout the property are gorgeous and help to create a relaxing tropical feeling.
40,When you stay at the Mirage going to the O show was amazing. Almost worth staying there just for the show. Went on business with two other work associates and we were checking in separately and they upgraded us to stay together in a deluxe suite. Was classic
50,Great time. Good location. Hallway was colder then the room. Would have liked to have seen some $5 tables other then all tables being $10. Good choices on slots. Pool was fantastic. Restaurants were good. LVB good burger joint. Breakfast buffet and dinner buffet were above average.
40,Had an issue with the AC in my room. Maintenance came to fix it but the fix only lasted 24 hours. Frustrated I called the front desk at 1:30 am and Brittney was AMAZINGLY AWESOME in helping me by offering 3 different options to solve the problem BEFORE i asked anything. She is a ROCK STAR
40,Our all time favorite hotel here in Vegas is The Cosmopolitan but this time we decided to try The Mirage since we were only be staying for a few nights. The staff and the front desk was great-made is feel welcome and even gave us a free upgrade because our room type was over booked.  Rooms are roomy and clean trust me I always check for cleanliness. Restaurants are good and the coffee shop has great beverages. We would definitely stay here again.  The only improvement I would recommend is maybe having a wider choices fir in room dining.
30,We planned the normal Sunday through Thursday stay. Our flight back to Indianapolis on Thursday was cancelled by the airline. There were no available flights back Thursday so we had to stay another night. We asked Mirage if we could stay 1 more night in the same room we had. The room was the basic room nothing special. They said we could but would have to pay the normal room rate which was 210.00. We told them our issue about our flight and asked if we could get a lower rate. They said there was nothing they could do. After being loyal members of MGM and the MLIFE program I feel MGM/Mirage should have done more to help us out. If this would have been caused by our error i could have understood there reply. Why preach loyalty if your not. We had been having a great stay until this happened. They made us feel un-welcomed.
30,"So it seems acceptable that a hotel guest stands in line for 45 minutes just waiting to check in. Absolutely no urgency from the staff.  The room was OK but lined up against other properties we have stayed at in Vegas it was a bit underwhelming.  We did get good service from the bell-hop team on departure.  There were plenty of dining options but apart from the buffet wow everything was just so over-priced. so much so that we only ate ""in house"" on one occasion. Bars and cafes were also overpriced. I don't mind paying a premium for a 5 star property with 5 star service... unfortunately we didn't experience this at Mirage."
50,Service was fabulous. The restaurants have great food. The show love is incredible and the show of making love is even better. The spa is wonderful and I normally do not go to hotel spas Relaxing fun entertaining vacation
50,The Mirage is my kind of place. The staff are very friendly and the other guests are typically too. The typical guest is middle age or older so you don't have to deal with the younger and sometimes more obnoxious crowd you can find in Vegas. It is not expensive and $10 tables are the norm even on weekend evenings.
30,Our usual stay is at The Venetian or Bellagio. We decided to stay at the Mirage to save a little money. The casino was nice the service was good restaurants are pretty good location is great. The downside was the hotel room which was tired and needs a redo. Peeling headboard poor bathroom ventilation and small bathrooms. Yes I know...you get what you pay for.
50,Nice rooms Mlife ViP services are great and the slots are amazing the hotel staff are very helpful enjoyed my stay and will continue to stay great area the mirage is right across from the harrah's and walking distance to all the major hotels
50,We just took our daughter to celebrate her 21st. Had a great time playing table games & slots! Everyone was friendly and helpful. Enjoyed the variety of restaurants close by and shows. Look forward to coming back.
40,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Mirage as our first trip to Vegas. The pool area was one of the nicest I saw on the strip and the location on the strip was perfect as it was near the middle so you could explore both ends.  I do feel the rooms are a bit dated and tried and could do with a refurb but you don't go to Vegas to spend your time in the room so it didn't really bother us.  A good place to stay if you're a first timer to Vegas.  Also be aware you pay city tax on arrival so take extra money if you're a tourist
50,The service and staff was excellent. Cravings buffet was very great and had a lot to choose from. Make sure you sign up for M Life and use the valet service. It helps with discounts and rewards with other MGM resorts.
10,Hotel from hell!  The first room provided had a defective air conditioner and a 6 inch in diameter yellow stain in the bath tub  The second room that was provided had pubic hair in the bath tub and hair in the sink!  The staff at the front desk are incompetent such as Nicole and Giselle. I asked for a room on the quiet side and was given a room on the side where the train passes by in the night and blows its whistle very loudly!    I asked for partial payment of the billing to be charged to my company however if you ask them for anything out of the ordinary watch out! They cannot figure it out! It took over one hour to figure out and we had to get the manager involved in the matter. We missed our dinner reservations and had to find another place to go to dinner too!  Do NOT stay in this hotel I know I never will!
50,I had a great time at this hotel. The staff was very courteous and help full. House keeping was fast and dependable. It is a very clean hotel. No fridge in the rooms but not a major problem. Casino was great and so was the in hotel shopping.
20,I came back to the Mirage after 4 years of being away but now I totally regret it. I paid for a Queen Strip View room and found the carpet dirty and needing to replaced or shampooed. Our bathroom sink was clogged the first time Engineer came by and found out it was caused by room next door back up. Room is outdated the bed headliner had been repaired with a piece of clear packaging tape and the worse was the mold in the bathroom covered by caulking. No fridges or microwaves which then forces you to use the sink as a fridge. Cost for fridge $35 a night. One day the wind had kicked up outside and beer cans and trash left by pools edge had gotten into the pool but saw no one called to remove the trash guests were seen doing it. When I need to purchase a Gatorade I found the Essentials stores located inside the Mirage gouging guests their price for a small bottle was $5 dollar or 2 for $10 thats a 400% mark up. Its not cologne its Gatorade. I will not return EVER again until the place is renovated completely! Please spend your money elsewhere. Best of Luck!
40,It was my first time in Vegas and it was for a work conference. The location of the Mirage is great because it's conveniently on the strip. Staff was friendly and prompt. My room is always pristine no matter what time I come back. Their housekeepers are amazing.
50,First trip to Vegas and the Mirage did not disappoint! From the accommodations to the food to the shows they deliver! Looking for the best place in Vegas? Look no further than The Mirage. We will be back!
50,We stayed at the Mirage for the first time last week and it was WONDERFUL! Not only is in hotel gorgeous but the food options are great (LVB Burger was in particular phenomenal) the pool is amazing and the room was so clean and comfortable. The location is also good on the strip since it is in the middle. The great thing about the pool was that while it was very busy...the pool is so large that it didn't feel crowded. There was plenty of space in the pool. You also have to be a guest at the hotel to use it which helps prevent it from getting overly crowded as well. I would definitely stay here again my next trip to Vegas!
30,The hotel is nice and clean- great location and the room size was good. The Spa was the highlight. Def worth every dollar going to the spa for the day! Wished they had some more quick and easy takeout food options.
50,Love the Pool and the Dolphin/Pool Bar. The Servers are incredible! Jax Dave Daniel and Matthew know how to treat their guests!! The Pantry has the Best Blueberry Pancakes and Smash Browns!!! Love the Centralized Location
50,We were on our honeymoon and had our last few nights here. I have stayed at a few of the casinos but this was by far my favourite. The location was great. The room was large in size and clean. We were given a view of the stripe and could see the volcano. Staff were helpful and friendly. We had a free night via the my vegas app. We were also given discounts to the buffet. The hotel was busy with a lot going on which was great. The rooms were quiet however which was even better.
40,Not perfect but we were satisfied. Very clean and the daily cleaning was very thorough. Very expensive restaurants etc best to eat off the strip. Location was excellent. Pool very large but also gets really busy.
50,Super place to stay in Vegas. Everybody is knowledgeable friendly and helpful. From the erupting volcano to the Sigmund and Roy Gardens just a great place to stay. The staff gets to know you if you let them. The restaurants are the best and room we had was wonderful. And every time we came back to the room they had cleaned it perfect. We also had room service twice and it was fast and friendly and delicious. Just a great place to stay with an upbeat atmosphere.
50,Love this place!! We come to Vegas twice a year from Chicago and the Mirage has become our “Go-To” spot that we stay. They have a sweet pool awesome food great shows and fun places to drink. Keep it up!
10,We still have 7 days left of our 8 night honeymoon stay at the Mirage. I am writing this review whilst still a guest here!!! We were given an awful room moved to another this was just as bad. Stains on the bed what looked like human excrement on the curtains very shabby decor absolutely awful. The staff didn't seem to understand how upset this has made us very poor care and service. Will never ever stay again.
20,The Mirage is adequate you might really enjoy it if you want a dated interior unclean rooms and over priced amenities. Most of the staff is professional and courtesy; the casino staff nearly smile.
40,Let me first say we've been visiting Vegas 1-2 times per year for the past 10 years. The Mirage is a very nice resort and casino. The staff is very polite and the rooms are great. The day we were to check out our flight was cancelled by Southwest due to Air Traffic Control issues. We couldn't catch another flight the same day because they were full and had to wait till the following day to leave. We were hoping The Mirage could help us out with this issue. We asked if we could possibly stay another night at a reduced rate since this was out of our control. The staff at The Mirage told us we could stay but it would have to be at the regular nightly rate of 210.00. With not having any other options we were basically stuck. You would think after being a loyal customer of the MGM chain and of the MLIFE program for over 10 years they could have given us a better rate. We feel Mirage could've/should've done more to help us out. If this would have been our issue we could have seen we would be on our own. But this was out of our control. Apparently Loyal means nothing to some companies. Please stop promoting loyalty when you don't back it up.
30,Great location and staff but there were groups of young people staying 4 to 6 in a room who camn in early in the morning (2 am) and stood out in the hall slammed doors and generally made a racket. In fairness to them the doors are really noisy anyway. The rooms have no soundproofing. Will go somewhere higher end in future.
40,A great hotel slap bang in the middle of everything ‘ nice and clean with multiple eating places  always lots of sun beds whenever you went down to pool ... only downside no free fridge which is the first hotel I’ve ever been to that hasn’t had one .
50,Great hotel & Casino! Pool was great! Bring your kids for the Dolphin experience! Staff was excellent. Breakfast at Pancakes was delicious. I highly recommend the mirage for a Las Vegas vacation. You will enjoy it!
30,Stayed for 4 nights yet the room was only cleaned once. We weren't even provided with clean towels.  The bathroom needs renovating taking a shower felt like being shot at with a water canon and bath tub had rust in it. Not ideal.
50,The Mirage is one of MGM's older properties and as such is small enough that i don't need hiking boots to walk across the main floor or need a GPS to find the elevators to my room. People were friendly and ready to help at every turn.
40,Its a great place to stay while in Vegas..extremely grand and luxurious...with variety of cafes and restaurants available in the main lobby. You can also visit the McDonald's which is just outside of the main entrance...enjoyed their buffet as well
50,Stayed in the Mirage hotel for a week end of March through to April we stayed on floor 16 on the West tower of the hotel. Hotel itself is clean and decorated to a high standard. This hotel is situated in the middle of the strip next to ceasers palace. The hotel is huge and check in was pretty straight forward. Downstairs im the lobby is a massive casino and multiple eating places there is a food place that delivers up to your room 24/7 i was deffinatley recommend trying their pancakes. There is also a buffet place to eat within the hotel i think its around £30 dollars and its pretty much all you can eat of a variety of foods. All staff where friendly and welcoming the maids clean your room everyday and we left money around the room and it had not been touched by our maids. There is also a swimming pool free to use by the hotel guest which supply you with beach towels. The dolphin and tiger sanctuary in the hotel is a must see aswel. Outside this hotel is a mcdonalds if anyone is interested in that but we found ourselves walking up and down the strip looking in all the other hotels. We did try the breakfast buffet at the Bellagio which is a must. But i would deffinatley recommend staying in th3 mirage and always using UBER rather than a normal taxi as you always know what your going to pay before the trip. Next to reception there is a nightclub which is pretty famous called 1OAK a lot of famous people visit their especially the Kardashians. If you go down early through the day you can ask to be put on the guest list for the night.  We got married in vegas and stayed in the mirrage safe to say we fell in love with vegas and cant wait to go back.
40,We stayed here for six nights for our first time in Vegas. Stayed on the tower floors. Great views of the strip and volcano. Nice rooms with a large bathroom. The room was cleaned every day and we had no complaints. Had a buffet included with the room and had a varied and tasty breakfast. Would definitely stay there again.
40,This is a very nice casino with gorgeous grounds. The staff are very friendly and it has many areas inside the casino grounds itself to visit. I think it is one of the nicer casinos to visit in Las Vegas.
50,I had found my old buddy from the Air Force on social media. We met for a 3 day weekend and had a blast. I revived a low cost upgrade to a penthouse suite. The restrictions were great and the casino was full of good energy. The Mirage I a great place to stay and enjoy Las Vegas at the heart of everything.
40,Ive stayed here many times. the resort fees and taxes make my trade show price ridiculous. The trade show rate plus taxes would be ok. but the resort fees and more taxes are excessive. location works. I've been staying at other hotels for points related bonuses yet this was very convenient
50,The hotel is beautiful. Easy check-in and upgrade . The pool area is family friendly and the staff is amazing . One of the guys working the pool area brought life jackets for our kids to the area we were sitting. Nice restaurants and night entertainment in the casino.
50,Since we booked early and stayed the week after Memorial Day we got a great deal on a two-bedroom suite and were then able to upgrade to a two-bedroom penthouse. Very clean awesome rooms and spa beautiful pool etc!
30,Although the staff was very polite the rooms were dirty. I expected better from an MGM company location especially for the prices. I expect the rooms to be cleaner than mine at home. There was white stuff all over the carpet. Dirt on the bathroom floor. Garbage cans should have been cleaner. Although the rooms are nice but dirtly
50,We stayed at the hotel it was nice. Nothing super amazing until you get to the pool. Can I just say go to the pool! Even if you aren't staying here pay the resort fee and go to the pool! it is amazing and so worth it! Drinks are served as they have waiters come and take your order. Rest room with shower was nice as well. The pool is beautiful and perfect temperature.
30,The Mirage has a beautiful pool albeit a bit smaller than it was to create more deck space for chairs. The big problem is people save multiple chairs in case they want to move around the pool at different parts of the day (sun). An even bigger protists they leave towels with no personal items and leave for the day. The pool staff do not clear out these chairs so the net result is standing room only. ADVICE - if you need a chair ask a pool attendant and they will then pull towels off chairs that have been sitting for hours.
40,I used AAA for the vacation package for Hotel & Airline..After over $2k dollars I needed to pay daily resort fee plus $100 fee..I was asked if we are using mini bar $300 fee I said no but the refrigerator has a digital lock so couldn't even store drinks for $35 daily they will put a refrigerator in the room we declined it. The room 16037 was a volcano view which costs more but you could just walk outside hotel to see it because the room itself was average and shows sign of wear look at their website carefully. There is no smoke free section so how is this a family friendly hotel plus people you wouldn't want your kids to see its Vegas!! We bought a Pizza $19 and a can coke $4 plus fees the only good about the food is that buffet includes alcohol but mainly beer. join their rewards plus military get discounts. Across the street is a Walgreens and fast food where I bought drinks and a cooler but you have to walk a ways to the right or left because hotel parking and volcano view you can't walk straight out of hotel but Harrah's is across the street easier access to shops. We bought monorail passes but its across the street go through Harrah's Casino to access which also stops a Flamingo which is across the street to Caesars and Hells Kitchen plus other casinos. Food is very expensive so do thorough research and you'll enjoy your visit.
10,Oh boy. Where do I start. I have been to mirage 5 times before and usually it’s decent. This time it was BRUTAL. First we had another traveler wake us up by walking into the room at 3:00 am. They had double booked the room. Next .. we get a phone call at 4 am fromftimt desk saying  they had no idea who we were and that we should NOT be in that room. After 10 minutes of discussions they allowed us to stay in that room ( of course we were miserable the next day  due to lack of sleep). Then the following day we went to watch the raptors play at the still  we had NO waitress serve us for our drinks. Pathetic. Then few days later we went to the still again this time things got worse. The brunette bartender began insulting and yelling at us for no apparent reason. Wouldn’t stay here again. There are better hotels on the strip.
50,Love the location love the tropical vibe and atmosphere. We saw the Beatles Love show and it was fantastic. All the restaurants were good and all of the casino staff and dealers were very helpful and friendly 3rd time staying here and it's great value for the price.
40,Property is located in a good location on the strip. Although it’s an older property it is well maintained. Casino is a good size and provides enough winning to keep people coming back. Great choices of food. Carnegie deli and the pantry had great food. Shows are average. They could be better. Service is average. Rooms are clean and comfortable.
20,What is the point of checking in early if your room is still not going to be ready by the time you arrive? Check-in is 3pm we arrived after 6pm and our rooms still wasn't ready! The front desk couldn't tell us why it wasn't ready even though I had already checked-in. Once inside the suite it smelled like marijuana there were cup rings on the marble-like counter tops the room with the king size bed did not look like it was cleaned all the way - oily finger prints very visible on the black dresser. The price for the room is not worth it at all. I would not choose the same room again.
40,Excellent: Big King room super comfortable bed excellent service great restaurants great location mobile checkin  Boo: No Coffee Makers Do not open mini fridge you will get charged for just looking or touching over a certain time period of 15 seconds I believe. Room smelled moldy/musty when fan turned on
50,This place was great all the way around. Very clean super comfortable beds beautiful property nice casino & incredibly helpful staff. It also has great restaurants and shops as well as 2 coffee shops. Really good location and even has a tram to Treasure Island!
50,I've always wanted to stay at the Mirage and the stay met my hope/expectation. The hotel is a great value if you want to be on the strip get a nice hotel and not pay as much as the Bellagio Wynn etc. The pool is amazing and I really like the casino layout. We would definitely come back!
50,We have finally returned to Vegas for our annual sister's trip! (last year was Italy). We decided to head back to the Mirage and so glad we did! This hotel is in such a great location the room was clean (very important) and the meals we enjoyed at The Pantry were amazing. Once again the staff was great we didn't get a view this time but we didn't mind. Thank you Mirage for another wonderful experience.
40,I came to this hotel for business. I was very pleased with the online check-in and check-out services. The atmosphere in the hotel was comfortable & fun to spend time on the main floor. The food offerings were very good. I'd come back!
20,Bathroom is far too small limited toiletries provided  Room was dirty the dust and rubbish under the bedside cabinets had obviously been there for weeks. Glasses were cleaned only once by room service during our week stay.  Noisy casino poor waitress staffing for drinks spent our time in other hotels which were more amenable.  Be prepared to queue for hours to book a show here. Food options were ok however much better outside the hotel  Better deals out there at better hotels
40,The staff was friendly. The rooms clean. The beds were great! The casino was smokey....but I guess you would find this in any of the casinos since they allow smoking. I would have no problem staying here again.
10,The Mirage hotel has always been our go to hotel to stay in when visiting Vegas.    When we arrived at the hotel for our stay last year we were told we were in an accessible room which we didn’t need and felt it wouldn’t be appropriate for us to stay in a room that someone may actually need. Instead of changing us we were told it was that or we could pay for an upgrade to one if the Stay Well rooms. We decided to do this reluctantly due to not wanting to be in an accessible room.    We didn’t feel the check in process was positive we were told about signing up for M Life but weren’t really told how to use it we just felt like we were giving our details without fully being told how we could benefit from the scheme.    The room features sounded good although they’re not on a very high floor. However when we arrived in our room we were severely underwhelmed by the room. It felt no different than the other rooms other than having a unit on the end of the cabinet which I’m sure did something but it didn’t appear to be when we were there. The shower head looked different but didn’t feel any different.    There were stains on the carpet someone had drawn on the picture in the room the windows were filthy and the phone next to the bed wasn’t even connected. Considering the room had apparently been newly renovated it felt warn.    When we reached the end of our trip we visited the M Life desk to see how it all worked having spent a lot on show tickets and meals al other associated hotels. The lady took all of our receipts and tickets told they’d go on our account. However when we arrived back in the UK found our account showed zero still (and still does).    When we raised all of our concerns at check out we asked to see the manager and he was helpful. However I feel it is disappointing to have to complain about all the things we had to.    As I said the Mirage was always our go to hotel when visiting Vegas however we would consider staying elsewhere next time. The stay well room is not worth the money the parking is extortionate and a lot of the staff lacked the quality of customer service that we have seen previously. And the M Life scheme just topped off the poor experience we had.
30,Mirage is in a good location but is in need a serious updating. We checked into our assigned room and found the headboard had a large rip in it the bathroom was not clean and the tub was rusted in various places and the entire room smelled bad. Called the front desk and they reassigned us to another room on the same floor it was better but still needed updating as the carpet was well worn and the bathtub drain stop was broken. The Bathroom sink was cloaked and drained very slowly. But the room smelled better than the first one and was a little brighter so we didn't complain. Casino is well maintained along with the pool area but I do not gamble much and therefore was disappointed at how MGM has let the property go. The Mirage used to be one of the premier properties on the Las Vegas Strip. With a $37 resort fee and daily parking fee MGM should be doing a better job at maintaining this classic property.
50,Hotel is perfectly located on the strip as it is right in the middle of everything! It is beautiful affordable comfortable and so convenient to everything on the strip! My new favorite place to stay!
40,Stayed at various hotels on the strip but this was the best so farthey upgraded our room to one of the staywell rooms which was excellent.all the resort was cleanthe pool excellent .cravings buffethuge choice and discount for residents. The whole stay was really good and hoping to return.The only annoyance in the room was the snacks trayif any of the snacks where knocked over or picked up you were charged on your billa few trips to the reception to have the charges wiped off were neededthey understood and removed them off the room billbe aware.
50,This was our first time in Las Vegas and the Mirage made it amazing. The staff are so helpful and the hotel is gorgeous. It was very clean and had everything we needed and then some. We will definitely stay here again!
40,Miraj is among good hotels of Las Vegas  A wonderful ambiance with full of water fountains and falls in and out of hotel.  Casino like other hotels is vibrant  People from all over world come here to gamble . I suggest to avoid casino part nothing is won eventually you loose so avoid casino  Else all good
10,I reserved a bedroom suite in April. Based on the pictures it looked like a great Vegas room. Imagine a conference room that has two bedrooms attached. That’s what I got. Old and musty. I didn’t complain because my daughter who had never been to Vegas thought it was great. I didn’t want to ruin her experience and show her the real room I wanted.  Check in was sloppy. The room wasn’t ready so they gave me a food credit. And guess what. They still charged me for my purchases.  In Vegas I don’t mind losing my money on the slots. But I don’t want to be robbed by the host. In my opinion this is what happened here. Spend your money at a non MGM resort. Or better yet stay away from Vegas and go to an Indian casino near your home. The Strip has become too seedy.
50,First time staying here really enjoyed the pool. Wish the valet fees weren't so high. Would have been nice to have those fees waived. Would stay here again with my kids. Great location to visit other hotels on the strip.
50,This was my 3rd trip here and I won't stay anywhere else. From the moment you check in to the moment you leave they make you feel at home and treat you like a king. Love the staff the pool the location all of it.
50,Weather was not good but the hotel was great. We received a great upgrade for our anniversary and we totally enjoyed it. Won some money but left the majority there....lol. We will definitely return hopefully before the end of September.
10,many of the staff members couldn't care less about service.Some were ok but for the most part dismissive.This is a hotel we will never stay at again! ....We tried to leave the property as much as we could while there.
20,What would have been a fond memory was spoiled by the actions of a security guard. In the interval between my paid-for late check out and my red-eye flight while my wife was playing I took a seat in the sports betting area. A security guard asked if I was staying at the hotel. I told him that I had checked out. I could have said that I was. I had a room key in my pocket. I thought the truth was innocent. He told me to call it a day and leave the casino.    I am a seventy-two year old retired Certified Public Accountant and financial vice president. I serve as Treasurer of my synagogue. This was the only time in my life that I was ever treated as a vagrant.
50,Great service rewards check in rooms location and pool sums it up nicely. Its thr only place i would ever stay and i visit las veagas every year since 1990 and i have tried others but never change again
50,While there’s so many places to choose to stay in Vegas this is my favorite! It’s centrally located and has the best pool! As for the casino it’s easy to get around. Across the street at Harrahs you can find $5 card tables!
10,Unsanitary Room Condition; Powerful Mildew Odor. Provided an Air Purifier (Air Purifier Needed to Run Continuously). In Addition (Private Body Area) Body Hair in Shower Wall and Shower Curtain.  Unsanitary Pool Condition; Someone Spew Out Bile in The Pool Water (Water Was Not Drained and/or Replaced) Merely Treated with Chlorin! Pool Reopened Barely (1) One Hour After the Sick Person Expelled Vomit into The Pool Water. 2nd Night Stay Someone from Housekeeping (Requesting the Air Purifier) Awakened my Family Opining the Room Door at 2300 hr. (11pm). Alarming my Spouse and Children (an Excess of 10 min was Required to Calm our 9 & 3 Yr. Old Girls)    Staff Did Not Exhibit Any Concern and/or Interest Towards Our Alarm or Uneasiness. Simply Provided Excuses and/or Minimal Solutions
50,Such a beautiful hotel and amazing pool! Everyone was really nice and the grounds were super clean! Close to Caesars and Bellagio. This was a perfect couples get away but there was also a ton of families
20,Room smelled so bad cleaning staff had to spray carpet to mask the smell. Carpet is very much stained and bath room grouts are dirty. I also found a lot of really short hairs in the tub. We had lunch at the deli and it was great. Buffet dinner at Craving Is totally different story. I am not going back there.  I feel sorry for myself that I am stuck here until Thursday with food they provide for conference.  Staffs are very nice so far.
50,I've been traveling to Vegas for 30 years and The Mirage never disappoints. It's been my choice of hotels for the last 9 years. They have competitive rates and availability. If something is not right the staff makes it right. Excellent service and staff.
50,The Staff at this Hotel is amazing  It is set up in the heart of the main strip so you are very central of all the action the hotel pool is AMAZING and the Sigried and Roy Secret Garden is a must see.  If you are into Tattoos they have an awesome Tattoo shop with amazing artists in the Hotel .  Love The Mirage will definitely be back!
50,We recently stayed at the Mirage over the Memorial Day weekend to have a short vacation and to see the Love show. The hotel was clean the staff were friendly and the show was awesome! The hotel was also centrally located so it was easy to get up and down the strip. We would definitely stay again if we ever get back to Vegas.
50,The property is located in a great place on the strip making it easy to walk. The Mirage is beautiful clean and the staff is very friendly. The place is big and it took the first day to figure out how to find our way around.
50,It was a great stay. I had no problems and enjoy the Mirage over other strip properties. Its not busy and its easy to get in and out of. Its very clean and fun. I love the restaurants and all the gambling areas.
50,Overall it was a great trip! Great hotel/casino! Great restaurantsgreat food selection. Only downside was the casino floor cocktail staff. NOTE ENOUGH waitstaff and too long of a wait to request & receive your drink order!!
50,The Mirage was one of the best M Life properties I have stayed at. Exceptional service beautiful hotel and a wide variety of casino games. Centrally located on the Vegas strip so convenient for all interests.
40,I booked this hotel in January for a late May trip with family. Tina was excellent with the reservations and we ended up reserving a king tower suite with a connecting king room for the 5 of us. I was a little nervous after reading these reviews for the 4 months leading up to the trip as several reports commented on cleanliness of rooms etc. I downloaded the mgm mobile app beforehand and checked in the day prior. Upon our arrival (11:45AM) our room was not ready. I later checked in at the desk at 3:00pm and was told the room was still not ready and to check back in an hour. I was provided with keys to the rooms and was told they would activate them and send me a text message once ready. At 4:00PM I called the desk and was told they needed 1 more hour to clean but They could put me in another suite without a strip view. We elected to wait the hour and it was well worth it. The strip/pool view was great and I was impressed with the suite. We had a small kitchenette area with a refrigerator in addition  to the stocked refrigerator most reviewers  Complained about. We had no issues with that fridge and never opened it. The beds were ok as far as comfort goes. My family did state the room had a body odor in the room but I didn’t notice. I liked the special elevators for the suite floors and we ended up on the B suite level. We ate at the Still on several occasions(excellent) watched the Love show which was very good and went to the pool one day and were able to find seats around 1:00pm but it was busy. I didn’t detect a strong smoke odor in the casino but others in my group did. I would definitely return to this hotel. The location is excellent the price was more than fair and we had a good time.
50,Must need get away break with husband. Weather was not too great but everything else was. This was a trip to relax and rest and I accomplished that didn't win any jackpot . Costa Azul Restaurant at the Mirage was delicious.
50,Didn't stay at the hotel but did go to gamble and look around. It is beautiful and they pump something into the air that makes it smell wonderful. There is a massive fish tank at check in and a waterfall inside. The outside of the casino also has more waterfalls and the volcanoes. Unfortunately I couldn't get the timing right and missed the volcanoes.
10,Before reading our review please understand we love travelling and have stayed in many hotels around the world and never have we experienced such awful treatment from a hotel. It takes a lot for me to leave a negative review- but here it is.    We have just returned after staying at the mirage for 11 nights.    In summary:    Everything is hugely over priced compared to other places along the strip.    Below are a few of our complaints regarding the room and general service .The only positive thing I will say is that the beds are comfortable but other than that rooms and in particular the bathrooms are in need of huge refurbishment.  There was a nasty smell in the room as well- it smelled of damp.  Walls are paper thin we could hear drilling from bathroom repairs across the hall for 4 mornings and also the children in the room next door (not their fault).  There are no tea/coffee facilities in the room.    Cleaners ignore do not disturb signs and just enter the room- or do not clean at all (on 3 occasions).    The worst is the state of the bathroom. They are really small with no space between the bath/shower and toilet. The shower head cannot move the water hurts you when spraying the drains are clogged so you stand in a bath full of water the toilet seat moves when you sit on it and the floor is always slightly wet causing you to slip.    A member of our party actually fell off the toilet seat (that was already moving whenever you sat on it). This happened after a night out (so yes had a drink but that was not the cause) when they called reception to advise them of the incident they said they would send an engineer to have a look as the floor was being flooded.  An engineer did not arrive instead they sent security they were literally made to feel like criminals!  The attitude from security who took photos was shocking - with no actual plumber or engineer even checking the toilet they decided our friends had broken the toilet on purpose and needed to pay for it.    My friends refused and explained the issues we had all had all holiday and that it was clearly wear and tear and an accident waiting to happen please could they move them to another room with facilities that could be used safely as we were all checking out in the morning.  To cut a long story short after going to reception to resolve they were treated awfully with security surrounding them at reception trying to intimidate and bully them into agreeing that they were at fault and had broken the toilet on purpose!?  (Our friend had hurt and bruised their arm in the fall and at no point did anyone ask if they were injured or hurt in anyway)    The manager then advised that they were either to pay for another room or the broken toilet- this was refused as they actually could not believe The Mirage staff were accusing them of damaging hotel property and on purpose?!  It was them that called the reception to advise of the incident/accident in the first place- why would they do this if they had intentionally broken a toilet!?    They then chose to kick them out onto the street at 4am.    Staggered is all we can say. Have never seen or heard anything like this they would not listen to a word that they said.  They just wanted to make some money from the situation and when they would not be bullied into paying they kicked them out. Disgraceful.    I urge you please make sure if you have a wobbly toilet wet floor or anything a bit off in your room- advise them immediately and take your own photos/videos if you choose to stay here.  ( I can't believe you have to think like that going on a holiday and staying in what is supposed a good reputable hotel)  If you don't they will turn it around onto you and make out you have broken things to collect damages. We will never use this greedy badly managed hotel again and will urge many of of friends who visit Vegas a lot not to either.    Outside of the hotel issues the holiday was amazing and we had a great time- so with so many other hotels to pick from we will absolutely return to Vegas just not to The Mirage.  Read less
50,Came with my two homeboys. Got two rooms through mlife. The room was great and clean. The staff was great. The slots were good to me. The switch blackjack was fun. The pool was amazing awesome vibe out there. LVB Burger was great for a late night bite. We liked the location on the strip.
50,Stayed here 3 times for business and love it because it's not as crowded as some of the other places in Vegas you can walk across the street to the Venetian and the pool area is one of the best. The first year I stayed there i had a great room and the last was ok.
10,I would recommend going elsewhere spend the extra money for a place across the street. Noisy stinky low quality old. The only plus was location. We left one night after paying for two to save our vacation...
40,"The Mirage is still going well after nearly 30 yrs. at the center of the strip. It may not be quite as ""fresh"" as some of it's neighbors across the street but they've done pretty well at keeping the property updated and it's not bad at all. We had a very nice stay in a one bedroom tower suite on the 26th floor. We checked in about 5 pm room/suite was ready to go. We had suite A56 and it was in good shape with everything working just fine. The bed was comfy the shower and jetted tub were nice and maid service was very good and timely during our 3 day stay. I will say the couch was kind of hard? not a place where anyone could comfortably even catch a nap. The casino? Good selection of machines but extremely tight. We did enjoy the horse racing machine. We did catch Gabriel Iglesias (Fluffy) and it was a great show. He was really engaged and it was better than expected. We tried the Cravings Buffet for breakfast one morning pretty decent good selection and food quality. We also tried..The Still. It was fair the food was OK but very very slow. In summary The Mirage has not turned into a total dive like some other late 80's and 90's Vegas properties and is stil a good choice for ""center of the strip""."
50,Look it's not the Venetian or Bellagio don't expect the extravagant paintings and things. But for the price / value the Mirage is not bad at all. It's clean the staff is friendly the rooms have been updated and the 1st bar when you walk in the hotel has 2 for 1 drinks from 1 -3pm 7 1am to 3am. It's Center Strip so you are right in the middle of all the action. The Rhumbar is pretty relaxing as well. I know everyone has different experiences but my stay everything was perfectly fine.
50,I recently stayed at the Mirage for the first time. It was a lovely place to stay. I really love the pool area. The waterfalls are so fun. Every night I watched the volcano erupt out my room window. The staff was very responsive to any concerns we had. Everything is very convenient and most things we needed were just steps away.
50,Great hotel in the perfect spot. We liked the fact it wasn’t right in the busiest part of the strip but easy walking distance. Rooms were lovely. Lifts quick. Nice pool although you need to get your towels down early! Lots of choice of food.
30,A lovely hotel however the pool is a nightmare and far too small for the number of guests it can hold. In order to get a seat at the pool you have to join a queue at 8am to hopefully secure a seat. Guests tend to put 5-6 towels down at a time on chairs for others. The photographs on there website make the pool area look very large it is not.    Cleanliness is another issue our maid was pleasant enough but the build up of dust in the room (which apparently was cleaned that day) was horrific.    I love Vegas and have stayed numerous times in the past at other hotels but unfortunately would not stay at the Mirage again!!!!
20,My issue with my stay is my room. My bed (head board) was ripped in several areas and was dirty. I had to go to a local store to go buy a bed sheets to sleep on. I felt so uncomfortable sleeping in the bed that I spend much of my time at my friends suite. Unfortunately I ended up at the foot of the bed curls up. Not a nice room experience.
50,Stayed May 23-26. The 12th floor “stay well “ floor was was so peaceful and zen . We requested a room away from the elevator so it would be quiet- the walk from the elevator was long ( as we were told bythe front desk staff ). The room was super clean . There was nice music lighting aromatherapy with aquarium channel on the large screen television. the double queen room was huge with comfy matress and pillows. The bathroom was small but super clean and had great lighting including a lighted magnifying mirror. The shower had a filter to make the water softer-quite nice. The room was quiet the first night but noisy neighbors made that the only night. We had a screaming toddler across the hall and his rude parents stood in the hall screaming at each other quite often which was unfortunate but not the hotels fault. One of the other reviews said the noise in the hall was loud with the gap under the door and tiled floor foyer and I agree that did magnify the hallway noise when the neighbors were in the hall planning their night out. We left the room the first day and the sweet quiet housekeeping staff asked if we needed anything as we had the do not disturb sign on. The housekeeping staff was so kind and urged us to call for anything for the room 24 hours a day. During our stay we visited the pool the dolphin habitat  Lobby bar Coffee Bean Starbucks Cravings Buffet  The Pantry and the casino. The casino had excellent drink service and pleasant staff. I loved the Mirage .
20,You don’t get a refrigerator there are no outlets by the bed nor are there coffee makers. When I got there they did not have my room so I had to wait a night and Change rooms the next day which was so inconvenient. So if you don’t care about any of those things like I do you will be just fine. Other than that it was amazing!
50,I had a great time. And it was really easy to find restaurants and shows here at the hotel. People were friendly and helpful. I saw variuos shows and they were incredible. My wife and I will be coming back soon.
40,There's a lot of competition for good hotels on the Las Vegas strip. The Mirage has a long history of offering good amenities and good service. Nothing spectacular to make it stand out from the others but it's definitely a solid option. Room was clean large and quiet. Check in line can be rather long but moves quickly. Good restaurant options in the hotel and nearby.
50,We’re so glad we came back to the Mirage. Our favorite pool in Vegas. The food at LVB was excellent! Loved the Lamb burger. Had a great trip me at the Center bar and a little gambling too. Planning another trip in September! ❤️
40,Had guests attending a private party after my son's wedding. The room setup was disappointing as our two-bedroom suite had no entry to the bathroom without the guests going thru our bedroom. The suite itself was lovely but the bathroom to the second bdrm was also extremely small
50,great service great food and the best pool in Vegas. The Mirage does need to give more late night eating options. The casino does get quite busy and getting into certain games is difficult at best on the weekend. Have been multiple time and have always enjoyed my stay.
10,I just returned after staying at the mirage for 11 nights. Before writing my comments I would like to say I travel all over the world multiple times a year (pleasure and work) and this is only the second occasion I have ever made a review of this type.    In summary:  The Mirage hotel is not interested in customer service you are only a dollar sign to them.    I had many disappointing experiences but will list just a couple;    1. Turning people away from the happy hour lobby bar at happy hour on my second day at the hotel.    I approached the hotel manager to ask why it was being closed as no other bars were offering happy hour and I was told it is his authority to close the bar. Just to add a group of people who had just arrived with cases after 20 hours of travelling were also refused plus many other guests.    The managers only arrogant explanation was the bar was not busy reason for this is that everyone was being refused to be served.    2. Cleaners ignoring do not disturb signs and just entering the room while you were in the shower or in bed. Even on our last day with checkout at 11am we had loud bangs on the door before 10am (we had used the security bar) and they did not go away until we opened the door (once again I was in the shower)    3. This is by far the worst the state of the bathroom. The shower head cannot move the water hurts when spraying the drains are clogged so you stand in a bath full of water the toilet seat moves when you sit on it and the floor is always slightly wet causing you to slip.    A friend was staying a couple of doors down and actually fell off the toilet seat that was already moving whenever you sat on it after a night out (so yes had a drink) when she called reception to advise they said they would send an engineer. A engineer did not arrive and the attitude from security who took photos was that she needed to pay for the toilet. She advised no you need to put me in another room. To cut a long story short after going to reception to resolve (she also had bruises) she was treated awfully with security surrounding her and basically kicked out of the hotel at 4am. Wow I have never seen or heard anything like this they would not listen to a word that she said.    I am reporting to our travel company but I urge you please never use this greedy badly managed hotel for your stay.    Outside of the hotel we had the most fabulous holiday.
40,Room not ready upon arrival- had to wait two hours. Them had to make line again to get status. After we got our room our view wasn’t even nice. It was to rooftops and parking lot. How wonderful. Overall I’ll give it a 5/10.
20,We visited the Mirage over Memorial weekend. Our room smelled like mold really bad and the air conditioner didn’t keep up. We did eventually ask to change rooms and the accommodated us the second room did not have a smell but air conditioner still was unable to keep it cool in the room.
20,As a person who has medicine that must be kept at certain temperature you can only imagine my panic when I discovered my room did not have a fridge. The staff were incapable of providing an adequate remedy to this problem and I was forced to use the rooms ice bucket to keep my medicine cold.
20,Hotel is a bit dated.  Room was a double double instead of 2 queen  Bathroom had a variety of broken tiles  The volcano view also overlooks the plain and non-scenic rooftop. The volcano only goes off 3 times a night I wouldn’t consider it an upgrade.  The staff cleans the common area floor nightly which leaves you navigating through a series of roped off sections.  Good variety of eateries.  The fountain areas outside did not have water in them and looked a bit barren.  Pricing for our stay was very similar to the PARK MGM but we chose this hotel for its pool. Unfortunately people arrive when the pool opens to leave towels on chairs then they return to their room or wherever and the people actually using the pool have no where to relax in the sun.  First time at this hotel I’d suggest the Linq Planet Hollywood or Park MGM since prices are comparable and they are more updated
40,Loved the look and feel of the place. Location puts you back a bit from the main drag of the strip. The pool is beautiful but go early to get a chair. Casino is average nothing under $10 for table games which seems to be standard now. On site dining is ok the buffet is decent but nothing amazing. Like all the other hotels it has a worthless resort fee that gets you subpar wifi and access to the gym which doesnt give you access to the spa showers or saunas. I dont use the wifi or any of the resort fee amenities but you still have to pay as far as I know. Overall not a bad spot to stay.
10,Spent the entire memorial day weekend there and they never cleaned our room. They told us that since we requested a late cleaning one evening that our room automatically got changed to a call as needed for housekeeping. This is never conveyed to us. After speaking to the front desk they removed the resort fee. The resort fee was like $40. The front desk manager tried to tell me that the housekeeping cost is included in the resort fee. Never staying here again!
10,We were in a comped room for 4 nights. On the 4th night front desk called at 9:30 PM and requested we vacate...no reason for the lateness only that we needed to leave. They called us back and said we could stay for over $500...
40,For the most part we enjoyed our stay at the Mirage. I will add that this casino seemed smokier than others in this immediate area. We did have one issue with on the female blackjack dealers. She was very rude to my wife however one of the floor managers made it up to us by giving us a $50 voucher to use in the hotel.
30,DO NOT purchase necessities from the stores inside the hotel. Find an outside shop. VERY EXPENSIVE ($7.00 for bottled water).    No coffee pot in the rooms. My wife wanted to make some tea. Housekeeping stated coffee makers were not available (??? what kind of hotel does not have coffee makers in the room???) and had to order hot water from Room Service ($15.00 each time she wanted tea).    Needed to store some refrigerated items. Were not allowed to use the mini fridge in the room (that was for Mini Bar Stuff only). Had to rent a mini fridge for $33.00 a day. so we had to have 2 mini fridges in the room (both making a lot of noise when trying to sleep).    Other than the nickle and dime scheme that the hotel has going on it was a great stay.
50,The stay well rooms were amazing! definitely worth the $25 room upgrade!! The staff was kind and tenative. There were plenty of great food options especially the 24 hour breakfast restauranyt! Hotel was great. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here!
40,A group of 20 of us attended from England for Memorial Day weekend. The casino was brilliant with several bars and restaurants to cater for everyone. Very spacious however gets very busy when the Beatles Cirque du Soleil ends. The rooms were a decent size the beds extremely comfortable. Only downside is the smell of the air being pumped into the rooms is sometimes a bit off...unless you are on the 12th floor where a smell of mint is included (by the end of the week all your luggage and clothing stinks of it). There was clumps of long black hair stuck to the tiles in the shower in several of our rooms. Not sure I’d stay here again maybe migrate back to Planet Hollywood next time
50,The room was clean. The bed was great. The food was good. The Beatles show was excellent. Wonderful friendly staff. Too many smokers is my only complaint. I have stayed here before and will stay here again.
50,This was our sixth trip to Vegas and our first stay at the Mirage. It was A GREAT location with comfortable rooms a fun environment and tons of great choices for dining. The casino was fun clean and not overly crowded.
50,We had a great time. The location is perfect. Walgreens right across the street. Easy access to get anywhere. Great staff great food and just always a good time. The casino itself is so easy to get around. as well.
50,this was an awesome trip. Mirage was wonderful. Staff were friendly and helpful. Would go back anytime. Rooms were clean the food was good a little expensive but hey you're in Vegas on the strip. Lots to see just blocks away.
50,This place delivers time and time again. Check in is easy rooms are decent and the location is perfect. The pool here is beautiful and the slots drink service was super quick. My go to spot in Vegas.
30,Paid a little extra for a “strip view” room. Instead my view was the loading docks of Caesar’s. I’ve had better and cheaper rooms on business trips. I was thoroughly underwhelmed during my first trip to The Vegas strip. I’ll be staying at a downtown hotel/casino next time.
50,The last few times I’d been to Vegas I stayed anywhere bw MGM/NY-NY & the Bellagio on the strip. This was my first stay at The Mirage & I was very pleased with everything. You can tell it’s an older resort but it’s very well maintained & updated. The room size was large. Housekeeping had the room cleaned every day as soon as we left the room for the first time of the day. The casino was massive & had everything you can think of you to gamble on. Some of the casino allows smoking & I felt like the smoke got through the vents to the room over the course of the night. That was literally the only negative I have & it wasn’t even that bad. The pool was great; large pool with waterfalls & lots of chairs. If you plan on going to the pool go early bc I found people claim chairs as soon as it opens so if you get there late you have slim picking with where you want to lay out. Lots of restaurants & stores to go to on site as well. All the restaurants offered delivery to the room. The location of the resort is in a good proximity to things as it’s half a mile to Bellagio on one side half a mile to the Fashion Show Mall on the other side & directly across the street from Harrah’s & the Venetian.
50,We stayed for 4 nights over a weekend. The check in line was huge when we arrived and we had to wait 35 minutes before being served. Saying that housekeeping was amazing. Our room was perfectly clean everyday. We dined at the buffet on 2 occasions and would highly recommend this. Not cheap at US$120 for 4 people however this includes all beer & wine as well but no discount if you are under 21. It was a good stay but would try somewhere different next time.
50,My daughter and I spent a week at the Mirage from may 9. We visited 9 years ago and were a little apprehensive after reading a few negative reviews re the condition of the rooms. Well yes they are 9 years older but quality endures and our room was as lovely as we remembered it. We were upgraded to a partial strip view room that also looked down on their wonderful pool. Over the whole week we were never disturbed by noise from adjoining rooms. Their selection of eateries was extensive we loved Pantry for breakfast as did many others. There was always a line but it was well managed and moved quickly. We saw Love and I was blown awayit was one of the highlights of our trip. The pool was so popular it was hard to get loungers but we persevered. Over the week we visited many other casinos which in our opinion didnt measure up to the Mirage. We even had a few small wins on the slots. And as a last word. Get over the expensive mini bar. Just dont use it. It was not an issue with us. If we are ever fortunate to get back to the US and come to Vegas we would choose the Mirage again.
50,Another great stay at the Mirage. It remains our favourite hotel on the strip.  Best location best pool (apart from maybe mandalay bay) and great choice of restaurants. Beatles love show was amazing and plentiful free drinks and the odd win on slots.  But...our coridoor STANK of cannabis coming from the first room by the elevators. Don't get me wrong...I'm not judging it's use and it's now legal in Nevada.. but it's a non smoking floor. My husband went down to the casino to smoke. Why should smoking cannabis be tolerated? I pity the people who got the room after them.  Won't stop us going back.. But think management really need to do something about it
40,Great location beautiful atmosphere encountered a rude front desk clerk and bellmen who almost ran me over with cart and kept going without apologizing overall staff is friendly. Wait staff friendly food is great
40,I will say the Mirage has undergone some great renovations to its casino over the past couple years. It was also my favorite place to gamble when we visited. I had not stayed in the hotel until this past trip. For the price it is a more reasonable hotel on the strip. The rooms are quite spacious but the bathrooms leave a bit to be desired. They’re on the small side and I cannot imagine sharing it with anyone else.    Traveling with a kid he made a few messes and they cleaned them up well. Nothing too drastic just some spilled snacks here and there.    But the bathroom had hair on the wall before we even used the shower that was definitely not great.    Their towels are ridiculously cheap and they don’t have robes in the rooms.    The bed was as comfortable as you can hope for but the pillows in my opinion were too soft. Bed was also a good size in a single room.    The pool is a good one here big and plenty of space for everyone. Can’t speak to the BARE pool since I had a toddler with me but I imagine it’s pretty good too.    The food selections at the Mirage is good. They have a 24 hour place close to the room elevators. It had some good selections.
50,We had a great time at the Mirage. It is in a great spot on the strip. The restaurants are very good as are the bars. Pool was nice but over crowded. We would definately stay here again next time we come to vegad
50,The Mirage Las Vegas never disappoints us! The service the room the food and the atmosphere was exceptional! We have stayed twice a year for over 20 years and will continue to frequent this hotel. The location is in the middle of everything and we highly recommend you give it a try!
50,We were dragging after a delay in our flight forced us to miss the first entire day of our vacation. At check-in I mentioned we were celebrating my husband's 75th birthday. Not sure if that was the reason but we received a great room upgrade. This raised our spirits for sure and we truly enjoyed all the added amenities. The Mirage may not be the newest hotel in town but we feel comfortable there. We really enjoy using the pool during the day. The only drawback here is that you have to get up very early and often wait in a long line to get a seat at the pool. I wish this could be improved. However we did get up early so always managed to get a great seat. We love the pool here. We ate at several of the onsite restaurants/coffee shops and had very good experiences. We like to play the slots but they were very tight so we played elsewhere. Come on Mirage...give us a little to play with.
50,Everything was wonderful. The staff was knowledgeable and accommodating. The varied selection of restaurants on the property was exceptional. Even though I did not come out ahead with the gambling I enjoyed the slot machines.
50,My wife and I have been coming to Las Vegas for the past 3 years and this was our first time at the Mirage. From the time we arrived to our checkout we were very impressed. The hotel was clean staff polite great pool and casino! We will be back for sure !
50,This was my first time to Las Vegas and The Mirage was a great place to stay. Easy to get to and located right in the middle of the Las Vegas strip with an almost perfect location near almost all of the attractions. HIKERS - The Mirage is hiker friendly and helped me out quite a bit due to inclement weather and was able to accommodate needing to change my schedule several times.
50,This is to me the premier hotel and casino because its the one that started the grand display and exclusive staff treatment in this city. Its always fantastic to be here. The feeling it provides is luxurious and the tropical setting is always a comfort. With so much to do you can stay here and not need to leave. The start if your stay begins with the largest aquarium in vegas as a backdrop to the check in area. The ambience never changes with the pool area and dinning areas quickly accessible to the main casino area and room access directly in and out of the casinos. Some hotels make you walk long distances just to get to your rooms. The rooms are very nice as far as vegas standards go. But after staying at the wynn feel a little aged. The food choices are better then most but affordable food is lacking. The staff at the mirage is beyond fantastic and the casino is a great time. The layout is perfect along with fair priced tables. I would recommend this hotel for most but not really for the kids. Use the many other kid friendly hotels vegas provides. This ones for the adults 👍🏼
50,We stayed here during our wedding trip. Room was spacious and comfy bed! Shower was hot and good water pressure although the shower head sprayed everywhere like the holes were plugged and water went everywhere. Check in and it was easy the pool is beautiful although it was too cold to swim. We did enjoy the hot tub! Food at cravings was good! We ate there twice during our stay. We will stay here again!
30,"We have stayed at the Mirage several times in the past and we've always enjoyed our stays including our most recent stay (May 20 to 24). Our room was comfortable and clean (housekeeping was great) the pool area is still great and we enjoy the variety or restaurants and shows that the Mirage offers. Mirage's location can't be beat.    This most recent stay had a few misses which stood out however.    The first stand out was our experience with Mlife rewards (I realize this isn't the Mirage's issue entirely). My husband and I are both members and our accounts are linked. In the past we have gotten offers for free nights and/or credits at the resort. This past winter when we were looking to book: nothing. I inquired with Mlife to see if room offers aren't something that they do any longer and got an extremely vague response (basically just call us to book and we will answer your question). We are Pearl level members and all I could find was something like a 10% discount on already high rates (hotels are way more expensive than they used to be!) on the Mlife website. I ended up getting a room deal through MyVegas no problems there I guess. We had accumulated about 70 dollars worth of comps by the time we went to check out. I went to the rewards desk like I always have to have our points put towards our room charges. The only thing that they could offer was to comp our 50 dollar pool drink charge. That's ok I guess but at the end of my stay (when we're on our way out the door) I'm left with Express Comps that I essentially cannot use. We've had better experiences before where they have rounded us up a few bucks to take off a couple nights worth of resort fee. I don't know if MGM Resorts are struggling or something but everything felt stingy and like we were being nickeled and dimed.    The other issue we had was with the mobile check in. I checked us in at 6:20 AM Vegas time before we left home for our flight. We arrived at the Mirage around 2PM. I wasn't shocked that our room wasn't ready yet as it wasn't quite check in time so we got lunch. We returned to the mobile check in desk because we still hadn't gotten an email about our room being ready and it was past check in time. A very helpful person (Eddie I believe) helped us and got us a room. He did remark that the room that was assigned to us wouldn't have been ready for ""awhile"" so that it was good that we asked. I guess I don't understand what the point of getting in the queue for a room is? There were clearly rooms available that the system did not put us in. I feel like if it's past check in time that the system should assign you to an available room. I suspect that the system didn't because the room we ended up getting had a Strip view which I suspect they charge more for. This was just another example of us feeling like everything is about money.    I should add that I consider us to be very loyal MGM customers. We always stay with them and have have great experiences with Mlife and mobile check in previously (at the MGM Grand). We don't get to visit Las Vegas as much as we have in the past (at one point we were going 3 or 4 times a year) but we do feel like the perks are less than they used to be."
50,Annual May golf trip. Mirage has great value when smaller conventions are in town. Room is always clean and the facility itself is always clean and updated constantly. Baggage and front desk personnel very enthusiastic.
50,The MLife VIP Lounge Staff the room location security and casino staff made our vacation memorable and AWESOME! I highly recommend the 2 BD Suite! I'm already planning my return but into the Penthouse next year!
40,Great room overall service was great. Loved the Post Modern Jukebox show. Check it out. Room was well appointed and very clean. Staff friendly. Table gaming was fun and not pretentious. Was very satisfied with the stay.
10,Long lines when checking in. Requested room was not available. When I expressed frustration about the delay at checking in (compared to hotels like MGM Grand) I was told The Mirage is smaller and has less staff. My room also smelt like cigarettes on a non-smoking floor.
40,I have stayed here several times over the last 5 years because I like the location. My last two trips there have been problems with the online check in working correctly and my requests for a room near the elevator with handicapped accessibility. I travel at non-peak times so it's hard for me to understand why they can't get these things right. My room was very nice just not what I needed. I also find that resort fee added to the daily fee makes the real room rate very deceptive. Either include the fee in the room rate or give guests an option to not use the resort extras and don't charge them for that. I don't think the resort fee is exclusive to the Mirage I think you find it at all of the resorts but it is deceptive pricing everywhere.
10,Great experience all the way until checkout when I was told I had to pay an extra $675 in charges for a room upgrade.    Three days before I received a text to come to the front desk for a room upgrade. I came to the front desk and asked about it. The gentlemen informed me he had a room for me. I said okay as long as there was no extra charge. He stated there was no extra charge.    I repeated this question THREE times. Same answer. No charge.    We happily went to our upgraded room. I assumed I was getting this because of my use of the MLIFE Mastercard I had just received.    When I went to check out I was told I had to pay these extra charges (over $675). I refused. I explained what had happened.    They refused to accept my side of things.    I felt like I was scammed with a bait and switch tactic. I will never stay at the Mirage again because of this experience.
30,In the late 90's and 2000's I was a frequenter of the Mirage and after a recent stay for a friends birthday get-together was incredibly disappointed in the decline in hospitality and the overall cleanliness and upkeep of the property. Though the still keep the floors highly polished in the lobby.
50,Wonderful hotel. The decor is beautiful although it is beginning to show wear. Room are clean and spacious. Lots of choices for food. Love the automated check in and check out service. No standing in lines. Pool area is gorgeous.
40,The location is great within walking distance of other casinos and drugstores for cheap water. Also a nice size not to big and not to small. Tables mins are bit high but other casinos are close. Carnegie Deli Sandwiches are overloaded with meat ask for extra bread and condiments.
30,Things started out badly Check In was horrible. It was a long wait to be told there were no rooms ready but they were cleaning my room. They would call be as soon as it was ready. Worst case scenario it would be 3 PM.  I went back in an hour as I wasnt sure they had my cell phone number and had to wait a half hour again. Finally at 330 I still hadnt been called I went to the desk again and they gave me a room. I really think they were hoping Id kill time in the casino. I paid to be on the 24th floor and it did have an express elevator which was nice.  However the rooms were nothing special. No coffee pot No complimentary water Just overpriced snacks. The room was not spotless. There was dirt/mold on grout in shower. The bed was firm and I did not hear people in the other rooms BUT every time someone closed a door in that wing you could hear it slam. All night.    Housekeeping came while I was in room and I told them it was OK to clean but they really didnt clean and left trash on floor.    The food at the served at conference I attended was greasy. They had the strangest salad bar set up I have ever seen: lettuce wedges placed artistically but that essentially made it difficult to eat a salad.    I dont go to Vegas a lot but I would not choose this hotel.
20,received a phone call that my dog was barking profusely when in fact it was the guest who was partying outside and who were loud that caused disturbance to my dog . Is this what you call a pet friendly hotel ?
50,Stayed at Mirage 5 out of last 6 annual conferences great spot awesome pool for family too had a great time only knocked the rooms because they are getting a little tired mattress too soft they just need some renovations
40,After having a challenge at the Park MGM I was moved to the Mirage and had a great nights sleep with help from the amazing staff. Thank you for a flawless check in and a comfortable bed to rest my weary head on.
10,I arrived late at 1:30am and called the hotel 8 hours before that letting them know I’d be checking in late. My room was being cleaned and didn’t get in until 3:45am! 20 other people had the same prob.
10,The whole trip started out with bed wore out lab stopped uptub handle fell offfront door lock broke 3 times safe broke and tv broke.Spent a lot of time waiting on service men all on a six day vacation
30,The service was great and the food in the Pantry was good. However the bathroom was dirty upon entry - washcloths hanging from prior guests dirt on br floor already used lotion bottle and shattered glass outside the room door in the hall that I stepped on with shoes on fortunately. Management took care of everything.
50,I went down with my Best-friend and our daughters it was a fantastic place to go! I will be staying there again. Casino was clean did not smell of smoke as bad. Cravings Buffet was really good and LV burger great food!!
30,When booking my recent trip to Las Vegas I had no hesitation in returning to the Mirage having spent a week there previously nine years ago and having been impressed. On arriving at the Mirage little appeared to have changed and our room looked identical to the one from 2010. The beds in the rooms are very spacious and extremely confortable I would have loved to have taken the mattress home with me. WIFI is also available throughout the hotel for those guests requiring the internet. Unfortunately the housekeeping team are really letting the mirage down to the point where I would not return to the hotel in the future. You might be surprised to hear but having met up with an old school friend we went to bed most nights in the very early hours and as a result did not get up and leave our room until after 1pm on every day of our stay. On leaving our room we removed the privacy sign and noted that the housekeeping trolley was on our floor on each occasion. However each time we returned to our room it had not been made up. This led to us phoning and requesting more towels which were I have to say promptly delivered. At 10.30am on the third morning of our stay we were abruptly awoken by a male unsuccessfully (due to the metal bar across the door) trying to get his way into our room. My friend opened the door and the male was stating that our room hadn't been cleaned yet (talk about stating the obvious). We explained that we had been out all night and that we had displayed the privacy sign for a reason. We added that we would be out of our room in a few hours and that the room could be cleaned then. I struggled to get back to sleep so we vacated our room once again at around 1pm and returned several hours later to find....you guessed it......that it hadn't been cleaned. By now our pile of dirty towels was beginning to resemble the Luxor Hotel at the south of the strip. Once again we went out and once again we returned to bed in the early hours. Unfortunately this time having placed the privacy sign on the door we forgot to place the small metal bar across the door which prevents intrudors. What happened next I found to be both unbelievable and totally unacceptable. At 10.20am I opened my eyes to see the same male member of staff stood at the bottom of my bed looking at my undressed body. I was in total shock as he once again mentioned cleaning our room. I immediately ordered him from our room whilst covering up. Based on this experience alone I was going to award The Mirage a one star but having spoken to reception they apologised and I have reconsidered and decided to award it three. This experience put a dampener on our stay at the Mirage which was a shame as I actually like the central location on the strip of the hotel and found the room prices to represent reasonable value for money. We couldn't have been the only people in Las Vegas staying out late spending our money within the hotel resort and then wanting to get a few hours sleep and not being out of our rooms before lunch time. If you value your sleep and your privacy then I suggest that you look to book elsewhere as being woken up by a man stood at the bottom of your bed was a terrible experience.
50,I stayed for 5 days for a conference. I highly recommend the rooms on the 24th and 25th floor which have a dedicated express elevator! Check-in was online and ready on my arrival. The room was comfortable with a really nice king bed and quiet! Room service was quite good and prompt. This large resort has plenty of amenities. I used mostly the pool with several waterfalls plenty of chairs and complementary towels. The servers there were attentive as well. I don’t gamble so can’t comment on the casino. I’ve stayed at several properties over the years in Vegas and this was by far the best!
50,Of all the casinos I have stayed in the staff at Mirage was by far the most welcoming and friendly. Our second floor room was quiet and very convenient. Housekeeping was very responsive and provided excellent service.
40,We have stayed at the Mirage at least 5 times. While the hotel is a little bit dated it was clean and adequate. The reason for us to keep going back is the location to other hotels. We just walk across the street to Harrah's around the corner albeit long corners to go to the Wynn etc. Now back to the Mirage. The pool is nice the hot tub clean and they do have lounges in the shade. The food was good with many different choices and prices. Slot machines not so loose but you were able to get some play. Altogether a good vacation for us
10,I have travelled the world and been in the best hotels and this is the second time in 20 years that I make a bad review. The point is that I called the manager Mr Charlie Tran of the Mirage to explain that we had not had room service service i.e. no room cleansing. He turned out rude and bad mannered.
10,My family booked two rooms and stayed 4 nights. Hotel was outdated and I was underwhelmed but I made the best of it. We did enjoy the pool as it is very nicely landscaped with waterfalls and palm trees.  We were treated very poorly the night we checked out. We had a red eye flight to the east coast that was cancelled at the last minute at around 11:30 pm. After spending over an hour trying to secure another flight home the next day we found ourselves at 1 am with no where to stay. The EDC festival was in Vegas and hotel rooms were near impossible to find. Since we had just stayed at the Mirage I called to see if they had a room and was basically told they would not let me reserve a room after midnight. My family was stranded at the airport and after staying at the Mirage and paying for two rooms the call center wouldn’t even look for me to see if a room was available. I have since found out from the Mirage - I called them to tell them how poorly I was treated- that I was giving the wrong information and they do let you reserve a room up to 3 AM . I called several other hotels on the strip and all of them tried to find a room for me but by far the one hotel that was most helpful to me was the COSMO. They did not have an available room but they bent over backwards to help me. They didn’t even know me nor had I stayed there but they cared about me and my difficult situation. My family needed to sleep because the next day we needed to drive to Phoenix in order to get a flight home . They definitely have my business in the future and I will never stay at an MGM property again.
20,I stayed in a 2 bedroom penthouse suite on the 29th floor. The room should have had an excellent view of the strip and Mirage volcano but was obscured by the hideous Circ Du Soleil ad-screen. Also the tub constantly leaked water which was audible and disturbing the T.V.s were outdated and the electrical outlets need to be updated with USB connections. Also the food options in the hotel were very limited and many of the restaurants do not open until 11a.
30,The Mirage is an excellent location on The Strip. You can easily walk to many different things. But what we paid we expected more. We were traveling with three other couples - all who got into their rooms early (hours prior to check-in) except for us for some reason. I had to try to check-in three different times. The rooms are a good size but the bathrooms are incredibly tiny. Very little counter space and you can barely fit two people in there to try and get ready simultaneously (we just had the standard resort king room -- no other upgrades were available when we checked in because they were completely sold out....unless we wanted to pay an additional $75/night for a suite which we didn't but looking back we should have!). The shower is literally nothing to write home about - in fact our shower didn't drain and the shower head was awful. I stood in shower water every single time I showered. NOT what I expected with what we paid. The pool is nice and relatively quiet - no gimmicks (which we liked!). But get there early on the weekends if you want a chair. Chairs start to turnover around lunchtime but if you have a big group you might consider renting a cabana which are not cheap but if you split up the cost it's reasonable so you can all sit by one another. We did that - it was nice but you have to line up because they're on a first-come first-served basis so if you have a specific cabana in mind people start lining up by 9:15 AM for a 10AM check-in and someone with a casino host can outrank you even if they're not in line (no one told us about this aspect and I was not pleased after waiting). The drinks were good - get the 32 ounce drinks (they're pricey but more bang for your buck). The coconut-flavored mojito was EXCELLENT!  We did Yoga with the Dolphins one morning (you have to sign up in advance - they only have so much room - check with the spa) and it was AMAZING! Highly recommend!! Even if you're not staying at the hotel I guess you can still do it.  Overall with SO many amazing hotels on the strip I wouldn't stay here again. The experience wasn't what I thought it would be and there were too many (even though they were tiny issues) they started to add up to where I didn't feel valued as a non high-roller guest.
30,Hotel was very pricey. Food inside the hotel was expensive and not very good. Rooms were nice but in Vegas you don’t spend much time in your room. Line ups at Starbucks ridiculous in the morning for coffee. Nice pool. Casino very dated and dark there are nicer places on the strip
40,I recently stayed 4 nights at the Mirage for business and enjoyed my time there. I had stayed at Caesar's Palace previously and found that property to be just too crazy large. The Mirage is a nice size - easy to navigate but still containing everything you could ever want in terms of pool spa retail restaurants casual bites etc.    The highlights for me were the conference center itself - a very nice venue for large meetings!; the pool (love it!!!); and the great frozen yogurt shop near the pool entrance. They serve crepes too and I ate there a few too many times than I want to admit over 4 days!    The downsides for me were:  1) The Volcano. It's kitschy and honestly not all that large or impressive. It also is loud (even from the 30th floor where I was staying) and gets VERY old after the first night. A volcanic eruption three times a night is a bit much and I could have really done without this.    2) The room key cards (which also access the elevators) are finicky. You need to master a slow-pull technique or else they won't work at all. This could definitely be improved.    Overall though I would recommend staying at this hotel. Just be prepared to cringe every time the volcano starts if you're staying more than 1 or 2 nights! :)
40,Stayed for three nights at the Mirage. Everything was amazing. People were wonderful service was awesome and we had a great time! If there's one suggestion I could make please update your bathrooms. They're super small and the fan is terrible.
50,The Mirage is not the most luxorous or the best hotel in Las Vegas but it is a great option for those who want to save some money. The rooms are very nice the casino and restaurants are very good nothing extraordinary but nice.  The location is awesome in the best part of the Strip.
40,A fabulous hotel at a great end of the strip close to shops take aways attractions. We requested a room high up with 2 queen beds and got 18th floor. It was brilliant overlooking the volcano at the front. It was very quiet although the door was thin and you could hear people walking and talking down the corridor. Use earplugs if you are a light sleeper. The room was huge. There aren't many plug sockets by the bed or usb points (other hotels we stayed in had both at the base of lamps or clock radios which was great). No tea/coffee making facilities. There is a mini bar and fridge but it is operated by weight so if you take anything out or put anything in you get charged. We filled up the ice bucket to keep drinks cool. There is a long walk from the lobby through the casino to the guest elevators and no trolleys for bags. There are some good shops and restaurants. There is can all you can eat buffet with alcohol for $30 a head. The pool isn't massive and it is very noisy with loud music. Not a great place if you want to chill although if you have VIP access there is a separate pool. The Love show is spectacular and the volcano display at the front ofnthe hotel is a great thing to watch. I would stay again
40,Just got back from Vegas last week. Stayed at our favorite resort (The Mirage) for our 17th year. Loved the pool and the show Love. Had a great dinner at the Still. Staff and food was great! The rooms are starting to show their age. Overall a great trip.
50,Had a recent stay at the Mirage. The service was exceptional; everything from check-in to check-out; answering questions; at the bars and lounges. The room was very spacious compared to other MGM properties as well as others on the strip.
30,From my experience I feel like my stays at Hampton Inn Hyatt and Best Western hotels have been more enjoyable. There is no reason to charge an additional resort fee when essentially it covers internet and a few discounts.
40,We stayed at this hotel for three nights the check in was quick and painless but there were days where the queue has been around an hour.  The room was very spacious and probably the only place I didn't see a gambling machine. the hotel has a number of restaurants and bars to offer along with a few shops. but what I do recommend is the dolphin habitat which gives you a 3$ discount as a guest at the hotel.  we visited a few of the hotels on the strip and they all have different things to offer as we were happy with the Mirage we would probably try a different hotel next time.  There is a pool there and as we never used it I can't really offer an opinion but it looked awesome.  The staff are friendly and that's just not at the lobby that is everywhere from the restaurants to the bars to the shops.  The hotel is situated in the middle of the strip and has great hotels around a few within a 30 minute walk. Another option is the monorail which you can catch in Harrah's which is situated opposite the hotel. it costs 5$ a single trip or 13$ for 24 hrs from time of purchase.
50,The Mirage is in a beautiful location with an amazing pool. It has lots of restaurants that is accessible through the night as well as the day. The casino provided lots of drinks while Well play including excellent martinis
40,This trip was not as good as I would have hoped. Room didn’t get cleaned. Gfci kept getting tripped turning off the lights in the bathroom the toilet ran. My husband got gum on his new jeans at a restaurant gave ya a handicap room when we didn’t request one.
50,We love Mirages location & family fabulous pool with waterfall & foliage. Makes you feel like you are getting away to tropical island.Husband is real sweetiegets up early & gets us breakfast then waits in line to get pool loungers we like.We pay extra for Oasis pool the 1st day to get really rested.Room was extra clean & furnishings in excellent shape.Only problem was minor shower door leak.Had ton of fun at slots.Always feel safe at this casino.Love MLife program as we get free room offers.Can stay at any MGM properties but we enjoy the pool area & location here best.Will return this fall for more fun.
10,"Maybe it's a complete one-off but I had a terrible time with Mirage. They removed my early check in and told me my room was being ""upgraded"". When I was finally able to get in a room 4 hours later (arrived at around 1:30pm this was 5:30pm) it was only because I called again for a second time to see if I had a room ready.    There were multiple issues with the room (room safe drawer would not fully close no power to one of the phones no power to only alarm clock only power near the bed on the OTHER side of the bed from a very old power strip charging unit near the desk/tv connections came right out of the wall exposing the wiring behind it toilet/tub would randomly make extremely loud noises for 30m-1h at a time.    Beyond that the only service I was truly impressed with was the young lady that checked us in at the VERY beginning before things went horribly south and the Trainer for a Day Dolphin experience those folks were pretty cool.    I'm not going to pretend it was ALL one star but this chain did nothing to deal with my concerns whatsoever at any point once brought to their attention.    Thousands upon thousands of people still visit every year and I think they otherwise have decent reviews. This was probably a one-off. But this was me getting married to my sweetheart. I spent what is (to me maybe not to them) a lot of money for 4 nights in a hotel. I was really expecting something special from the pictures and my conversation when I called the hotel specifically to check on the rooms.    They will tell you they apologize for this or that inconvenience if something goes south but don't expect them to actually address it or take action. Once they've got your money what's the problem right?"
50,Second time to stay here and it remains one of our fave hotels in Vegas.    No frills hotel but clean rooms for a comfortable stay. We stayed in the stay well floor and our room was very comfortable and it smelled like a spa!    Location is great right in the strip. Spent our nights just strolling around to enjoy the sights and sounds of Vegas that never gets old - there’s always something new!
40,Always a pleasure to stay here. Good central location and plenty to do around it. Solid food choices. Not over the top service but worth a look if you want to stay in Vegas. Seems to be run very well. Rooms are always great. My third time here.
50,gorgeous hotel pool is amazing so big and very nice decor. Casino is very large and loads off different machines. Rooms are also very big and comfortable beds especially. Only complaint would be that the wifi is slow at times. Also recommend eating at the cravings buffae so worth it! Unlimited wine & beer and amazing food.
10,"The hotel is beautiful sportsbook is great pools are awesome (come early for good chair). There is a $15 parking fee per day. When we checked out of hotel we had over $100 room charge for the restaurant and room service that we never had. We were only there a couple days and did not use any bar or restaurant. The check out lady made us feel like criminals when we disputed the charge and said they will have to look at video footage to confirm our ""story"". What a horrible way to end a vacation. My wife is from Russia and felt this was discrimination. We are still waiting for the hotel to remove the charges."
10,On our first night in the hotel room my wife took a shower to begin our first night out and as she began to dry her self with the hotel towels provided in the bathroom she discovered dried up blood all over it. DISGUSTING!!! Pool service ( Waitresses-Chelsea) was horrible and rude. When using a players card make sure you verify every area you gamble on that they have timed you correctly. I was cheated out of several hours by the pit bosses at the black jack and crap tables. MIRAGE staff/management did nothing special to accommodate that disgusting towel.
30,Don’t waste your money or time to stay here. The rooms are outdated and smell like mildew. Customer service is horrible from the front desk. Just visit and go to the casino and the restaurants. But don’t get a room at the mirage
10,Checked into the hotel when I was given my room proceeded to my room hotel that the front desk chose for me. When I walked into my room there was 70 plus your old man sleeping in the bed I don’t know if I was embarrassed or he was but extremely awkward position to be in. Mind you this a 20min walk back and forth to the hotel check in. Proceeded back to hotel check in only for front desk employee to tell me there are no rooms available at this time. Keep in mind it’s 4:30 pm. Not 10 am or 12 past the appropriate time of check in. Immediately asked for manager. It took about 10min for a manger to come talk to me. Waiting in vip check in line I might add. Manager looks at me like I am the problem and caused this issue. Very unwelcoming and not warm. I am from NJ and go to Atlantic City all the time and not once over the yrs has an occurrence like this ever happened to be treated like poorly by staff. It’s true as they say coming to Las Vegas. There is no warm welcoming we are just cattle one person after the next. This manager said He would take care of my resort fees. I told him my room is a comp and I’m not paying for resort fees already as part of my hotel booking. He said he would put $150 towards the room for beverages which would be included in the notes. I had to make sure before I checked out to have that added back onto the room because the front desk manager never put those notes on my file for my room.    Also when I was finally given my room it wasn’t 20min I am doing work in my room on a conference call a hotel employee came into my room without notice to check in on me which I found very very disturbing. I do not know what is going on in this hotel but I will NEVER be staying at this hotel again.
30,The service was good rooms were clean but overall dated. Restaurants were also meh. Carnegie Deli had big servings but the service was poor - kept getting our orders wrong. I didn't try the buffet so can't comment on that. Also bought our tickets to LOVE at the ticket office and still got charged ticket master fees? Why? The Mirage would not be my first choice.
40,I have stayed at the Mirage many times over the years and they always seem to keep the property up to a good standard.The staff is very helpfulthe pool is very nice! (get a lounge early on weekend) California pizza kitchen is a great restaurant for food. The slot machines have gotten tighter in the past few years.\but remember For example From March 2015 to February 2016 a NEVADA GAMING CONTROL BOARD GAMING REVENUE REPORT shows that the “total gaming win” (the casino’s win) over twelve months from slots was $7066306000 (about 7 billion) total.They took the iron and ironing board out of the roomno coffee maker and no refrigerator the beds could use a change i think. The deodorizer they spry in the casino is over whelming.With saying all that this i would still stay there again!!!
50,Of all the hotels that we've stayed at on the strip this was the least expensive and in our opinion the best value.    We stayed in a King Tower Resort room on the 24th floor as we had been recommended. These rooms are only on the 24th and 25th floor so you get good views of either the strip / pool or the mountains. We had a view of the strip and the pool so were really lucky.    The room was clean and the bed was soooooo comfy as are all the beds in the MGM resorts we've stayed out. If we could have taken the mattress home we would have! The room had dual vanities which was great. There was both a bath and a decent sized shower. We couldn't access the fridge but this may have been because we chose not to leave a credit card open on the room for any incidentals.    The rooms on the 24th and 25th floor are only accessed by 2 lifts so it feels a bit more exclusive. Plus those lifts only go to those floors so no need to worry about overcrowding in the lifts.    The location of the hotel and casino on the strip is perfect. The size of the hotel and location is just right too. Not too big as to loose the atmosphere and not too small to feel pokey. Great selection of slot machines and tables. The buffet was also pretty good too although we only did the breakfast buffets.    All in all a great hotel and casino and we will definitely be back.
50,Extremely pleased with the entire experience at the mirage! The staff and employees were friendly and helpful at all time of the day! The room was clean and roomy and was very comfortable for my stay at the mirage.
30,Rooms are way outdated. Whenever people walkes by the room tou could hear them loud and clear. The TV signal was poor and choppy. The light was out in the restroom. The USB plugs are nowhere near the bed. And $48 dollar parking even as a guest. Never again.
50,We always stays at Mirage when we come to Vegas. It's our home away from home. Always great service and the staff are always friendly. They always makes a little extra to make you feel like home. Always a smile on their face and a good morning when you see them in the hallways. The Mirage will always be our home.
40,This was our first time to Las Vegas & we were there for our 29th anniversary. Very pleasant stay enjoyed the Beatles show immensely! The hotel was close to everything and there is great transportation there. The restaurants are very good in the hotel as well.
30,First trip to Vegas in May. Do not have any other resort to compare it to. If go later than May prepare for rooms to run warm. (Our experience)  Staff was extremely kind and helpful rooms were clean.  Average price for food $30+ per person per meal.
50,the mirage is very good place to stay in vegas the pool is beautiful the restaurant craving for the diner is the best in vegas the room with king bed is very confortable and clean this hotel is very clean and y would go again.
50,Clean and friendly place to stay plus more at the center of the strip . I’ve stayed there a few times and have always been pleased with the front desk staff as they are very helpful and make you feel welcomed. Rooms are nice clean and comfortable. Pool area is nice and clean . Friendly staff . Restaurants are great
40,Clean hotel clean casino smells good. Not too big not too small. Room was a little on the small side but modern and clean. Biggest complaint was there was no fridge in the room only their completely overpriced mini bar
40,This was my 5th visit to Las Vegas first time at The Mirage.  Very nice low key mellow resort with very nice amenities.  Stayed in a double room with Strip view decent no complaints.  Room size was fair and bathroom was alright not too small as everyone had mentioned and had me concerned no big deal there....  We absolutely loved the show BEATLES LOVE worth every penny.... unlike the slots at this casino. I know the casino is separate from the hotel and I respect that but I have played slots at a lot of casinos and this hotels slots were WEAK beyond pathetic tighter then tight. That just makes for a disappointment even if you are touring the strip and enjoying the other amenities. AVOID the slots here. Out of courtesy I'm telling you this better luck at the airport probably lol.  Great location for the Mirage and nice pool areal mind you the whole towel on the chair @ 9am sharp in effect. Clean respectable hotel would stay again but be leery of the slots!
20,I prefer a more sophisticated experience. Not enough places to eat breakfast and the one location has a line that is too long. Very disappointing  particularly since there is no  complimentary coffee or water in the guest rooms. The exercise space is too small for the number of guests in the hotel. I’ve stayed at other hotels in Vegas which were much more appealing.
40,"I can't say anything negative about my stay at the Mirage (except maybe that all casinos are mazes this one included). I was in town on business and as a result can't really say anything was outstanding either - I didn't partake in much outside of sleeping in my room or attending the conference I was in town for (except some poker which was plenty enjoyable but unsurprisingly not a particularly lucrative endeavor for me).    Blackout curtains worked well to recover from jetlag (and presumably hangovers) and there was little noise disturbing the night (I was on the 15th floor) - the only slight disturbance was the ""Volcano"" which did make enough noise to register and maybe to disturb a light sleeper but it only runs earlier evening and wouldn't typically disturb anyone spending time on the strip."
20,Overall not impressed with this hotel. The rooms were old and dirty. The air conditioning did not work and the check in line was horrible. Waited almost 45 minutes to check in. The only good thing about the hotel is the pool /
20,Vacation not happy. Charged much more at check out than expected. The service fee of 30 something was a joke it's a catch. The pool towels on every chair and noone using them noone out there watching .
30,Incredibly average is all I can say. I've stayed all over the strip and it's average. The location is great. The staff were very nice. But what bothered me the most was that although there were plenty of outlets and USB connections none were by the bed. So if you like your phone by the bed or you have a CPAP bring an extension cord. Another oddity was that the refrigerator in the room was stocked full. So if you wanted to chill a 6 pack of water or anything you have to request a refrigerator or they will charge you a restocking fee if you take anything out to make room for your stuff.
40,Everything about the hotel was great except the smell of cigarettes in the casino. Pool was great. Staff was great. Food was great. All other casinos we have been in Vegas didn't smell of cigarettes like the Mirage!
40,The Mirage hotel is a great place to stay down on the end of the strip easy access to all casinos the highway if you wanna leave or travel about the city and find other things other than the strip. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful one thing you have to watch when you check out make sure you didn't bump the snack bar in your Room even bumping it will cause charges on your bill so check your bill very carefully
50,Total resort environment! Didn’t feel like a casino - not smoky and has natural light coming from the beautiful atrium! Friendly staff nice room tons to do! Location is in the middle of all the Las Vegas excitement!
40,This hotel is perfectly located in centre of the Strip.Well furnishedspacious hotel room.Very Good value breakfast buffet with extensive variety of choice.Good service from lobby and car rental staff.Brilliant outdoor swimming pool complex.
40,We just returned from Las Vegas and this time we stayed at the Mirage. The hotel and room were very nice the bed was comfortable . . . But the room was loud. We heard lots of street noise train and the elevators inspire of being 6 rooms away from them. We were on 25th floor which had an express elevator that serviced only the 24 & 25 floors. The casino was nice and we dined in several restaurants on the property and enjoyed the beautiful pool.
40,We had a nice visit last weekend. The front desk was wonderful. We stayed in a King Tower Penthouse which I would recommend. The hotel was comfortable and in great walking distance to all places. The food is a bit overpriced but they give you big portions. We reserved a chair at the pool with an umbrella. As always the pool is fabulous but the service at the private pool is slow. I would pay for the chair again only because I need the umbrella that the pool comes with. The room was awesome so if you are thinking about upgrading I would say do it!! The only issue I had is someone in the hall or another room was smoking pot and it smelled awful. I would come back again.
10,Terrible room bathroom was tiny barely updated light bulbs out lamps and clocks unplugged dingy carpet messy pool area just not a 5 star hotel would not return never received mobile check in email. 👎🏻
50,Just came back from a 5 night stay. Room was clean and in great shape slots were friendly and just a fun overall atmosphere in the casino. Staff was fantastic and just seemed happy. Had a wonderful time and can't wait to go back.
50,This was my second trip to Vegas. First at Mirage. Last year was Venetian. I thought I would be disappointed because of the quality of the Venetian. Mirage was great. Met every one of my expectations.
50,We have stayed at the Mirage at least 35 times it has one of the best locations fantastic staff and a great location plus the pool is out of this world and it has some of the best restaurants and all of Vegas
50,"I have stayed at the Mirage several times and always enjoy it. This recent visit was no different. The laid back atmosphere tropical feel nice pool and very good gym for a ""hotel"" gym as well as staff friendliness are reasons we will be back."
30,Received a early morning call from staff indicating multiple complaints that our dog was barking. Not once did our dog bark. Staff should come to the door before repeatedly accusing us of a barking dog. She was not satisfied until three times and my voice getting louder. Unprofessional of this lady employee and who were these people complaining?? Obviously never came to my door
30,Here for a convention. Nice clean hotel desk registration employee was nice and courteous. There’s also a separate online check in which is a faster alternative to avoid the lines.  Casino was clean and there were lots of people playing and people who just want to have fun which is nice. Our room was spacious and there was a mini bar which we tried to avoid touching any of the sweets/water bottle or the fridge because we were warned that it is so sensitive you take one it charges you even if you didn’t open and took it back. So always check your charges/receipt!    Saw The Beatles cirque de soleil in the Love theatre...that I highly recommend you watch. You can get a ticket as low as $50 and have a great time. The colors acrobats and songs they were pretty fantastic!    Now there is a place to eat closer to the elevators (guests who stay there) called ‘The Pantry’. We ate breakfast there and the service was excellent! Very attentive fast and friendly! Food was hot and good. Then comes 10:30pm we got hungry again we came back and expecting the same service but oh boy it was the complete opposite! Service was slow and we couldn’t figure out who was serving us because there were like 4 different servers including the manager. Ordered Bloody Mary but couldn’t taste any alcohol in it. Ordered schnitzel but didn’t give us a sharp knife and when I was going to ask there was nobody in sight. After waiting for 2-3mins I gave up and just cut it through regular knife which I was struggling. We thought the workers were just then tired (but apparently this place is open 24h) so we thought it’s not worth the effort to complain. Before we left though the waitress took our plates and banged the plates it was loud and rude! I said ‘whoa’ but she completely ignored me. Anyway we found the manager (eventually) and complained about the service and rudeness we told them we didn’t leave a tip (we usually leave the full 20%) but had to erase it from the check. That wasn’t a pleasant experience! So guys breakfast is fast nice and pleasant there but we just look for a different place to eat at night. This is just my experience so I’m sharing it with you.
40,Everything was great. I think the only thing I struggled with was all of the cigarette smoke only because I brought my toddler. Obviously the whole strip is a smoking friendly environment I just wasn't prepared for it.
10,"There are much better places to stay in Vegas. After coming to Vegas 7-8 years for conferences the Mirage has been the worst experience ever. Paid for upgraded rooms. Nothing special at all. Checkin is a disaster. Mobile check-in absolutely does not work. Room is mediocre at best even though its an ""upgraded"" deluxe king tower room. Shower wouldn't drain. No prompt response to fix that. Told I would get access to the 1 OAK nightclub in the hotel. That was a lie... even offered $50 and was declined entrance. My friends had to leave to come out so we could go elswhere. Minimal lunch options... most dining doesn't open until 5. Having a conference here was absolutely terrible. Avoid the Mirage at all cost when you're in Vegas."
50,My girlfriend and I stayed here for a week at the end of April - Early May. We arrived at midday on the Saturday and although the queue to check in was relatively long we were at the desk within around 10 minutes which was fine. I tipped the guy on check-in and he gave us an upgrade to a pool view room on a high floor and also gave us 2 x complimentary buffets. He did also offer us a suite upgrade for the week at $75 a night but we decided against it as didn't plan to spend much time in the room.    The hotel as people have said previously is probably a little more dated than some on and around the strip but it really didn't take away from a brilliant stay. All staff that we came across were attentive friendly and provided us with the service we required.    The buffet restaurant was good quality and there was a wide range of options. We also ate at Carnegie Deli with a buy one get one free voucher via Mlife and it was really good food and service.    The casino had everything you could need and it was always possible to get a seat at a table or a slot. It helped that I won $900 on the final night playing Blackjack.    We loved our stay in Vegas and at The Mirage and would definitely stay here again.
20,Cockroaches in the room! Staff at CPK extremely rude....Now you allow dogs in the hotel? Is this a hotel or a pet store.. I suffer from allergies and should not be subjected to other people’s dogs...I’ve been staying here for 20 years when my wife and I travel to Las Vegas. We won’t be back. Next time we’ll be across the street at the Venetian.
50,Very nice employees staff members the only issue I had was the mobile check in and the windows are so dirty you cannot see outside but other in that it was beautiful the shows were fantastic and I would stay again
40,The standard rooms are not luxurious at all. However their suites are fantastic! The location is awesome. I really enjoyed the vibes of energy from this hotel. It wasn't too high end and snobby nor was it low end and cheesy.
30,Stayed 4 year ago and couldn’t fault the place so booked again for a week this April.    We had a number of issues over the week including wrong room number given at check in unable to charge to room when by the pool due to our check in guy not offering it to us but did to our friend for her room. Due to this we had a secondary holding fee put on the card.    In general the room was very dated scuffed furniture and huge dust piles in the corner of the room where the hoover clearly doesn’t reach.    We were given 2 days resort fee back as a sorry for our inconvenience over the week but I wouldn’t be rushing back unless they get a refurb.    Pool area was still lovely and no Vegas trip would be complete for us without a trip or 2 to Rhumbar.
20,The hotel itself is fine. But the check in was a nightmare. I did Mobile check in but it closes at 930 pm. about 100 people in line at 11pm. 2 agents on the desk. it took literally an hour to check in.    Pool: 930 am and all loungers are taken. people think its so clever to drop their towels and leave and hold loungers all day. No one at the pool checks on this. so no where at all to sit down.    I go to Vegas for ease and pool time. Neither were available. I'm simply not returning based on these two inconveniences.    (the starbucks/coffee shop by the pool also had an insanely long line that didn't move quickly. 45 min for coffee and a scone). No thanks.
50,This was our first time here at Majestic Mirage !!! The resort is absolutely beautiful!!! The beach is beautiful and clean!! We like the pools too! There’s a bar at the end of each pool!! Yay! We’ve tried so many different cuisines and it’s all amazing! All of the staff is very friendly and helpful! We have our own butler that takes care of all our needs!! All the drinks you want!! But the best fun and staff is the animation team!!!!! They’re so much fun and friendly!! Especially Alfredo and Beba  Justin  Johan  Salami Orianni & Melani!!! Love them All!!! Thanks for a great experience!!❤️
40,The casino section is showing its age with lower ceilings and subdued lighting. However the slot machines are first class and the newest models. The property has many shops and restaurants along with great entertainment venues.
50,Great hotel for a decent price on the strip. Hotel rooms were extra large and have a small table and chairs along with another sitting chair. Pool facilities very nice rented a cabana for a day which would have been nicer if it was by the pool but great service and comfortable to get out of the sun. Would stay here again
30,We were not impressed with the Mirage. Beautiful property however room was nothing fancy. No coffee maker so your forced to spend $5 for a coffee and theres a fridge however its stocked like avending machine with drinks snacks & liquor that if you touch any of it you are charged a small fortune for it and should you ask for an empty fridge its a $30 charge. Did not find the staff overly friendly either other then check in/out desk. It is in a nice location but personally would not stay here again
30,We had a good stay however we just couldn't get over the prices of anything. The small $1.50 water was $6.25. Sunscreen by the pool $21... it was ridiculous! I am still in shock. Staff was great no complaints there. Food was over priced but all very good.
50,Loved the Mirage...the ambiance made me feel like the experience was a Real vacation...excellent staff beautiful hotel & casino good location & good choices of delicious foods!!!...would stay there again & again!!!
50,I stayed in the Staywell rooms. It was an awesome experience with such great features. The air purifiers and lighting are great! When I read about all they do to clean the room it made me feel very comfortable.
50,My first time staying and it wont be the last! I them it was birthday and they simply took care of me. When i turned on the tv in the room . On the screen it greeted me happy birthday! Staff was friendly! I checked in with Cameron and he made it really hassle free and smooth experience!
50,I had a good 6 night stay for a conference. Comfortable bed helpful staff good restaurants good value and most of all a very central location to most destinations on the strip. I would stay again though next time I'll ask for a room with a view. I also wish the fitness center was open a little later (closes at 7:00 PM).
50,We love to stay at the Mirage. It is our favorite hotel. Service is always fantastic. Great room with great price! Perfect location on the strip. The food and pool are great! This is where we always stay when we come to Vegas.
40,Mirage was the first of the big resorts - it is starting to show show age and wear - needs a little face lift. But still a great location with very good restaurants. Need more lower limit options on tables. I see nobody sitting at $25 blackjack tables. Certainly better off have full $5 tables than empty $25 tables.
50,Stayed at the Mirage over the weekend. Beautiful hotel and a gorgeous pool complete with lots of palm trees! Pool gets very crowded so get there early for a good chair pool side. Friendly staff and lots of restaurants to choose from. Also has a Starbucks on property. Good location on the strip
30,I missed having my coffee first thing in the morning upon waking up. Room service is expensive and I don't want to get all dressed to go downstairs for a cup of coffee.  Also it would be more convenient to have more towels provided in the restroom. I think we had two large towels and two washcloths.  Accessible electrical outlets are needed bedside.
20,The Mirage charges you for everything from parking 2 Resort fees and a simple sandwich at their Cafe is $20    Has a member of their coveted mlife I did not receive any benefits and the room I stayed in was on the second floor
30,We went there for a charity event and the ballroom was very nice and clean as was the rest of the property. The food was good and we had good service. The only problem was getting out of the parking garage as we had to wait over 20 minutes and we had to pay to park. I will not return because of the parking fee.
50,We stayed at the Mirage and was very impressed. From checkin to our room with an amazing View of the strip. Room was clean and fresh and bed was super comfy. A great hotel to stay and we were overly impressed with the staff and how helpful they were. The pool was not to busy and overall we highly recommend this hotel
40,I have stayed here many times in the past 15 years and the hotel still looks nice and updated. Their bathroom could use more updating and your choices of restaurants on the site are line of limited but the location is great and there are always a lot of other choices for entertainment nearby.
40,Stayed at the Mirage in April. First time staying there and it wasn't bad but there are certainly nicer places on the strip these days. We have visited the Mirage many times over several years but decided to try it out as our home base for the first time and it was about what we expected. Room was OK but a bit outdated hallways smelled a bit at times as well. Had casual lunches at a couple places and both were fine. Did a pool day and it was good but they cram you in a bit...we tried to reserve seats a week before but they cant guarantee spots together so we just went down around 8:30am one morning and got 6 together. It was packed by 9:30am. Have had much better pool days at Wynn Bellagio and Cosmo for sure. I really like the casino I think the vibe is usually fun always seemed busy but never crazy crowded. We will definitely visit there again for some casino action but unlikely to stay there
10,Absolutely outrageous room charges made to our room. I tried to talk to Wendy from the front desk but no help there. Will try to contest it with the credit card but needless to say we will never stay there again.
50,"location was great. wish the room had a coffee pot microwave and fridge but none of them on the strip do. everyone was very friendly. room was very quiet. safe area and hotel. price is decent but everything else is overpriced but again so is everything else on the strip. buffet was ""ok"" at best but free wine/beer while you're there so you probably get your money's worth."
30,The overall stay was very good. As I mentioned in my survey my room has an 'odor' and there was no way to get fresh air. The carpet was also wet in spots when I initially checked in. The rooms need to be updated.
50,Always a pleasure staying at the Mirage. Wonderful staff restaurants and pool. Clean rooms - nice casino and sports area. Close to the mall and moments from the strip. This is our go-to place in Las Vegas!
50,great strip view room can walk everywhere from there a bit of a queue at check in but once that was done we went to our room nice and clean and comfortable beds would denfinalty stay again cant wait to rebook
20,This is my second stay in a row where I have had to sit at the check out counter for 20 minutes (making us late for our brunch reservation) arguing to actually pay the agreed about room rate. They were trying to sneak an extra $1000 of room charge on our account.    Never received an apology for their mistake and they made me feel like it was somehow my fault. Noir Mlife status is pretty worthless when it comes to getting competent service or really any benefit.    Hotel itself is fine. 2 bedroom penthouse suites are pretty comparable to the suites at some of the higher tier properties.
50,The staff was friendly and helpful. Room and view were amazing. Pool was beautiful. The buffet was great with lots to choose from. If you get a chance the VIP dolphin tour was amazing and so much fun!
50,A really liked our stay at The Mirage. The room was great (the view was not so great but it didn’t really matter) nice pool area nice outside bars (Dolphin and Rhumbar). Self parking worked well. Can only recommend it.
50,We first stayed at New York New York and was not pleased with the hotel or service so we got a night at the mirage and had a great time the casino was nicer and loose than most of the other casinos on the strip
20,"We always stay at the mirage when we go to vegas. We like the location and we like the pool.  HOWEVER this is how we were treated this year:  We were told we had a ""volcano view"" room we had a view of the roof of the casino and you could ALMOST see the volcano show.  We noticed almost immediately that our safe in the room didn't have a keypad to lock it which to their credit sent someone up to fix it right away.  About twenty minutes later we discovered the bathroom light wouldn't turn on so we called about that they asked us to keep hitting the reset button until the lights came on.  About ten minutes after that we discovered the toilet would barely flushed. When I called down for the third time I asked to get a new room (on a monday) to which they told me the were COMPLETELY full. And when I mentioned the toilet I was told ""Just so you're AWARE the mirage has lower water pressure than some smaller hotels"" but the shower had so much power it could powerwash the paint off a car. By the end of our week the toilet was leaking water on the bathroom floor (never rectified)  We told the concierge about it she gave us a pass for two (instead of the four staying in the room) to the mirage buffet or two to the dolphin exhibit that there is apparently no discount for hotel guests (over $20 a person) When we went to use the $50 credit toward the buffet we were told rudely that even though we didn't use the full $50 it was only good for two people. We then wanted to pay for the second two people and she automatically charged it to the room without asking and when we said we weren't putting it on the room DEBBIE rolled her eyes said she had to get a manager and huffed off. After we were sat (directly behind the register) we could hear Debbie loudly complaining about us to her coworker.  The buffet was NOT good either. The day before we had been told 3 different prices for what the buffet would cost. Two of the different prices were given to us by the same woman.  I will say that the staff at the pool and the housekeeping staff were much friendlier and helpful than the rest of the Mirage staff that we encountered and we will be staying elsewhere"
40,I have no complaints about this hotel. Great location on the strip and the staff are very friendly. It’s a bit pricy but so are the other hotels on the strip in that vicinity. The pool area is nice too. Overall I’d probably book again if I could find a good deal on it. May is an excellent time to visit Vegas for me having come down from Canada.
50,Every single service was top notch from bellhop housekeeping dining concierge casino and Mlife staff. Everyone on staff was very friendly and helpful. The Volcano room along with a view of the strip was an added perk as well!!!
30,Recently stayed here for a long weekend. The stay was good but the rooms are definitely showing their age. The bathroom showed it's age as significant water spilled on the floor. You could barely use the second sink without the door getting in the way. Be carefull of the water. The hot water gets extremely hot in the sink. The room was comfortable enough. However there no accessible outlets near the bed. The pool was good but crowded as expected. Overall this was a good stay and I would stay here again.
40,Not a bad hotel. Reception was nice and easy. TV is full of ads when you try to turn it off really weird. AC didnt get very cool at all and room was constantly stuffy which isn’t great while trying to rest and recover.
40,Make sure you don't let them talk you into a handicap accessible room unless you need one. The bathroom is awful! And we didn't want two queen beds; that was the alternative they offered us. However the bed was so comfortable and the sheets were great!
50,The staff is very helpful and friendly. The room is very nice and clean. The casino is huge. Plenty of fun machines. The restaurants are expensive but the buffet is really good and worth the money. Will definitely be coming back!
10,Room smelled during our whole stay.  One of the two bathroom sinks had a broken faucet with the handles stuck under the mirror.  The bathroom lights died. Turned out they were tied to the GFCI which popped when we turned the lights on.  It's a dump. Not going back.
50,Mobile check-in process is fast and easy. Room was clean and updated but there wasn't a plug-in to charge your phone next to the bed - just by the desk. Pool area was nice but there is only one large pool - other resorts have several different pools. There was a hot tub. Snacks are expensive but that is to be expected when you stay on the strip. Overall I would stay here again.
50,Went for a conference. Good location and good staff  Room was clean staff was good location was good we had no issues that were not resolved to our satisfaction. I would recommend this hotel. On the strip which is nice
50,We were very impressed with the casino. Even though there was smoking it wasn’t overpowering. And when we got home my clothes did not smell like smoke at all. The taxis are there waiting for you if you want to go to another casino for a show. I loved the pool area. Enjoyed watching the dolphins and going through the Secret garden. The volcano eruption was very entertaining to watch every night. It sure added to the excitement on the strip. The Mirage is located in the middle of the strip
30,Throughout my stay I had issues with my key card. The excuse I kept getting was the hotel is old. The first room was very smoky and we had to switch rooms. Paid for early check in but didn’t get what was promised. On the bright side it’s centrally locates on the strip which was nice.
30,Rooms are spacious but the key did not always work and acoustics were terrible. Casino is good an restaurants are okay. Pool is nothing fancy either. The convention site is okay and the elevators can get very crowded for conferences.
50,We have been staying at the Mirage for years and it remains our go to destination in Las Vegas. The consistency over the years is impressive maintaining and improving the stay experience. Service from the valet and bell staff along with the mobile check in procedure made our arrival trouble free. Our room was nicely appointed and immaculate. House keeping was prompt and nearly transparent. We ate at The Pantry Osteria Costa and the Carnegie Deli enjoying the fare at each and were impressed by the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. For us the location is superb and the Mirage will continue to be our first choice on the Strip.
20,Location is great. We have stayed here at least ten times over the years mostly because we received comped rooms. But each time it has become a poorer value with lesser service. This may have been our last stay.
50,I stayed here with my husband and seven year old son before heading home after a week in the Utah parks. The check in staff was very friendly. Something he pointed out to us that I thought I would share - because we were staying at an MGM hotel and were M rewards member ( which is free to sign up for) We could get a discount for shows at all MGM hotels during our stay. Also the self park cost fifteen dollars BUT you could also use your key card to park for free at any of the other mgm properties which is a huge perk and money saver if you want to check out the other MGM properties on the strip. The hotel obviously has a large casino but the walk from check in to the guest elevators did not smell like smoke. We chose to spend an extra twenty bucks for a strip view which was great for a seven year old who had to get to bed early but still wanted to see all the lights and the volcano show from above. He also loved the aquarium located behind the checkin desk And of course the pool was fantastiic. We were there on a Friday afternoon and although the majority of people there were adults I did not feel out of place with my child. Had to remind him a few times not to splash. Difficult to find lounge chairs together but we were able to find two together even though we got there at about three. Only bad thing I can say was the pool bar service - my sixteen dollar drink consisted of shots dumped at the bottom of the cup and then a squirt of frozen stuff plopped in the center.I had to stir it up myself.    The hotel is also right across the street from a complex which includes several reasonably priced food options (McDonald’s and Panda Express) . The MGM IS centrally Located and we could walk to Caesar’s and the Bellagio as well as many other reaorts. We would definitely stay here again. My husband and son went to bed early and I went down to gamble a it on my own. Room was large updated and clean. Keep in mind the rules about the minibar- as soon as you pick up something you get charged. Good to warm little ones of this.
20,"Couldn't even get the basic uses from the hotel room like a draining bath tub. The drain water wasn't slow it was stopped 3-4"" from my first shower for 12+ hours. Insulting to have to pay a ""$160+ resort fee"" for basic stuff that should be checked makes me think the bath tub was never cleaned or they would have known it wasn't draining. People pee among other things in bath tubs and I was standing in the drain water gross. Would that bother you? I am not the type to complain about things either I called after the first time I noticed when I came back to my room the tub was empty I took a shower later and low and behold it backed up again ridiculous. Called again and told Wendy she credited my resort fee for 2 days honestly it should have been the entire resort fee credited I would have been satisfied with that. Other issues were my room alarm clock didn't work and had exposed wires I stayed with a group and we had 4 rooms in total another rooms clock did not work either. Also 2 of the headboards had ripped torn fabric and one of the rooms didn't have one at all. I most likely would not stay at this hotel again or recommend it and would try another one instead. I would love if someone contacted me and wanted to try and make this right that would be great customer service sincerely Jon"
10,Booked hotel room months in advance and got the specific room my girlfriend wanted which was the Resort Tower King Room with the big bathroom. She was so excited because we would be on the top with the private elevator and she really wanted to see the bathroom.  The whole reason we chose THIS resort was for THAT room. I had done my research on all the hotels and had all these different resorts lined up but she chose this one.  So we get there on time too exactly when check in starts at 3pm. To find out our room has been overbooked and we have no choice but to DOWNGRADE? Like Seriously? To a super low level room or a handicap room.  She was so excited on the way to vegas to have it all ruined? Not only that but we got there literally on time for check in we should of been one of the first on the priority list to get that room especially when we booked our room months in advance.    Totally a waste of Vegas trip and her birthday killed the vibes from the moment we got there. Wasted all my time researching different vegas rooms. Supposed to be coming back this summer and definitely will not be here sadly.  Really disappointed because I liked this resort before but now I will never risk coming back.
30,Room smelled like stale smoke. I liked the extra security especially later in the night they would check our room keys before letting us in the elevators. We also needed help and security was very helpful when we were locked out of our room.
40,"The Pros.    1. Service is great the concierge gave us the best advice to get our tickets for the Aerosmith concert. Very well done. Also maintenance team was awesome.  2. Location. Be prepare to walk a lot anywhere in Vegas but Mirage has a good location.  3. The rooms were in good condition. But I would slight improve the bathroom.    The Cons.  1. Something I do not understand is that Rooms promote ""stay-well"" floor but lobby and casino is awful in regards to the cigarette smell. But I guess is not an option for the Vegas to ban smoke in Casino. It is contradictory and bad if you are a non smoker and/or have children.  2. Valet Parking scratch my rented car. Not major issues but still Valet parking requires better training for big trucks. Manager was good handling the situation but still took 30 min of my time not even a discount on the fee."
50,I love the mirage. My room was a corner unit where I had a view of the strip on two sides. The staff were extremely friendly the property is slightly quieter than some other MGM property options and the food options are great. This was my second stay here and it continues to be one of my favorite properties.
50,We are in a pattern of trying to go away twice a year. And the ONLY place my husband wants to go it to Vegas and stay at the Mirage. We have been there so many times it's like home away from home. VIP treatment from limo pick up to VIP lounge (which is the best!) comp shows...for the most part...and suite comp for 4 nights. They really do value their guests. our suite never has a view since we really never ask and it's a comp but it's always lovely and spotless. A great selection of places to eat and drink. I do wish they would get different slot machines. Any time I find one I like they eliminate it. They do not have enough video poker machines. From walking in to other casinos they seem to have the basic machines. (not that it matters because we NEVER win anymore LOL) But the Bellagio and Ceasar;s both have a betteer selection of games. I would love to stay at another property once to compare but my husband won't budge. He should do a commercial for the Mirage!!! But really you can't go wrong by staying here!
50,Really enjoyed staying at the Mirage. Felt I was in a high class establishment and the Italian restaurant was great. The room was beautiful and clean and comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful. I will look forward to staying at the Mirage again.
50,This is our 7th or so time staying at the Mirage and not disappointed. We really like this resort/ casino and have always been treated very well. We have never had issues or concerns will return for sure.
10,Have stayed at the Mirage more then a dozen times. This trip put us over the top with complaints. Our initiall room assignment would have flunked any health inspection. We found mold dripping from the underneathe the rim of the sink ripped and torn headboard mold in the folds of the shower curtain. When I requested a new room  I was told I would have wit 4-5 hours. Total disregard for customer satisfaction!
50,My VIP host Willie literally is what makes this trip worth it!  We love staying at the mirage because of how we're treated and taken care of we LOVE the pool the food and the gaming is always on point!
50,Long a fan of the Venetian I'm now hooked on The Mirage! My husband and I enjoyed an amazingly spacious one-bedroom suite that was actually much less than the Venetian with larger space and wall to ceiling windows. The rooms was modern and well appointed and we had so much space to enjoy a combined business/pleasure weekend away. I highly recommend the hotel. The pool grounds are wonderful as well.
50,This is one of the most fantastic places I have ever stayed. The views of the mountains and the town from the sitting room are just superb. My friend was unwell and the owners were incredibly kind supplying special food and hot water bottles. It was utterly memorable in every way.
40,"Stayed for just a night on the way back through Vegas so booked this as cheaper option than the Cosmo which we'd stayed in earlier in the week.    Not sure what room type we had as the itinerary from our agent said ""standard room"" but this isn't an option on the hotel website. The room was huge and clean. Obviously an older hotel and a completely different vibe to the Cosmo in terms of decor but ok!    Hotel has lots of self-parking which was great as we had a hire car ($15 per 24 hours). There is a resort fee like every Vegas hotel ($37 per day) so make sure you factor this in. It basically cost us $37 to use the internet!    Good location next to Ceasars and opposite the Venetian. We didn't use any of the hotel facilities like the pool as we were only there for a short time. We did go to the Beatles LOVE show earlier in the week which was spectacular (and expensive).    Overall it was ideal for what we were looking for in a reasonably priced stopover. The Cosmo was on another level but then so was the room price."
50,Wow a fantastic and lively hotel . We felt very safe and accommodating by all members of staff. This hotel has soo much to offer with restaurants and bars as well as the outdoors with dolphins and white lions by Siegfried and Roy . The pool is immense with cabanas located around if you wanted privacy . Being a platinum member of m life  it was great to use for the gambling side of things and the concierge were very helpful with bookings for shows etc . My host Celina Navarro was a pleasure to meet and full commendation to her for meeting us and being our point of call soo helpful and approachable nothing was a problem. I look forward to seeing her again soon if I get my NOIR invite lol .  Thanks Mirage and special thanks to Celina for making our trip very special.  Kind regards  Brian & Jacqueline
40,The staff was very friendly and helpful. Check in and out was very easy with the mobile app. Staff in casino were great keeping the drinks coming and keeping everything clean. The Heritage Steakhouse was beyond great and the Carnegie Deli goes great breakfast. The buffet was also very good.
10,I was harassed and illegally detained by mirage security. They initially tried to stop me when I came out of my hotel room and I asked the security if I was under arrest or being detained and he answered no to both so I walked away. He called more security and cornered me and said I had to get my belongings and leave just cause I didn't want to talk to them. As we proceeded back up to my room one security tried to grab my arm even tho I agreed to go back and get my stuff and leave. Once up at my room they told me to step back and when I refused they threw me against the wall and cuffed me. They took me downstairs to an office area and cuffed me to a metal pipe on the wall. I asked them why are they arresting/detaining me and they couldn't give me an answer literally couldn't. I asked them under what Nevada statute do they have the right to detain me and no one could answer me. I told them since they're cuffing me like an animal to a pipe on the wall then I want my lawyer and they wouldn't let me call for legal representation. I asked to speak to the supervisor and was also denied. After about 3 hrs of being cuffed to the wall vegas pd finally came. They asked me what happened told them what happened in front of all the security and they had nothing to say. Vegas pd released me but mirage security kicked me out and banned me from all MGM property. On top of that I was only there for 1 night and they charged me for 3 nights and refunded me only $240 out of the $300 security deposit for the room. Nothing was broken or missing in the room. Horrible experience. Stay away from mirage. Spend your money elsewhere where they actually value and care about their guest. Beware of their security they're power hungry and go on power trips.
50,Stayed for three nights and four days over 4th of July weekend. Yes it was 120 degrees outside but it didn't matter at this beautiful Oasis. The Mirage buffet for breakfast is an absolute must. With unlimited champagne mimosas it was a great way to start off a pool day.
30,Was treated like a homeless person trying to get a hand out for wanting a refill on our coffee. Purchased a coffee went back to our room came back down and couldn't get a refill even tried paying finally got her to give me a cup of coffee paid for it again. By the way there was no coffee maker in the room and we were paying guests. I think it is very unreasonable to not be able to get a refill on a $6. 8 oz cup of coffee and be treated rudely by staff in the process.
40,"If you like gambling/video poker---this is a wonderful place. Have really good payouts.  And Jimmy the bar tender is ""intense"" but so efficient and a super nice guy. Meet a lot of nice/interesting people.  Also have a most amazing casino host -ever...Chilie Willie!  This is merely my experience over the past 25+ years.But --Good Luck!!!"
50,Staff was the best!!! Clean hotel and WONDERFUL FOOD! Restaurants are a bit pricey but thats everywhere in VEGAS!!  We were upgraded at check in because my mothers room needed to be close to the elevator and they noticed on the computer it wasn't. Everyone was so kind and helpful and the casino had great games and although we didn't leave millionaires we had fun and left with money!!!!
50,Location is right on strip. Staff was friendly and rooms were clean quiet and up to date. Price was very reasonable! I wish we would of stayed at this resort the entire trip. Next trip we will definitely be staying here. Can’t beat the price location and the casino has a lot of choices as far as restaurants and stores.
10,The room smells and had headache all.night don't know why and room service was way too expensive...wanted a cup of hot water 15.00 wanted 1 cup of coffee and they don't serve for one only for 5.people
40,This was my second time staying at Mirage the first was in 2009. The staff are friendly the rooms are clean and spacious but bathroom is rather small. I was charged a resort fee to include spa fitness center WiFi access and one other thing...but the WiFi service was poor. Chose other places outside Mirage to eat so I cannot speak about that service for this trip but back in 2009 the options were slightly overpriced in my opinion.
20,The Mirage is nice overall but you need to wait in line for at least 30 minutes before the pool opens to get a chair. There are no coffee pots in guest rooms which forces you to but a $6-7 coffee every day and inconvenient if you want to just relax in the room a bit. Buffet was overpriced. Resort fees are too high.
50,Great location. Very easy to get around the hotel/ casino. It's a big place but it doesn't feel that way. Restaurants there are amazing too. Staff was friendly.  The Siegfried and Roy attraction there was a great hidden gem in the hustle and bustle. Loved it and will be back.
20,My daughter wished to celebrate her birthday in Vegas around the well advertised pool and so we booked 3 a 3 day stay. We had NO housekeeping service the entire 3 days. We left the room in the morning or afternoon and since Vegas is a 24 hour city...we expected to come back and collapse into a clean bed and bathroom. Not the case. We absolutely did NOT leave a Do Not Disturb sign on the door. We know better. The last day my flight was at 10 pm so I requested a 3 pm late checkout. The maid started knocking on our door at 11 a.m. The quality of the guests is not inspiring either. We went over to the Bellagio and the quality of the entire place was much better.
50,Just spent 4 days 3 nights at this hotel. The room was on the 16th floor near the elevator and the vending machines They also have mobile check-in if you don't want to wait in line. The hotel decor reminds you of the islands and it has a spa and fitness room for those who want to work out or just relax. There is a buffet several restaurants places to unwind with a cocktail and for the young at heart over 21 there is 1 Oak which offers a DJ and dancing. There are shops as well. All in all I enjoyed my stay and would recommend it.
10,We stayed for one night in March. Booked two rooms with a strip view. Our 2nd floor room looked at the roof and a/c handlers (or some other machinery...). Maybe if we had gotten on the chair and peered way to the left or right we could have caught a glimpse of the strip. Called down to see if we could switch room and were told that the price point we booked at was floors 2-11 and they were fully booked. Mind you this was a non-holiday Tuesday... and we had booked the room months before. Every public space in the Mirage felt dirty and smelled of smoke. We couldn't wait to leave. Def would never go back.
50,Our company recently stayed at the Mirage for our conference in Las Vegas.  This was my first time to this Hotel and had a fantastic stay. It ranks right up there with other great hotels in the area. All of the staff was helpful and friendly. There are good food options and gambling options.  The pool here is unbelievable! I recommend checking out the Mirage!
50,Stayed at the Mirage Cinco De Mayo weekend for a friend’s wedding. Had a great experience.. great room and great service!!!! We decided to change our reservation from another hotel to the Mirage the morning of our trip and received a great deal.
50,Oh my Lord! So happy and joyful clean. And wonderful rooms with great accommodation and toiletries! I found the linens to be of high quality. In the rooms to be a great design an experience! The bell staff and parking was perfect. Very safe very secure and a wonderful place for kids also! I highly recommend this place to any and all humans of America! Give them a call they’re wonderful company was a great location and very safe and secure. With quality food and entertainment nearby! Enjoy your travel service
50,This is my favorite hotel in Vegas! The Location is TOP NOTCH easy to get to anywhere great food and prices and you actually have no need to even leave there! Not to mention the comfort of the beds and the cleaniness!
40,I enjoyed the Mirage and the beautiful lush grounds with many waterfalls and fragrant flowers on several acres! The inside also had a lovely waterfall and foliage that made for a pleasant atmosphere. The restaurants inside were nice with a good variety and nice shopping. Rooms were comfortable. Bathrooms are too small. Pool area is amazing with the winding paths of many pools and foliage all around. Nice bars around the pool.
30,I reserved a fountain view room and was told there were none available when i arrived well after check in. I was given a suite for the night about 6 hours so i can sleep and then i was given a standard room not the room i reserved. The whole event delayed being able to unpack and get comfortable to begin the stay.
50,had a great girls weekend away and we were so impressed with our rooms at The Mirage! 3 large long mirrors outside the bathroom meant that we could all get ready at the same time! Loved that! Very spacious rooms! And of course they're pool is awesome!
50,This was our first trip to Vegas we stayed at the Mirage picked it because of location and pool. It was fabulous. No complaints. Nice room great bed great selection of restaurants. Loved the private tucked away tropical pool area. Definitely would stay again.
30,Great location. Rhumbar was great and so was the Pool Pool waitress service and pool restaurant food and service was also excellent. Centre Bar needs to provide more waitresses for better client service.
30,The check in time is shown to be 3 p.m. our room was not ready until 5 p.m. and I had to go back to guest services to get a room or I would have still been waiting. After returning to check in desk i was told would be another hour or so but they had a room with less of a view than i reserved available right now. So my choice was less or wait. Not what i expected from the Mirage.
50,We love the Mirage! We come here every year! Beautiful atmosphere! Service is always great! Pool is awesome! Food is great! We are already planning our next trip for next year! We do not have one bad thing to say about it! Keep up the good work!
50,This was our first trip to Vegas and we walked into almost every hotel on the strip and we were so happy we chose the Mirage. Very nice hotel didn't meet a bad staff member. Great location. Highly recommend this hotel.
30,If you're looking for a cheap hotel then this is a good hotel to stay. But don't expect a full amenities because they didn't even have coffee machines in the room. Location-wise is perfect. You can cross the street to go to Venetian and places to eat is convenient.
50,My wife and I stayed at the Mirage last weekend. Check in staff was so nice room was great location eas great. Absolutely loved Carnegie's Deli! Had an amazing Turkey club that fed us both and the cheesecake was one of the best in my life!
40,My husband and I stayed at the Mirage for 5 nights. The location is great because it’s right in the middle of the strip and the bus stop is right out front. Clean rooms with modern decor best pool ambiance on the strip (and clean!) friendly staff attentive casino cocktail servers. Other than a mini fridge costing $35 a night (we opted to just use an ice bucket) we really had nothing to complain about! The buffet (cravings) was awesome and the drinks at Still were on point. Unless you were sitting next to someone smoking you would never notice that smoking was allowed in the casinos. The illuminated makup mirror in the bathroom was a lovely touch! We really enjoyed our stay and would totally book this hotel again!
50,It was such a pleasure to stay at this resort. Everyone was so helpful. Such a beautiful pool that they have employees were helpful. Everything is a little pricey however you would expect that in Las Vegas. Again it was such a pleasure to stay there
40,overall I was satisfied with my 1st stay at the Mirage in Las Vegas and I would refer others and would revisit the hotel again. There was no issues that I encountered during my stay for business event
10,The hotel/casino experience is pretty similar regardless of which one you choose. However my guest room at the Mirage left a lot to be desired. Scuff marks peeling furniture etc. If you're looking for in-room amenities go elsewhere.
50,excellent experience at this hotel this is an older strip hotel with a good name hotel has been kept up and has great location on strip. Room was very clean and functional staff was great and they have a very large pool area which is well maintained. Housekeeping staff went extra mile to provide a portable refrigerator to store my wife's insulin.
10,Booked online which states all taxes and service charges included. Got to the resort and upon checking in where I thought everything was prepaid they then added on an extorniate resort fee of almost 100usd.1 star for hiding costs.
10,Stay at this hotel in the past. Went back because of the pool that our son loves. The temp used to be a warm tropical temperature. But this stay the heater was not working and the water temp was so cold you couldn't be in it for more then 15 minutes at a time. Was a wasted stay at this hotel.
30,I stayed in a Queen room on the 23rd floor for a one night stay. The room was nice enough beds were comfy room was mostly clean. There were 2 spots on the tub which i fervently hope were rust but they looked like blood. The shower was OK nothing special. The water got VERY hot quickly so make sure you open both taps or you may get a scald.  Main complaint is that the minibar in the frig was FULL of items. We were warned by the check in staff that the items on the minibar were on a weight sensor so if you removed anything you would be charged for it whether you actually consumed it or not. So where we had an OK dinner in the Italian restaurant we had no place to stash left overs. There is a little plaque inside the frig warning you if you take anything out you would be charged so call housekeeping if you need a frig for storage as they can provide one. The plaque neglected to mention that the hotel will charge you 35$ a night for the frig.  No coffee maker or microwave in the room which i believe is pretty standard for Vegas but might be a surprise to a first time visitor.  Parking was 15$/24 hours but at least you had in/out privileges if you wanted to do out in the evening.  Pool looked nice but closed at 7pm so we did not get a chance to use it.  Overall for the 114$ room rate the room was fine. I would not have been interested in staying there for a higher rate particularly with the slew of unavoidable add on charges.
50,Have stayed and the Mirage multiple times. Would highly recommend it if you like a bit smaller property. Things are easily accessible and doesn’t take a long time to get from point A to point B. The pool is fabulous and the staff is wonderful
20,I was provided keys to a room that was already occupied. There was no sense of urgency and no apology about the mix-up. Unable to connect to the internet. Internet fees are part of the resort fees. Everything in the room was worn-out - carpet was dirty the bathtub wasn't very clean either. For the price and location they need to up their game. Save your time and money and go somewhere else.
30,Just getting back from my 7th time in Vegas but first time staying at the Mirage. The best part about the hotel is definitely the location having stayed at the Cosmo Paris and Bellagio previously I found the Mirage to be a short distance to pretty well everywhere. During my previous trips I had played on the Mirage casino floor mostly slots so I knew what to expect and always enjoyed myself. What I did not expect is staying in a room for 8 nights that reeked of cigarette smoke and mold/mildew. While I realize that 4 of my 8 nights were comped I did not think I would be put in such a dump after all earning 4 complimentary nights would normally mean that I have already spent quite a bit of money supporting this hotel during my previous stays. I did ask to be changed to another room or even pay for an upgrade but they could not accommodate me. They did send a maintenance guy to my room on the 2nd day with what front desk called an “air purifier “ all that is is a machine that blows out a perfume to mask the smell it did not take out the musty moldy and cigarette smell ideallyI believe a dehumidifier would have worked a lot better. I also took a few photos of the mildew in the bathroom but will refrain from posting public. My love for Vegas hasn’t changed and I’ll be returning in a couple months but the Mirage won’t be on the top of my list. On a positive note they have a great casino floor with some of the best cocktail waitresses and the staff for breakfast at the Pantry is awesome a big shout out to Urbano and Koa their team work and excellent service went beyond the call of duty.
30,The check in lady was very rude and stated because I used Expedia I would get a crappy view and next time I should call hotel directly. There is no refrigerator to use because its filled with stuff they want you to buy.
40,Stayed three nights and found the room wonderful! I was with my mom and we upgraded to to the stay-well rooms. Was worth the little extra cost!! The rooms were quit and beds comfy. The location of this hotel is one of the best!
50,The entire staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are really nice and comfortable. The restaurants and shops are interesting and diverse with great staff. The Casino was fun and entertaining and the service was great.
40,Sorry stayed at Venetian 4 days prior and your rooms do not compare. Rooms too small. Bathroom small and cramped. TV size was small. I could here my neighbors intimidate conversation with her mom and her decision to leave her husband. Felt I did not have privacy if I could here every one in the halls.
50,My wife and I stayed at The Mirage for 6 days 5 nights for a great couples getaway. We had an absolutely super time across Vegas but this review will focus on the hotel. We loved the Mirage. Easy check in nice room with great views on the 23rd floor. We could see the pool area as well as down south of the Mirage on the strip (room 23038 was king room with views). We could even see the dolphins in their pool area from our room. We really enjoyed the casino area. Nice choice of slots but Game of Thrones was our favourite. They also had plenty of active tables games every day and night. We spent our afternoons at the pools but suggest you go by noon if you want to get two chairs together. Also we loved using Rhumbar (across from LVB burger) indoor section where you can refill your souvenir cup with your slushed drink of choice at a fair price(overpriced poolside). Located next to Caesar’s Palace on the strip so perfect location. Would most definitely stay again.
50,This is my 3rd ir 4th stay ay the Mirage. I like the central location on the strip access to good restaurants and everything else about it. The gaming folks are helpful bartenders generous and all are honest. Great resort.
50,We’ve recently returned from the best trip we’ve ever had!! We were absolutely blown away by this hotel and the hospitality of the staff.  We were given a complimentary upgrade to celebrate my husbands 30th birthday which gave us access to the Bare pool (the over 21 pool) which was great!  The room was fantastic spacious and had a great view of the volcano and the strip. The bed was the most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept in which really helped when you are jet lagged.  The casino is fab and really great size.  The location to the strip is fantastic. The choice to walk either left or right at the start of your day.  I genuinely don’t have any bad points about this hotel and can’t wait for our next visit.
10,I stayed at the villas at the mirage and it was awful. The worst experience I've ever had. So we get there and we were impressed at first. The hotel does a very good job at giving a good first impression. We were upgraded from s two to a three bedroom villa and hallway looked like it was from a palace. Everything went quickly downhill after that.  We got in and the outside was dirty leaves dirt and dead bees in the pool and jacuzzi. I call concierge and they explain that it will always be a little dirty and I understood that but I still wanted to be cleaned just that one time. Someone came in raked a few leaves off the golf putting green and left. Then the iPad that controls the entire room dies and when trying to plug it back in wont charge. So i call concierge it was 4am and the person who picked sounded very annoyed and tried explaining for 10 minutes how I should find the sweet spot and try and plug it in over and over again. Finally after the 7th time of asking if he can just come and fix it he agreed to come. I waited for a little over half an hour and no one came. Earlier that night we saw RATS in the outside area. We reported it and all they said was sorry. That is what I learned is their favorite word to use and they said it a lot instead of a tislly doing something.  The next night we try and go to a club. We try to go to 1oak as we were told since we were part of the villas we would get in. The security guard didnt let us in. We tried calling the villa concierge and butlers ( I'm sorry I forgot to mention there are butlers and concierge it really doesnt matter who we reached the response was always the other handled it and the second person we called knowing they couldnt pass it on just said fine) but none were available. After calling 10 times a person from the main mirage concierge picked up and said sorry I WILL WALK TO SEE WHERE THEY ARE AND HAVE THEM CALL YOU BACK!!!! Thank you to the main concierge for being better than the one I paid 6800 dollars for. So I get 2 missed calls from a telemarketing number. I say telemarketing because its one of those numbers that if you call back says the number you dialed is invalid or unavailable. So when I pick up the third time all I get is a sorry they should have let you in.  On top of that just some small things. The room service was meh. No salt or pepper provided. Outside was full of bees so pretty much couldnt go outside but I know it's not their fault. And flies inside the room. Enough for me to mention it. I will copy and paste this on as many places that let me. DO NOT GO HERE IT IS NOT WORTH IT. JUST GO TO THE SKYLOFTS YOU GET SO MUCH MORE FOR A THIRD OF THE PRICE. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
20,If your morning coffee is important you may want to skip the mirage. It’s not a vacation if you have to get dressed go downstairs walk a very far distance & then wait in a very long line just for my coffee. Ordering room service is a huge inconvenience too because of long wait times. Unacceptable to not have coffee in the room. I would expect this at cheaper properties. We also walked around for an hour looking for lounge chairs by the pool when we finally found a couple (needed 4) we had to superman into them because they are so tight. We will be passing on the Mirage in the future but LOVE show was amazing-I would see again.
50,Spent 2 comp nights at the Mirage. They gave me an upgrade option and it was fantastic. The suite was amazing! The resort is amazing with tons of stuff to do. The location is perfectly located on the strip.
40,I stayed in a beautiful 2 bedroom suite nice and clean all the time. House keeping was great. We got in late and wanted something to eat and they had this wonderful place open called the Pantry. Absolutely delicious THE PANCAKES yum No I mean yum lol
50,The facility was absolutely amazing. Very fast and convenient check-in. The pool is very nice and clean and has plenty of chairs. We got in line on the first day to make sure we got poolside chairs but soon found out that was not necessary. The rest of the days we were able to get there within the first hour it opened and got two chairs next to each other. If you have a larger group you may want to line up as folks do tend to get in line place towels on chairs and leave for awhile and you may miss out. The service and quality from the poolside bar was great.    We attended LOVE (The Beatles themed Cirq show within The Mirage) and thought it was absolutely breathtaking. Not to mention that we had back row seats and at the start of the show the usher offered many of us in the back much better seats and no charge to move up.    We did our drinking at Center Bar and The Still. Both had great service and the drinks were worth the money. At The Still you get a server for drinks and order your food from a walk up stand which was actually really nice because the servers only had to focus on keeping your drinks coming. We also ate at LVB inside The Mirage and the food was awesome. You can't go to Vegas without getting a buffet and Cravings is amazing. The food is spectacular and tap beer and wine is INCLUDED. (And soda/juice/coffee of course but its Vegas...DRINK!)    The room was clean and neat each day when we returned and we thought it seemed very adequate in size as well. Did not have the typical smokey Vegas stench so it felt new. The only downfall is you want a personal fridge you have to call housekeeping and request one. The one in the room is stocked full of mini-bar items and if you remove them you bought them as there are sensors that know when you remove items. We were unaware of this and we got charged for everything in the fridge when we emptied it to place our water in there. NOTE. The hotel was very great about understanding this and after taking inventory of the fridge at checkout returned those fees to our credit card. But to save yourself the hassle just tell them at check-in you want a fridge brought in.    When we got home we noticed a few issues with our invoice (the mini-bar items being one of them) and contacted The Mirage/MGM Resorts via email. They were very quick to have the bill sorted out refunded the incorrect charges and even gave us back the resort fee on a night for the hassle. The customer service we experienced was second to none and for that reason they will be our Las Vegas home 2 weeks of the year every year.
50,This is a beautiful hotel with great restaurants and a fun atmosphere. The rooms are clean and spacious. The atrium is amazing. Watching the volcano is a fun experience. I will definitely stay at this resort again. The pool was spacious and had a hot tub for our one chilly day.
20,Before this trip I would have given The Mirage 4 stars... but this trip was horrible. Did mobile check in estimated my time of arrival at 7pm. I arrived late 8:30pm surely my room would be ready. Nope was told someone was in cleaning it at that moment. We went and had dinner came back at 10:30pm two hours later. The room still was not ready we were told again that someone was in cleaning it that very moment. We were compensated a bit for this so it’s not my big complaint. My big complaint which may not bother everyone is the new housekeeping policy. This was my fifth time in a row staying at The Mirage clearly I like it (or liked it). I like to sleep in when I go to Vegas yet this trip after 2 days I had housekeeping knocking on my door every morning by 10am. Being woken up by this every morning was a great disturbance! I had just stayed there 6 months before and this did not happen. Apparently there’s a new policy that if you have the “Privacy Please” sign up for too long they have to harass you every day. No warning or mention of this new policy on check in (not surprised couldn’t check in since my room wasn’t ready) why offer the “Privacy Please” sign if you’re just going to ignore it? Anyway point is if you’ve travelled a fair distance and want to get some rest do not stay at The Mirage they will wake you up unnecessarily.
50,The Volcano room was available a little early and the view is Awesome!!! I have a perfect view of the Volcano and the strip. Service so far has been Excellent!!! The room is very clean and comfortable.! Room service brings you anything within 5 minutes of a phone call including my luggage. The staff have all been very nice helpful and courteous. As long as the rest of my stay is this enjoyable I will definitely be back and refer others to stay here as well!!!
50,Great location and good restaurant selection. Overall great entertainment options. Good gaming selections table and machines. Decent minimum bet ($10.00) levels on most table games. In my opinion Beatles Love best show in Vegas.
50,We travelled to Vegas with our 9 month old twin boys and we are so happy that we stayed at the Mirage. The trip was fabulous the only tiny issue was at check in when we went up to our room it smelled of cigarettes and the smoke alarm was beeping. However we called the front desk and they moved us immediately and re-keyed our card remotely so we didn’t have to go back to the front desk. Once we walked to our new room they sent up two mini cribs (excellent condition) with extra sheets as well as an extra fridge that I had requested. They will provide an extra fridge for medical reasons so you don’t have to disrupt the weight sensitive snack fridge. We went to the pool every day it was fabulous. There’s a shallow platform area perfect for babies and kids. The pool was super busy in the morning/early afternoon so we often went swimming from 4-6pm. I should add that we travelled during the week so we didn’t have to compete with weekend partiers or pool parties. We also checked out the secret garden; our boys loved the dolphins. The hotel has a few child-friendly restaurants. We tried the California pizza kitchen and they provided high chairs and room for our double stroller. Food was delicious. The Mirage is walking distance from many child friendly things including the Bellagio conservatory and fountains Caesar’s palace mall (Cheesecake Factory yum!) and the Flamingo wildlife habitat. Also there’s a Walgreens right across the street how convenient! We were super impressed with our stay and will definitely plan another family stay at the Mirage!
30,Great location however disappointed with Wi-Fi service. Having reliable internet is a must now a days. The gym was good pool is great the smoke not too bad in the casino. Not worth paying extra for the volcano view.
50,I will admit to having a HORRIBLE experience at check in and not gaining access to our room until an hour AFTER normal check in time. That said the front desk staff made up for it by removing resort fees and providing us a small credit for food/beverages during our extended wait. The two bedroom penthouse suite offered sweeping views of the mountains through floor to ceiling windows. The decor and furniture were lovely and the bar and dining room table were a real help for spreading out and having a few drinks and snacks on hand. The bathrooms were awesome! We especially loved the jetted tubs. Now the rest of the property is great too. We took full advantage of the pool gym and casino. We really appreciated that the location for ride share transportation was easily accessible as opposed to most other casino resorts. The volcano show was a hit with the kiddos too. All in great place! Would DEFINITELY stay here again!
30,I've been to Las Vegas many times and try out a different hotel each time. This time we chose the iconic Mirage. On the surface it is indeed a five star hotel. However our room was dated. Furniture was chipped and the bedding on occasion was a little yellow rather than white. The pool to look at was lovely but closer it was a bit like a zoo in terms of sun loungers and not really knowing who had vacated or not. It also seemed a little dirty. I know people are there to have fun but carrying cans or bottles of beer across the pool should not be allowed. The cost to get into the quieter space was between $300 and $400....EACH.... if you actually wanted a bed! Other than that the facilities are nice the casino is good staff are friendly.
30,My family of four stayed at the Mirage for one night as the kick-off to our family vacation. There was a long line at check-in (next time I will use their online check-in option...I didn't realize it would've saved so much time) but the line did go fairly quickly. We booked a One Bedroom Tower Suite because it said it slept 4. The room was stunning and huge with a giant jetted tub a king size bed bar great view of the strip etc. But I still can't figure out how this room sleeps 4...there is only one bed and the couch does not pull out or anything. We ended up spending $40 extra for a rollaway bed. Plus there is no coffee maker in the room (every other hotel we stayed in that week had one) and there seems to be a shortage of outlets (with two kids who brought clocks and fans and all of us with our phones and ipads we ran out of places to plug in). Beautiful room but not for a family.
50,Everything about the Mirage is beautiful but most of all we had a blast. There's so much to see and do. It's well organized and all the staff people are so polite and accommodating. We look forward to coming back here on our next trip.
20,"The car park was a good start and the location was good with regards to ""The Strip"". It goes down hill from there. Reception is like queuing for a Ryan Air or Easy Jet Baggage check in desk. Slow and crowded going in a zig zag line. The receptionist was friendly and along with the girl who served us in the poolside restaurant were the only members of staff we saw smiling. The room was adequate how ever the A/C was very noisy sounding like a train coming through the room. I had to turn it off and on a couple of times a night to quieten it down. I have in the 48 years of my adult life stayed in numerous hotels all over the world and this is the only one I have stayed in without Coffee and tea making facilities. They have a well stocked fridge with a notice saying you cannot use it for personnel use and if you touch anything it is immediately charged to your room. This includes the sweets/candies on top of the fridge withjin easy reach of children!!    The door access keyless system is very hard to work due I guess to the age we had to ask another guest if he knew what we were doing wrong a d he replied that he always had trouble opening his door as well. The wall appear paper thin as any conversation in the corridor can and in the early hours there were quite a few noisy drunken ones be clearly heard in the room.    Whilst I realise this is a Hotel/Casino a little bit less of unashamed money grabbing would go a long way to improve things."
50,We love staying here. Rooms are nice people who work there are very friendly. The hotel is not filled with smoke like many others. Love the whole atmosphere. Not as crowded. M Life members have nice perks and the restaurants at Mirage have excellent food. Is it a little pricey...yes but what in Vegas isn’t.
20,I usually stay at an MGM location when I go to Vegas. But this time I was given a rundown rooms with flies hovering around when we arrived. They said they ran out of rooms with double beds so we couldn't switch. The shower was old and leaky. The toilet sounded like the water was running the entire night. At least the bed was semi-comfortable.
50,I can not say enough about the Mirage. Attentive friendly staff clean rooms beautiful pool and hot tubs not to mention top notch restaurants. Center strip location is perfect! We had a great experience at the Mirage and wouldn't even think of staying anywhere else. We will definitely be back!
50,Very professional staff at hotel. Room was nice but the headboard was ripped which wasn't a great first impression on the room. Food was wonderful but it was expensive to me. In the middle of the strip so close to all the action. Overall I would stay there again!
50,This was my first trip to Vegas and we couldn't have chosen a better place to stay! The staff at this resort are fabulous! Great shows great restaurants great staff; what else could you ask for. Housekeeping did an excellent job. Our favorite was the little corner coffee shop where we spent every morning with Starbucks and a breakfast sandwich. Followed closely by the frozen yogurt shop diagonally across from it. Cirque de Soleil's Beatles Love was totally awesome.
50,The Mirage pool is amazing. Staff was excellent. Stack was a great place to eat. Loved that they had a Starbucks. Close to everything on the strip. Stayed in the penthouse. It was beautiful with a fabulous view.
30,Came to vegas for our honeymoonthe quality of the room was poor the headboard was ripped and was told all other rooms where booked.The hotel and casino it self was nicethe staff was nicebuffet was outstanding. My only issue is with the room
50,The people at the mirage have always treated me well. I look forward to seeing them again. Pool was great rooms was comfortable and clean and the dining was outstanding. I took a beating on the tables but that’s part of the trip I don’t visit your town to make money
10,Be very careful. The maids stole $1000 from our room and the hotel did nothing about it. Called us liars for making the accusation of theft. It was the first night we were there. Terrible service. Terrible communication.
30,This was my first and ONLY stay at the Mirage.  It took FIVE HOURS to get my luggage making it impossible to change for dinner!  SERVICE IN THE OULETS IS SLOW AND-DELIBERATE.  service in beer bar is non existent.
50,Stayed at Mirage which has great location. Next to Caesars and Treasure Island and across from Harrahs and Venetian. So can go to multiple hotels within short distance. Attended Beatles Love and Terry Fator Shows at Mirage. Both were great shows to see and can highly recommend. Ate at the buffet at Mirage and also Carnegie's Deli. Food was good and prices in comparison to other buffets and restaurants were reasonable Hotel Bell Staff Waitresses with drinks and Housekeeping were friendly. Can recommend this hotel due to all of the above. Used MyVegasSlots to get free show at Beatles Love and free buffet. Gambling was good and even came home with some money. Fun 3 day trip.
50,Here for a conference and i didn't notice until i was leaving Friday i had not stepped foot out of the resort. Morning was coffee noon lunch was provided at hotel and dinner was within the hotel. Seen a few shows while there.
40,I tagged along with my husband for his business conference at the Mirage. We used the electronic check-in and had no problems. Our room was nice with a big bathroom and comfortable bed. As other people have stated you have a decent walk through the casino area to the elevators but the signage is good pointing out the way. My only problem with having to walk through the casino wasn’t the distance but the smoke. The pool area is nice but very crowded with the lounge chairs right against each other. Would definitely stay again if in Vegas.
20,"The Mirage hosts a Bucket List item: ""Love"" the Cirque du Soleil show with music by the Beatles. That show one of the most amazing I've ever seen in 70 years of life saved The Mirage from a one-star review.    Bottom Line: The ground floor/casino smells like an ashtray.    Even workers at other hotels/shopping areas agreed The Mirage has a cigarette smoke odor problem. Other places didn't smell that bad.    Full disclosure: I'm a lung cancer survivor and am highly allergic to that reekness anyway. You can't get to the elevators to the rooms without running the gauntlet. Get to your room and your clothes smell.    And we don't gamble.    Yes the place is a bit dated to other properties...but come on. Buy decent smoke eaters.    On the other side the room was nice though there was a white-chalk powder on the bathroom walls which was weird. The view looked to The Strip but sitting in our 6th floor room we saw mostly mountains; which was cool. But we spent most of our time out of the hotel.    We ate once in the hotel. The food was over-priced but tasted okay.    We drank once in the hotel at a place called The Stil. It's supposed to be a Craft Beer bar but people there don't know anything about craft beer. I do. I got a bottle of Chimay (a Belgian) ($14) and they brought out an IPA glass. Now there's a reason brewers tell you what glass is best to use; better pour better nose better drink. This bar had one kind of beer glass. Now...for $14....    Loved 'Love'. Highly recommend it. But I can't recommend The Mirage. You might like it. My wife and I didn't."
30,I have stayed at the Mirage many times before but it had been a  while since the last stay. Our room needed some updating and we were so far from the elevator it was ridiculous. The slots were not good to us at all. Not even a little. We sat at a Black Jack table and were doing well but the dealer was rude so we ended up leaving it. We paid good money to sit in the Oasis area of the pool area. Service was great and the seats were comfortable but for what we paid there should have been more perks. All we got was one small slice of pineapple in a cup...lol. Not sure if I will stay here again.
50,Love staying at the Mirage. The size of the hotel & the location is perfect. Centrally located. Nice variety of restaurants all great. We have stayed at other hotels on the strip but the Mirage has the best pool!
20,I was attempting to use the app to change my reservations and it didn’t workout so well. I ended up “checking in” 2 days before I even arrived. When I got to hotel and explained my situation the clerk said “My manager said too bad you agreed to the terms”. I thought this was the worst I’ve ever been treated at a hotel. So I had to pay for 2 days I wasn’t even there.
20,We were sent to a dirty room then sent to a room that had new view of the strip which we had originally had. The front desk attendant from San Francisco who assigned us this room did not care about our issue. The manager was nice and then gave us a third room with a view of the strip. Check in took nearly two hours!
50,This was a wonderful first stay at Mirage. Rooms were clean and comfortable. The buffet was decent priced along with Beatles Love show. Pool was clean and relaxing with a wonderful wait staff. I would definitely stay here again.
50,Just stayed at the Mirage for four days. Experience was absolutely great. Staff at check in were very helpful and polite as was the room delivery folks and house keeping. Room was nice but it was the people that made the difference this time. I have stayed at the Mirage at least four or five times and this was the best so far.
20,Everything in the hotel was fine except when it came to sleeping! My husband and I spent one night and the entire night our door rattled every time someone else opened their door! so we were awaken all night with the door rattling!! We even turned on white noise on our phone to try to mask the noise but alas the door was too loud. Left super tired and couldn't wait to sleep in our own bed.
50,"The ""Tower"" was very convenient to access with only two floors on our elevator ride. Floor 24 & 25. This was perfect and quick to get to our room. The room was really nice and clean. I would recommend this hotel to friends and family."
50,Always a great place to stay clean comfortable rooms. My 15th time staying in the Mirage - I'll be back. Buffet is delicious. Don't miss Beatles Love Cirque Du Soleil Sigfried and Roy's Secrete Garden and Dolphins. Happy fun casino. Good strip location.
40,Very few of the Vegas hotel pools are open in March but the Mirage pool is open and it was great! Beautiful setting and water temp was warm enough to enjoy.    The only thing I would like to see the hotel get on top of is all the “ghosted” lounge chairs. People will either put out a towel to save chairs and not come back for hours if at all or they just leave the towels on the chair when they leave and no one knows if there is someone using the chair. Most resorts will have staff that stay on top of abandoned towels and remove them but Mirage does not do this. An alternative would be handing out a towel when the guests enter the pool area (they check room IDs at the entrance anyway) and then have the guests return their used towel on exiting. Very simple and would make for much happier pool guests!
50,"This was quick 1day trip to see ""LOVE""! Service was great the hotel is huge so wear your tennys! Very friendly knowledgeable staff. If you're a Veteran he sure to sign up for M Life! Perks are great!"
20,I had reserved a king room with volcano view on the mlife website. when we arrived at the Mirage we were told they had no king rooms left and gave us a 2 queen room with a view of the pool. The room was okay but very noisy and we could here the elevator ding every time it stopped on our floor. Also trying to get a drink in the casino is almost impossible and at least 2 of the servers were very rude... On a good note the Mirage is in an excellent location.
40,Bathroom was in need of attention. Leaking tub... cracks. I usually stay at ceasers & this was just ok in comparison. I liked the pool secret garden & I was with a teenager so I liked it for the fact that it’s more child friendly. I hated the Beatles show. I’ve seen almost ALL and never felt that way about a cirqu until now. Room serviced messed up but did the right thing & comped my bill. Food choices were ok. Buffet ok. I feel asleep on a bench waiting to go to the airport and security care over & told Me I need to stay awake! If I wasn’t so out of it & tired I would have given him a piece of my mind! Not nice.
40,A really fun hotel. The pool area is amazing as well as the casino. Room service is delicious with average pricing. Disappointed the room did not include an empty fridge for our use without paying an extra fee just a stocked fridge where we had to pay for each individual item. Pretty annoying. Also the pillows were very uncomfortable. Staff was incredible! Especially the housekeeping and concierge! Would stay here again for sure.
30,Waited almost 4 hours for our room to be cleaned---told them to comp the resort fee or I was leaving. $24.00 to valet park per day. Mini Bar in room--not going to use. Charged my friend's account $15.00 for a bag of M&M's we never touched. Showed the clerk at the check out desk the picture of the mini bar and what was on top when we left the room so if someone was in there after us they took the M&M's---she took those off. Every restaurant in that place is $20.00 for one meal/one person. Nickel poker is $5.00 minimum bet...what is the point ???? No coffee maker in room--what is the resort fee for???? Never staying on Strip again. Had to go ask about checking in to our room 3 different times and was told 3 different things. Never waited 4 hours at any Hotel to check in. Said I would receive a text. Been home for 5 days and still NO TEXT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10,They have a great scam going where they don't refill the in room refreshments until after you have arrived and then charge you for what was missing. I was charged a total of $23.00 for things I never touched.    This place is no different than anywhere on the strip (a place to part fools and their money) with nothing that stands out as unique. The food was way over-priced for the quality received. I would never have stayed here had I not attended a conference. I had my fill of secondary smoke.
50,"Friendly faces throughout the casino. They were very attentive to anything we needed or had questions about. All the employees were polite and friendly. That made us feel very welcome.  We ate at four of the restaurants at the Mirage all were excellent! Good food great service. Since it was Las Vegas of course the prices were a little high but the food was worth the value.  The room was comfortable and clean. No problems with noise. Since I'd already seen the ""Love"" show I didn't see it this trip but the show is fantastic!!  Beverage service in the casino was great. We weren't playing in the high rollers section but we had drinks delivered to us without having to flag anyone down.  The Bliz frozen yogurt shop was a great place to get a snack and cool down after walking out on the Strip.  The greenery at the entrance to the Mirage was very nice as well as the aquarium behind the front desk. A pleasant welcome.    We were able to checkout via the television so that got us out of the hotel quickly and saved us some time.    I can highly recommend the Mirage."
50,We drove in from SouthernnCalifornia as we had a wedding in North Las Vegas and we pretty much stay at Mirage all the time. We were pleasantly surprised with our stay. We visited the pool the casino the sportsbook and had breakfast
20,The room and bathroom were dirty. I reported it and it was not fixed while onsite. The outlets had very nice people working in them. The steak restaurant and Italian restaurant were great! Carvings the buffet was ok but not great.
50,I visited The Mirage for a 10 day holiday to celebrate my husbands birthday. Karrie from Guest services and David at check in made sure that my husband had a very memorable birthday. On arrival my husband was greeted with Birthday greetings a Birthday card and a room upgrade.    The room was large clean and had a great view.    The hotel has an excellent location on the strip. The staff are very attentive and professional.    Great pool for chilling out in and always staff on hand for drinks & food at the pool.    We tried a lot of the bars and restaurants in the hotel and each one was great.    Thank you The Mirage team for making my husbands birthday such a memorable one. We will be back soon 👍
50,All the people we had contact with were very helpful and always kind.I hope to return soon.The food was great .Remember to get to the pool early . It fills up quick and you don't want to miss the waterfall
40,Excellent rooms casino and pool. Very fast check in process. Valet was very prompt. Need better soap in bathroom and in-room coffee maker. Very convenient to the strip activities. Would stay here again.
40,The Mirage is a well-known casinobrand on the Strip of Las Vegas.  I always visit the pokerroom when Im in town but Ive never stayed in the hotel.  This year I wanted to surprise my GF with this hotel.  I checked-in early and it wasnt a problem. The friendly girl behind the desk offered me a two-beds-room immediately or a room with king-size bed with a little waiting-time.  I choose the latter and around 12 I received an e-mail with a nice message that my room was ready.  I already had the keys in my posession it was very conveniant.    My room was at the far end of the North-wing of the 19th floor.  When I entered the room I was pleasantly surprised with a double view.  Because it was a corner-room I had windows at two walls. Great!    The bed was very comfy clean and well-sized. A fully stocked mini-bar a nice desk to sit at and a perfect wide-screen television.  The badroom was dated but perfect. A shower with enough pressure and a wash-table. Every thing you need is available.  Overall clean and comfortable.    You dont need to leave this hotel.  The swimmingpool is large and safe.  Free water and towels other services for a fee.    One point of annoyment: Dont accept the ‘reservation’ of the beds by towels.  It looks cheap and it cannot be accepted.  Do something about it!    Would I recommend? YES!
50,Awesome stay here ! The staff all around was amazing ! Cleaning people were so nice and always said goodmorning or good afternoon with smiles in their faces.  At the cafe we had a lovely lady who serviced us i wish i knew her name but she was so sweet!  The whole staff was friendly and at any time when i had for anything they were always soooooo sweet and awesome ! Thank you mirage for having an amazing staff and for the wonderful vacation ! I will return !
20,Planned a little staycation at the mirage hubby and I were attending the wine spectator grand tour event that is hosted at the mirage.  I liked the convenience of online check in 24 hours prior and mobile check in. No lines room was ready an hour before check in.  Of course the pricing for Saturday night is outrageous. We booked a 2 queen strip view room. The way mirage is located your strip view is kinda off. We could see Caesar’s palace and Eiffel tower but doesn’t justify a true strip view.  Room was just meh small bathroom and not so great shower. I dunno if it’s a strip thing but you have a mini bar and highly overpriced snacks but not a coffee maker in the room. Either you order the super expensive room service that charges $4 per item fee or walk down to the Starbucks that is so busy coz that’s the only place for take out coffee.  Pool is nice but very crowded and no shade unless you pay extra for the private section that has umbrellas.  What got me the most is $37 resort fee and a $4 tax on the resort fee say what??? That’s on top of the $26 room tax. The resort fee does not include parking which is $15 per night. It includes a very choppy wifi.  The cheese pizza we ordered from room service was excellent hot and fresh as if taken right out of the oven and brought to us.  I didn’t think it was worth $350 for one night maybe it’s more bang for the buck on weekdays where room prices are lot better.
30,Mirage is a very nice place to stay and the rating would be 5 stars if not for housekeeping not properly cleaning the room. Room needs updating. Not deluxe as advertised. The Casino staff restaurants are fantastic. Pool is over crowded. Secret Garden is not worth its cost unless you like dolphins. Food is overpriced. Mirage is centrally located with stores nearby to overcome the expensive nature inside the Mirage. Believe it or not I would go back but not if I want to use the pool
40,We visited for 5 nights and ended up eating breakfast at the Mirage buffet 3 mornings out of our stay. Staff were awesome (shout out to awesome server diane!) bartender was quick and food options were fresh and of good quality.    We will be back!
30,When we arrived the room was not as promised... They did switch up the next day.. much better room but what a pain to do plus took time out of our day....this hotel was just ok. Wasn’t very updated pool was very crowded. We don’t care for smoking and it just was over powering. they did end up taking care of us with the room ...
50,Staying at the Mirage is always a delight. We greatly enjoy the casino environment it has all the slots that we like to play. Good selection of restaurants with good food and lots of great places to eat nearby. Our room was clean with a nice bed no problems at all. Fast check-in with mobile check-in is a plus.
50,Had an outstanding birthday weekend at The Mirage this week. From check-in Thursday afternoon to check-out this morning I could not be more pleased we chose this property for our trip. The staff all of them we encountered were friendly and professional the room great restaurants superior entertainment options great (saw LOVE and hight recommend this show!) and gambling was find..... didn't lose ALL our gambling funds. Really have no complaints. For example when we got to our room after check-in we discovered two issues. The plug in the bathroom sink was stuck closed and the wall safe had an error code and couldn't be used. Called the front desk and shortly had staff from two different departments come to resolve the issues in less than a half hour. Have had room issues at other properties over the years and in our experience it's always taken MUCH longer to get things corrected. Than you Mirage for a great Vegas visit!
30,the hotel is a good location however it is older and doesn't have the best options for eating. the check in staff are not organized we had to check in twice and switch rooms in the middle of our trip. the dealers are friendly. the Mlife staff and rude and impatient and do not assist or explain in receiving points
50,"I loved staying at the Mirage. I appreciate that it's slightly smaller but has everything you need while in Vegas. The shows are amazing and the pool is so relaxing. It's located in the ""hub"" of the strip getting around is easy. We're already planning our next trip!"
40,Nice hotel lacks some basics for a total service atmosphere. Coffee makers in rooms would eliminate long lines and some stress. Guest services desk is essential. Shower heads are low for us six footers.
50,"If you are looking for a great hotel without a great big price tag this is the place to be. The decor in the the entry and lobby are breathtaking.    The accommodations are very comfortable and the ambiance of the casino and restaurant areas are equally as pleasing. Staff is courteous and knowledgeable.    All I can say is ""If this is a Mirage who needs reality!!!!"" Treat yourself  to a delightful experience at the Mirage in Vegas. You will come back feeling like a winner!!!"
40,Everything that you would expect for 50$ a night. Nothing extra nothing less. If needing to stay within a budget this is a good hotel to book at. If you are looking for a more extravagant stay you might need to look elsewhere.
40,I have been to the Mirage a few times each for business. It is a short walk from the Sands Expo which is why I've gone there. This stay was generally good except that I did the online check-in the morning of my arrival and they didn't have a hotel room for me when I arrived. They eventually gave me a hotel room for 1 night and told me I'd have to switch rooms after the first night for the remaining nights. That's just very poor service. After a few hours they were able to keep me in my original room for all 3 nights.    On the positive side the room service food is quite good and the fitness center is very well equipped.    I'm never a fan of walking through the smoky casino just to get to the guest room elevators but that's Vegas.
10,I was excited about staying at the mirage until I did. The room was awful! So much so that I didn’t stay the doors are flimsy and you can hear everything that happens everywhere out of the room. There was so much noise from other rooms you cannot use the fridge and if you touch anything they automatically charge you! The room smelled it was rather small the carpet was dirty. Nothing special about the rooms and in all honesty motel 6 remodeled facilities are better. Stay somewhere else really not worth it if you are looking for quality.  There was also some funky characters staying right across the hall one opened his door butt naked as I was leaving the place.
50,Great value for money. Rooms are very large and location can't be beat. The Beatles was a very good show. I didn't eat at the buffet this time but it is always very good and comes with beer or wine.
40,The hotel is centrally located on the strip broad range of amenities. The Stay Well rooms are really nice and extra sense of calming and relaxation. The range of food options is very good and you can walk across the street to several other casinos.
50,Our visit to the Mirage was also our first visit to this hotel. We had previously booked a King room but upon arrival they had informed us that there was an overbooking problem and therefore upgraded us to one of the penthouse suites. Safe to say we were not unhappy by their decision. The suite was huge with it's own bar living area dining area bedroom spa bath make up area separate toilet and dressing room. The hotel's service was fantastic with helpful reception staff and good housekeepers. Room service was also quick.  The location is great right near the centre of the strip and it's not too far of a walk from the hotel to the strip itself.    The casino is nice with plenty of choices for games. The poker room was fantastic and the restaurants and buffets were also above average.    Would definitely stay here again.
30,Checking in and checking out was very easy. The staff was excellent especially housekeeping. The restaurants that we ate at were very good. The room was clean. The only problem is we had were the air conditioning was very poor. And the lighting in the bathroom to put your make up on was extremely poor. For those reasons I will not be coming back
30,Went down for the nhl playoffs hotel was great except for the room. Wifi did not work in the room and there was black mould in the washroom and a broken fire sprinkler hanging out of the wall tryed to talk to the front desk was told the hotel was full come back later. Later showed them pictures and all they offered was to wave my resort fee and take the room out of service after I checked out not to impressed
40,We had planed a road trip from Lethbridge Alberta with my sister 3 yrs ago for her retierment but a family death{her husband} canceled that .So this year we did it as my sister had not been there for 18 yrs...She said oh my so much channge and so much to see..We went on the big wheel and a beatles show...It was wonderful...She was so happy that made my husband and I pleased as well.We had a great time
50,Check-in was a little slow but everything else was perfect and clean.  We saw the Beatles show and the buffet there was the best I have seen anywhere!  Place was clean environment was great. Lobby was a little crowded due to people waiting to check in.
30,We have stayed at the Mirage quite a few times as we travel to Vegas 4 times a year. The Mirage is hit and miss.    The staff are unfailingly polite and helpful. The location is ideal. The overall hotel upkeep is excellent. The Italian restaurant is excellent as is Tom C’s place. Good bars.    The mobile check option seemingly does nothing. They may - may not have the room you booked. Usually the rooms are decent but there is almost *something* not working. (This trip the shower drain was blocked and there was zero wi-if on our floor. (Connected fine elsewhere.) We called and stopped by the front desk. No result.) If you want a pool seat you best reserve one. (rates vary $35-$60?)    As platinum MLIFE members we expect better. It’s time for us to move on to another hotel.
40,Well placed for seeing and experiencing the sights of Vegas.  Like all the hotels it is large and impersonal but he staff here were very attentive and polite. The rooms are good sized and clean. We ate breakfast here and although pricey was very good. There are so many places to eat out nearby. The best buffet we had was at The Wynn.  The Mob Museum is well worth a visit  An amazing place to experience but not too often.
20,The grounds are beautiful from the outside in. However most dealers we encountered seemed smug and rude. No personalities at all out or the 12-15 I met I'd say I actually enjoyed 3 off them. Raj didnt even say a single word for an hour and just ignored my questions.
40,We stayed 4 nights in a resort king. The room was just a standard room nothing flashy. Furniture and cabinets were pretty out dated and scratched up. House keeping was great had the room cleaned everyday by 10-11. If you plan on going to the pool the line starts at 0800 for the 0900 opening. Lounge chairs are gone by 9:30. Everything is pricey. Parking is $15 a day. Would stay again.
50,The staff are very cheerful and approachable. Nearby staff was very happy and joyful for me when I cheered for my win on slots of a thousand dollars. The rooms were very throughly cleaned each day. MLife desk clerks were very patient and explained everything very well.
50,Friendly staff beautiful inside very clean spacious lots of activities fairly priced right on the strip. The atrium is so bright and the volcano show is exceptional. I would recommend The Mirage to anyone wanting to visit Las Vegas.
30,Maybe I'm being a bit harsh giving this once fine hotel only 3 out of 5 but since it was taken over ny MGM it isn't what I expected.  I stayed at the hotel in 2001 and although not classy it was stylish with a more elegant feel to it.  The main bar was a quiet place to escape the casino floor. This has now gone and many electric slots of vibrant colours flashing and sounding off all day and night have been installed.    Pros.  The staff are all friendly and happy to help.  The food that I had was tasty and although not cheapvery good.  It is ideally placed near bars and entertainment of the South Strip.    Cons  The sunbeds by the pool are quickly and early taken up and reserved with towels. Many empty beds as people reserved them for later. I heard several people complaining about this at 10.30 am. I asked the guy at the gate what the policy was and he said the life guards would remove towels where the beds had not been in use in over an hour. I wondered how they patrolled this task.  No kettles in the rooms but I believe most hotels in Vegas don't have them. On this trip I was in Fort Worth Dallas and Memphis where all had this facility.  Our flight home was at 9.30 pm and we had to be out of the room at noon (up from the stated 11 am check out time. Unfortunately they don't have a room to change or shower in.  Smoking is allowed on the casino floor and at the bar. People walking around with lighted cigarettes set the tone of how downmarket the hotel has become.    I'm sure MGM are making more profit by turning it into a mass money making environment but I certainly won't be staying there again.
40,This is our third visit to this hotel. Check in and staff very efficient and friendly. Daily maid service was excellent. Plenty of slots to play but like other casinos they are tight.  My main complaint is with the resort fees.
40,The hotel is a little on the older side but it was very clean you could see and smell it. I loved the mobile check in (saved alot of time) and prints your cards and sends your room number within 5 minutes. The room was average but clean only issue with the room was it wasnt ever cold enough (it's hot in Vegas). From what I remember seeing the buffet was not advertised idk where it was. I did eat at the LV Burger and it was exceptional service was great a little pricey but what isn't in Vegas? The pool was nice a little chilly still but the hot tub was perfect the jets (when they started working) were great the maintenance man fixed the issue immediately after being made aware. Definitely will be going back!
50,We stayed at the Mirage for a 4 night vacation. The lobby grounds and pool area are all beautiful. Many restaurants and a lovely coffe shop. Best of all one of the prime tourist draws is at the Mirage - the volcano. And the Terry Fator show is fabulous. Hope to be back!
50,We love this place I wish our stay was longer but is was fun my daughter love the volcano show the buffet my wife love the shows too I hope our next visit we can get the suit room. The Mirage you guys are amazing
50,I've been a long time Vegas visitor and during my last visit I stayed for the first time at the Mirage and I'm very glad I did. I was impressed. My room was very clean quiet with a partial view of the strip and pool. The staff at the hotel are very friendly and professional. The casino has a great selection of slots and table games. I'd definitely stay at the Mirage again.
50,When I arrived I must admit I was a bit disappointed my immediate feeling was that this was a large tiered tourist class hotel and doesn't have the immediate impact of say the Bellagio or Wynn however my feeling of underwhelming disappeared as soon as I was greeted by reception staff. Their great service and professionalism was consistent across the hotel. There are great facilities although the pool area was really busy and I couldn't believe that there was a queue to get in before breakfast reminiscent of a budget Spanish hotel. My room was outstanding in every way and I have posted pics and a video. Service in the casino is also very good with complementary drinks with the service staff really proactive. I really do recommend this hotel but it is busy and at meal times it's difficult to get in places and room service don't even answer but it is really great. I've found the service availability at other even more expensive hotels in Vegas so I can't really complain - I'd just recommend eating outside since there are loads of options - especially in the local mall or opposite In The venitian.
10,This hotel did not meet my standards stratosphere is a better hotel my room smelled horrible I didn’t win in the casino my clothes smelled like my room it was the worse birthday trip ever rude staff will never be back
20,My room was very outdated. The ventilator above the commode was continuously leaking (hopefully it was just water) on the toilet seat and on us when using the toilet. In the mornings a puddle of water was on the floor from the leak. Also the shower rod is poorly attached making the curtain slip open while showering. The shower head provides an overly strong flow that is uncomfortable. Most of the towels are in bad shape. Pool-side service was poor.....very few ladies attending guests. One of my pillows actually smelled of vomit. I can stay in a much nicer room for the same price elsewhere. The only good thing about your hotel on this trip was the location.
50,We were very happy here and would recommend to anyone! Very tropical and laid back. First rate. Everything is clean and the bellhops and front desk are helpful. We did not have to wait in long lines either. Check in on the MGM App!
50,Great hotel. I was so nervous as a Vegas virgin but this was a perfect place to stay. Not too big beautiful friendly and clean. Flawless from start to finish. Easy to get around close to everything (not that you even need to leave) I felt so at home. I cannot wait to go back!
30,The bathroom wasn’t in the greatest shape with a couple of notable deficiencies with the shower head and a leaky faucet. The rooms could use a coffee machine a microwave and some space in the fridge for the storage of some leftovers.
50,The Mirage is a great experience. It offers the total package. With the hotel personnel always there to assist you and positive to your requests. The room and room decor just right. The dining facillities offered a unique variety to suit your pallet. The gaming tables were well played. I will be back to enjoy the Mirage.
20,Stayed here before notice the decline in the room cleanliness and friendliness of staff. Room venting system smelled moldy. THE buffet was great. Not very friendly pitbosses not helpful with explaining the comp system
50,Easy check-in check-out. Excellent location - midway on the Strip. Spacious well appointed room overlooking the Strip pool and mountains. Comfortable beds. Elevators for specific floors - no waiting. Cleanliness second to none. Gorgeously decorated and maintained restrooms throughout the facility. A variety of restaurants and entertainment - something for everyone. Wait staff efficient attentive and friendly. Great shopping. Lovely spa. Roomy well laid-out casino. Large beautiful pool area.  But the crowning touch is the professional courteous knowledgeable staff. If you pass a staff member in the hall he/she would intentionally make eye contact and comment hi how ya doin' or have a good day. They literally anticipated your needs. Calls to front desk answered on first ring by helpful staff. Resourceful concierge. Whoever hires and trains the staff is to be commended. They are choosing the right people. A most enjoyable stay all around. I WILL be back!    Fridge in the room is a necessity but couldn't be used unless paid for. This is the ONLY downside of this fabulous hotel
50,The rooms were very clean always hot water and your in the heart of the strip Beatles show was amazing. Staff were lovely had great time hopefully we will return .Carnegie deli sandwiches are massive and cheesecake to die for x
50,I would highly suggest to friends and family to stay at the Mirage . Staff very friendly room was very clean  great places to eat and very fun atmosphere! Casino was clean and very busy . I just had a Wonderful Time !!
20,"They created charges and then treated me rude as if I was lying. I contacted the front counter and had a female who told me I made the charges to my room from the pool area. I explained I didn't have a room at the hotel until 5pm. She then stated ""Well you will have to just dispute your charge"" I then went to the front counter and spoke with a David who was very respectful and attentive and agreed that If I didn't have a room I certainly could not have charged anything to it. He eventually had the items removed."
40,We enjoy the Mirage because it is centrally located to everything we want on the strip and the facility is clean and inviting. We find the staff is very nice and accommodating. This time was no exception plus it was the first time we used Uber and it was easy to use from the hotel.
40,Pros: Great location hotel is family friendly (not that many hotels in Las Vegas are family friendly) great pools dolphin and secret garden experience (extra charge). 24/7 restaurant was great.  Cons: Long time on check in and check out. The main reason of this according to their staff is that the printer is extremely slow as the card system.
50,Good room and staff was very friendly and helpful with any question we had. Late night food was on point and pizza even with limited topping options was really good I would definitely stay at this location again
10,One of the worst experiences I have ever encountered and most of the staff were so nonchalant and didn’t seem like they cared and wanted to just go home. The guy literally told me that’s just how it is and walked off. Are u serious. I would expect so much more from a casino and resort of its caliber.
30,I stayed here in December 2018 (to be close to friends staying at the Venetian) and most recently in April 2019 (friend's comped room). It's an ok hotel: rooms are spacious and clean and the grounds are nice but I wasn’t blown away. Back in December I paid the extra money for a “Stay Well” room but they completely ran out of the remotes that control the mood lighting. The hot tub jets were non-functional on my last visit. One hot tub was just gross with lukewarm stagnant water (zero jets on) and the other hot tub only had 2 working jets. I’m not one to complain on a comped room but I would’ve been very annoyed if I paid full price. It's unacceptable for an MGM resort. Overall the hotel’s not too shabby but I’d only stay here again if I needed a cheap room around this specific part of the strip.
10,"As a M-Life member I received an email that asked if i wanted to check-in online. I went through a 8 - 10 page process and came to the last page with ""You are checked-in. You will receive an email when your room is ready. When I arrived at the hotel I still didn't get that email. So I had to go the front desk. The front desk person said I wasn't checked-in. And made me go thru the process again. Doing it online was supposed to take care of that - a real waste of time . . . . . ."
20,Just checked in ahead of our wedding tiny bathroom with terrible soundproofing not enough storage and worst of all a terrible mattress that you sink into. Literally no support. Room at Treasure Island last year was superior in every way (bathroom bed view layout) and much cheaper. We’re not even a particularly picky couple. Really laid back usually but this truly is disappointing.
20,Are usually don’t leave reviews on things but my experience with this so poor that I thought I must.    When we first arrived our room that we had paid for have been given away. This happened with the three other couples that we were also with. We didn’t receive the rooms with the views room we paid for and we also did not get a king size bed we were all given the rooms with two queen’s. When we first arrived our room that we had paid for had been given away. This happened with the three other couples that we were also with. We didn’t receive the rooms with the views we paid for and we also did not get a king size bed we were all given rooms with two queen’s.    They upgraded our friends to the “stay well” room but the lady who checked us in would not. So we ended up in a basic room and told we would have to switch the next day. Our room was so dirty. Hair in the shower no pillow cases on the pillows dirty sheets sink that clearly hadn’t been cleaned etc.    Today to switched us to the stay well room and it is very nice. But even getting that done today was a big hassle. We have spent 2 hours of our trip dealing with this. We won’t be coming back next time we are in Vegas!
30,After looking around at the other resorts on the strip in the same price range I would suggest shopping around.    Stayed 4 nights in a Resort Tower King room. Everyone keeps saying it's an upgraded room but the decor is seriously dated. No outlets by the bed for charging your phone. Big gaps around the door frame allow noise from the hallway. Stay on the 24th floor and get a view of a parking structure.    The casino floor is poorly ventilated and the smell of smoke gets overwhelming really quickly.    Paid for early check-in at 11. Arrived early and was given room keys with a promise that someone would contact me with the room number at 11 or before when the room was ready. 11 came and went and no one ever contacted me. I had to stand in line again to get the room number.    The housekeeping staff were very helpful and efficient. Don't forget to tip your housekeepers.    The location is convenient to other attractions on the strip.
50,"Awesome well priced experience right in the middle of the Strip! It's not a ""Mega resort"" but just the right size! The dolphin tour is awesome! The restaurants are great. Be warned if you have kids you have o walk through the casino to get to the elevators"
30,It's just old feels old and outdated. For the price you can get more for your money elsewhere. The pool though is still the best and still my favorite. There wasn't anything necessarily bad it was just a lot of little things that added up. Great location! If you can get a great deal it'd be worth it but don't expect any sort of luxury.
40,My husband and I really enjoyed out stay. It was my first time in Vegas. The mirage has a fantastic location on the strip! We walked almost everywhere. The room was well kept and spacious.  The pool/ hot tubs were fantastic! Great atmosphere!    Only cons were the water pressure in the shower was too strong and there were no outlets available by the bed to plug in your phone for the night to have it at arms reach. We were in a standard room. Minor complaints at best! I highly recommend this property.
40,Lumpy mattress housekeeping skipped us one night need to remove resort fees for people who don’t use those amenities. It’s been at least 6 months that the water around the volcano has worked. We really enjoy gambling there and we seen Beatles Love this time and it was wonderful!!! Otherwise we love the Mirage!!
40,I love the Mirage purely for the tropical décor. Everything from the fountains pools tropical plants outside to the beautiful indoor atrium reminding me of a tropical paradise! Our room was gorgeous and the pool is even better. I loved the fact that the hotel isn't too large so walking everywhere is convenient. I would definitely stay again as I prefer Mlife hotels.
30,"Pros:  -room was nice plenty of hot water pool was great for kids service folk were nice  - volcano: go down street level to hear the music and feel the flames. Kids really enjoyed it  - LOVE Cirque show is here. Loved it nice that it was in our same hotel    Con:  -doors DO NOT keep out or in any noise. You could stand outside a room and hear every word. So for this ""family friendly"" hotel that means plenty of folks keeping us awake past our nine year-olds' bedtimes talking shouting running etc. down the halls. Wife and I didn't get much sleep at all first night. She was clever enough to download free white noise app on our 4 devices pads and phones and create a pretty good noise barrier.    - paid $$ more a day for ""volcano view"". Don't bother. Our room on 15th floor had view blocked by 1 floor's atrium dome. And it's surrounded by flood lights you'd have to peer past anyway. This after I both confirmed via phone day before and at check-in that our room would have a view of the volcano. After all kids were looking forward to it. Anyway tho they said they'd text me when a new room was ready they didn't That meant I had to go thru it all over again and that was mid-afternoon a terribly crowded time. So after that 2nd effort we moved ourselves down the hall. Mirage took off 1st day's resort fee but only after I requested some compensation. Bottom line: give the right room the first time and follow thru on your promise THE FIRST TIME when room is inadequate    - Checked our bill night before early am departure. Had to explain a Starbucks charge was bogus (it was) and read them the receipt of our LVBurger dinner as someone there listed it as about $50 more than the total. The desk person was quite nice (wonder if she encountered this before from her response) and took off both charges no prob even went some beyond. But I must say unless our experience was unusual watch out for false charges.    So problems were handled just encountered more than our share for a 4 night visit.    BTW this is one of the larger casinos so staying here does mean a good deal of back-and-worth walking and crowd management. Just saying."
50,This place was amazing! The staff was great the hotel was great and the buffet was amazing. We found ourselves looking for Bhing our dealer multiple times throughout our stay because she was just such a pleasure to lose our money to. Lol!!
40,"During my most recent trip to Vegas I requested an upgrade to one of the new Stay Well rooms. These rooms are the absolute BEST! The bed alone is so comfortable I found myself wishing I could just stay there! That along with all the other ""perks"" of the room make it just what a weary business traveler needs to wake refreshed and ready to conquer all of my scheduled meetings!"
20,resort fees parking and taxes is over $80.00 a nite  $473.60 room for 3 nights  $219.22 resort fees parking and tax  Bathroom remodel felt cheap (fixtures all loose and tub moved like cheap plastic insert)
40,The Mirage smells amazing friendly staff clean hotel. Food at California Pizza and The Pantry is amazing. Pool is beautiful with all the trees. Rooms are clean and bed is very comfortable. The location is awesome!
50,The Mirage was a perfect hotel. First time we stayed here and we will come back. Location is center of the strip and it’s a perfect location. Hands down better than the Linq that we stayed at last time.
50,Great stay at the Mirage! We are still uncertain what the MLife Rewards go towards. The front desk took care of a small issue without any questions as we checked in late and were tired. So they said go ahead get rested in the current room and we will take care of you tomorrow and they did just that!
40,I had a wonderful time at the Mirage. They have plenty of restaurants and the food is very good. The rooms are nicely decorated and have all the amenities I needed for my stay. The staff is very friendly.
10,"We booked a night as a treat at the end of a big camping holiday/road trip. It was the opposite. The main casino air stinks of farts - a result of the gross water features mixed with cigarette and cigar smoke and air con. It's swarming with people. We rushed to get there for an afternoon at the pool only to be told it had a ""biohazard"" in it and was closed for an hour. The row upon row of sweaty beige plastic sun loungers were all taken and bad music was throbbing. You couldn't get a nice cocktail just big plastic souvenir cup frozen daquiri mix stuff. All of this I could have handled but our room was truly awful. So dirty there was a thick layer of dust and grime on everything. The bed heads had bodily fluid smears across them and there was a pube in the bath. The mirrors were covered in spatter marks the tap was coming away from the wall there were smeary finger marks on the stationery. Everything was shabby. It was the shabbiest hotel room I've possibly ever stayed in and I travel a lot. We complained and were told there was no room to move us to and that they would clean it again whilst giving us a $50 food voucher so we could vacate the room. The restaurant refused to acknowledge the food voucher and then the front desk basically told us that was tough and they couldn't just refund us the $50 even though we had already paid for the meal. The room was only very slightly cleaner after they serviced it. All in all disappointing and gross. Went to the Wynn the next day for brunch and it was significantly nicer... The front desk really didn't care with the amount of people staying in the hotel my complaint was just a drop in the ocean."
40,Best pool in Vegas! Really enjoy the rock plant life and water features throughout the property. Nightly volcano show is incredible. Food and drinks are outrageous expensive! In all fairness I think all places on the strip are like that. Very difficult to get a cup of coffee in the morning. They don't even put a coffee maker in the rooms anymore!!
20,"I arrived at mirage and was told my room would not be ready for 3-4 hours after normal check in time. When I debated this I was told I am not guaranteed check in at the check in time(first for me 20+ years of travel). No offer for an compensation while I wait was made.. was basically told ""tough luck"". When room was ready it was disgusting.. musty and bed backboard had a head grease stain on it with rips in it held together with scotch tape. I requested a new room.. new room was fine. Overall.. dont bother unless its on a discount and you dont care about the experience."
40,The property both inside and out has many beautiful features. The pool area and its waterfalls were amazing. However finding a vacant lounge chair was often impossible. The restaurants were plentiful and very accommodating to our large party.
50,What a great hotel  perfectly located in the middle of the strip  with a bus stop right outside . Rooms are very spacious. The pool was great with loads of sun beds  the pool is not great for young children but it does have a shallow end . Plenty to do and see within the hotel
30,Just got home from 6 days at The Mirage while on vacation. The staff were fantastic the amenities are great and you can't beat the location. However it's obvious this hotel is in need of updating in the rooms and some of the public spaces among a couple of other things. With so many options in the center of the strip and after seeing how beautiful some of the other hotels are it's hard to give this hotel more than a 3 star rating.    We checked in late because of our flight and when we got there they didn't have a room available in the category we booked. We were given a room for the night and had to move the next day. To make up for the hassle they removed half the resort fees so that was okay. It does seem this happens pretty frequently as we encountered ALOT of other people having to switch rooms at the same time we were for the same reason.    The first room we were in was an accessible room (we booked a resort king). This room was in better shape than the second room we were put in and was on a private floor. The room we ended up in was ok but the faux leather on headboard was peeling away in huge spots and I ended up using disinfectant wipes on it because it was nasty looking. We really lucked out with the placement of the room we were given to switch into. It was at the end of the hall on a higher floor with a great view. Never heard a sound the entire time we were there.    As for the pool that is an actual nightmare most chairs were gone within in 45 minutes of opening. Do yourself a favor and pay for chairs at the private oasis. It was the best decision we made during the week!    The smell of smoke in the casino is pretty significant. I didnt realize how bad it was until we were in a couple of other hotels and I thought they were smoke free because their air systems were so good. Also as stated in other reviews there is a distinct air freshener/purfume smell throughout the hotel. Seems like its to mask the smokey stale smell. The Casino had lots of options though could always find a machine lots of choices.    The food options at the hotel are great! They are not cheap but let's be honest that's to be expected if you're eating in the hotels. The frozen yogurt place as you go out to the pool was really good! We had their crepes and waffles for breakfast a couple of times along with frozen yogurt in the day time. Highly recommend that place!    All the staff we encountered were extremely helpful and great. Especially all the Oasis pool staff. Not one bad experience with any staff and they really went out their way to remedy any issue.    You seriously cannot beat the location of this hotel! Overall it was a good week loved the Oasis Pool and the hotel staff were great. My rating is a 3 because of the condition of some of the spaces. Given the cost to stay at the hotel and the general cost of everything else while staying there I expected more.
10,Rooms were not as advertised (small and AC didn't work) Bare Bar is not topless and that's why we stayed there in the first place (hotel advertising still says topless European pool) terrible customer service upgraded resort tower was NOT an upgrade at all.
50,From the time we checked in this hotel was amazing...rooms were clean and nice. The casino was good never had a problem finding a chair at a table. Otoro was very good enjoyed our food immensely. Great location on the strip with easy access to many other attractions!
40,This is not our first time staying at the Mirage but it was our first time in 4 years. When checking in around 6PM on a Sunday you really never know what is left what room you will get. I requested any upgrade they could offer as it was our anniversary. As expected they gave us a Tower Deluxe room which really offers a bigger bathroom and separate elevators.    We were given room 25085 which had windows on both sides of the room we were at the end of the hall which is a nightmare and Vegas hallways never end!! I was still happy about the upgrade though being at the end of the hall meant less foot traffic noise which I appreciated.    We did use the pool one day the hottest day of course and we arrived at the pool area aournd 8:45 and was surprised to see the line up go through the pool out to the habitat now I figured there would be a line up but not this long. Once the pool opened at 9 AM people ran to get the lounger they wanted and by 9:10 AM the whole pool area was full not a lounger to be had!    Drink service started at 11 AM and the larger drinks are $24 and the smaller ones were $15 they brought them quickly and they were by often. We ordered the poolside nachos as a snack we were quite disappointed in them they had I think Velveeta cheese instead of real cheese.    We did eat at Cravings one morning and as usual it was excellent! I have done the dinner buffet and not so good but that was our trip in December breakfast in my opinion is there best buffet. We did have to wait about 10-15 minutes but not bad at all.    Like everything on the strip things are more expensive here. Your Starbucks at home for $2.25 will now be just shy of $5 and that can of beer you get at Walmart for $2.25 will now be $4.25 at CVS. Just be prepared and plan plan plan!
50,The Mirage is located very centrally on the strip so you can walk most anywhere you want to go. The rooms are very nice and clean the food is excellent. We have stayed numerous times at the Mirage and all of their restaurants feature delicious food and great service. The Heritage steakhouse was an absolutely fabulous dining experience!
30,Experienced issues with the exhaust fan in the room after showering the entire room became hot and muggy making the room nearly impossible to enjoy. At check in received bad information from front desk which lead me to believe we could not check in until mid afternoon (we arrived at 430 am after a 13 hour drive)
50,As a fairly large group of 16 we were very impressed with the Mirage. The staff are friendly and supportive of new players. It was easy to get around and the centre bar was a great meeting place. We had a lot of fun playing poker both cash and low stakes tournaments. We had a lot of luck on the craps and on some of the slot machines (Willy Wonka provided a lot of entertainment) and so did the Simpsons. Most of the group had some decent wins. We ate in several of the restaurants Cravings was good value for the money. Pizzas are good and large. Heritage expensive but very good quality. Rooms were fine. The only down side was trying to get a bed by the pool which was nigh on impossible. Concierges were brilliant. I would suggest getting a cabana if there is a big group of you as this is well worth the money. Use Uber rather than the cabs by the lobby as far cheaper. drinks can be a bit slow coming when it is busy.
50,This was my first stay at the Mirage and sure won't be my last. Love the tropical atmosphere throughout the casino and especially the pool. Check in and check out went fast ad smoothly Great location on the strip with plenty of fast food restaurants right across the street for the fussy children
40,When checking in to a basic king room to celebrate our anniversary we were upgraded to a basic suite at no charge to us to make our trip extra special. The larger bathroom and strip /pool view was great!
40,"The Mirage is a beautiful hotel small enough to easily get around. The pool area is pleasant with shaded and sun areas although it did get crowded and people had a hard time finding seating. While the hotel did not offer a ""fast food court"" like some of the other hotels along the strip for that quick bite the buffet was excellent with plenty of options to please everyone in the group. Plenty of slots to choose from. The Sports Room allowed us to follow the Bucks during the playoff games as well as the Brewers."
50,We stayed at the Mirage because the convention we were attending was being held there. The rooms were very nice and clean and the hotel staff was friendly and accommodating. There was plenty to do inside the hotel and everything was in walking distance on the strip.
30,Staff pleasant and helpful. Value only average. Daily resort fee slightly excessive. Bathroom tiny though very clean. Bed large and comfortable but retained too much heat. Room very clean in general. Slots a little tight. Not an unpleasant stay just nothing outstanding.
50,We stayed in a Mirage Suite and loved it. The two bathrooms were great. Would have like two showers instead of a soaking tub in one bathroom. The suite had a small refrigerator but did not have a coffee maker much to my husband's dismay. The Suite was very quiet at night. We literally did not hear another person on any of the four nights we were there and our suite was located right off of the elevator. We had 4 separate elevators that went to the Suite floors so there was no waiting at all. The Still is a great new sports bar with a food truck right inside. The food was absolutely delicious and the chefs were friendly and helpful even coming out to visit our table when they heard we were back for a second night because the food was so good. If you plan on going to the pool you better get down there early to get a good seat. All the chairs go fast and we were there in April so I'm sure they go even faster in the summer months. My husband and I had a wonderful trip and even won some money!
40,Once we parked we didn’t need our car during our stay. We enjoyed the Terry Fador show dining in the Japanese restaurant the pool and walking to nearby areas such as Bellagio to see the water music show brunch at Hash a go go souvenirs at the shops on the strip and seeing the sights of the local area. We found the beds comfortable; rooms ok size; a bit disappointed that volcano was not near our window (as pictured for volcano view room) and glad we asked about our charges. Just picking up something from the mini bar to take a look adds it to the bill. Who knew? Anyway- overall positive experience.
50,Great Hotel/Casino...Friendly staff Great Restaurants and Best Location on “TheStrip”. The Mirage is not the overwhelming size of most of the other Hotels on the Strip. Easy to get around with a large variety of table and slots games.
40,I had stayed in another Las Vegas hotel a few years previously ... but I'd forgotten just how huge they are! I had been looking for somewhere that included breakfast - but realised that none of them do because if all the guests turned up in the one place for a meal they would need an army to feed them !    The bedroom was a good size the beds comfortable and everything was as expected. Just make sure you leave enough time - as it takes about 10 minutes to get anywhere in these enormous properties.    We tried the pool club the day we were leaving and despite it starting to get a bit cooler it really was a nice way to finish the stay here. I can imagine in the busy season the pool gets packed - but when we were there it was fairly quiet.
20,"The Mirgae will be 30 years old this year. While still a fairly nice place it shows its age and needs some serious TLC to get it back to some sort of former glory. We stayed in a Penthouse Suite and it was really worn: dirty worn carpet in the bedroom lots of obvious damage to the furniture and some of the 30 year old ""technology"" no longer worked. This suite needs a complete remodel to be worth what was charged for it.    The worst feature--if it can be called that--is the advertising screen that covered all the windows totally ruining the view. That one thing ruined the room for us. A real stupid move on the part of management. However the housekeeping staff did a good job of keeping the room as clean as possible.    We felt the restaurants--aside from the buffet--were over priced for what you received.    Lastly the pool was horribly crowded with a mass of humanity so we reserved an over priced cabana that was very comfortable and nice.    Needless to say we won't be staying at the Mirgae again."
40,It’s vegas what do you expect! We have stayed at many properties in Vegas from the MGM Paris Wynn etc. All are pretty much the same.    There was a small but very efficient check-in line.    The room was good clean and well appointed. I wish they had coffee here. Starbucks is a short walk.    As always plenty of shops restaurants snack places etc here.    I took the wrong key out one day my wife and kids by the pool. They have security wandering around the floor all the time and he kindly validated me with control and let me back into the room again showing my ID - but saved me going all the way down to the pool and back again which is probably a 30 min round trip    My only 2 niggles:    1) By 915 am most of the sun-loungers had gone and people were out. See pics.    We have two young kids with us - 6 & 9yrs old. The pool area was a. Decent size but a) they don’t want you having fun in the pool. They blow the whistle at you - instead it seems its for sitting around at 10am drinking beer on the edge and b) there are no umbrellas at all - unless you pay for a cabana or the special area.    2) Trying to add my M Life rewards number seemed like a mountain out of a mole hill for no reason.
20,First and last stay at this hotel. We normally stay at Mandalay Bay and have never had an issue. These rooms were old and out dated plus smelled musty. Pool area didnt have enough chairs and filled up super quickly. They shouldnt allow people to reserve a chair all day by throwing a towel on the end of it.
50,I have been staying here since the casino opened and will continue to stay and enjoy my vacations here. everyone is friendly and helpful. location is good many things to do and food is great. wish I could get away more often.
30,It is an average stay ... just be aware on top of the resort fee you have to pay 15$ dollars every night for parking .. staff are ok casino is ok.. nothing out of the ordinary .. cable skipped or froze often...
20,At check-in they might promise you to wave resort fees to downgrade your room reservations. At check-out they will tell you they did but in your final bill (They charge $300 to your CC at check in for incidentals) you will notice they did not waive them ($40 a day or so).    Also do not touch the in-room fridge. They will charge you if you put anything at all in it. Outrageous charges for a simple bottle of water (In-room).    Avoid the buffet. Stale looking food. Not the best selection or quality.
50,We absolutely love the Mirage for many reasons and are always so glad we decided to stay there again when we visit Las Vegas. Our flight to Las Vegas on arrival day was cancelled and at 6 pm I called to say we couldn’t arrive for two days which was the flights we were rebooked on. To my surprise they simply moved my package no problem or fees! Now that is customer service!!    The rooms are beautiful and spacious and housekeeping was excellent throughout our four night stay. The pool is lovely and we enjoyed going every afternoon. We ate in the Osteria and at California Pizza Kitchen both quite good. Food prices are high but it’s typical for Vegas. We especially love the location of the Mirage easy walk to most Strip hotels.
20,Power electrical review for client generator and ups buildout first visit of 10    Next visit every month through 2020 or until project finished    Next trip with client meeting to be discussed due to issues on this trip
50,I would definitely recommend the Mirage to my family and friends. The facility was clean and well kept. All of the recommendations that the staff advised were all on point. We especially enjoyed the Steak house and the rum bar.
50,We have stayed here twice and we have enjoyed our stay both times. The pool is awesome. The location is great. The food is really good! Easy to access everything. My husband is in a wheelchair and he loves going there.
50,Staying at the Mirage is an amazing experience. They are so friendly. Great amenities restaurants and gaming machines. So much fun. I would recommend staying at the Mirage to everyone who likes to be pampered.
50,Overall it was a great experience @ the Mirage. The rooms were so clean and they always came to keep them clean and organized while we were away having a good time. We will definitely stay there again. The only issue we had was the long line checking in.
50,Great location. Beautiful hotel. Offers variety of entertainment options. Pool very nice. Staff friendly and helpful. Casino offers variety of “old school” and new fun slot machines. Gambling tables with a low minimum and lessons would be desirable and would draw new patrons.
40,Another fun gf trip. Enjoy staying at the mirage. Rooms are great. Beds comfy sheets always feel cool. Always have to ask for more towels by end of first morning. Great coffee shop restaurant.Really like the location of the Mirage too. Close to walk to the mall or a couple other casinos.
50,When booking a trip to Vegas The Mirage is always my first choice.  The staff are friendly the rooms are dated but clean and the beds and pillows are comfortable.  The Mirage is smaller than other hotels which makes it easy to get around. It is also located close to the Fashion Show Mall.  Looking forward to my next visit.
40,Mirage great location good price. It has a great swimming pool. It has a buffet that includes beer and wine for nothing extra. The rooms are clean as is the whole resort. Staff are all friendly and eager to please.
50,The Mirage is a great hotel. The room was very comfortable and excellent service. The swimming pool area is outstanding but very crowded. It is at the opposite end of the strip to the famous Las Vegas sign. Don't walk to see the sign catch a cab.
20,We Expected atleast mini fridge in the room but none. There is no house kerping next day. Check in and check out lines are huge and front desk is real slow. Not a value for money. Resort fee they charge is good for pool. No free parking. Then why should you pay so much to stay in this resort?
40,Chose the Mirage for this year’s stay so I had better access to the north end of the strip - Venetian/Wynn. Good decor and layout and much improved choice of restaurants since my last stay. Rooms could do with an upgrade but they are clean and comfortable. Only downside is the the size - after a long day on the strip the last thing you need is a 15min walk to get to your room from the front of the property - but it’s a small downside against lots of positives.
30,Nice enough place but nothing to make me want to stay there again. Not enough variety of places to get a quick bite or cup of coffee. Not a big Starbucks fan so would be nice if had coffee maker for AM.
30,Classic case of getting what you pay for here. It’s a mid-priced hotel delivering a mid-priced experience.  Check in was fine other than one poor toddler screaming at the top of his lungs for several minutes while his Mom just looked at him. We didn’t realize it was spring break in Vegas so at that point we decided just to embrace the “family” atmosphere.  And there are children. Many of them. Many hundreds of them. Looked like the parents were taking a break from parenting. The casino did a good job keeping the kids off the casino floor proper but it does detract from the experience if you are near an aisle.    The pool area is nicely designed and enjoyable for about an hour at opening. Yes you do need to queue up at 8:30 ish. You can have a pleasant swim for a few minutes. However they really do need to set a limit for how many people can be in the complex at one time. On a weekday late morning in April there are people lying everywhere on the cement. When we left about noon we offered our front row loungers to a young family only to have another couple arrive to start a dispute over it. Really quite comical in a way with the ever present Mirage dynamic of screaming children as the backdrop.  A saving grace for this complex is the Dolphin Bar. Good service. Nice setting.  It would really help the experience if the pool would open at 7:00 like Bellagio rather than 9:00.    Room was a tower king. Was adequate. Some trouble with toilet flushing and bathtub drainage but otherwise fine.    Really like the atrium and waterfalls. The place was kept clean throughout.    Overall it was a decent experience.
40,This was our first stay here and for an older hotel it was great. Food was very good at the restaurants we ate at. I highly recommend the LVB burger place. Especially loved our volcano view room. Would definitely stay at the Mirage again.
10,Check in was so long and slow. We had to wait in a very long line. Very high resort fees and have to pay $15 per day during your stay for parking. The room with nothing spectacular with no personal use of fridge allowed no microwave and a tiny tv with crap channels. Poor insulation the hall noise was so loud.  The casino will lick people out for being too intoxicated but then won't escort them out. We were tackled on the escalator by said individual(s). They then processed to the parking garage to.. Drive home?!?  Drunk obnoxious people everywhere after 11pm the elevators.. The hallways.. Bathrooms.. restaurants.. Parking garage. Poor security. Felt unsafe in the evenings.  Overall not impressed with our first and last stay at the Mirage.
50,Our vacation was wonderful our stay at the Mirage was a great experience I would highly recommend this hotel. The entire staff was outstanding and when we requesting information or more towels from Housekeeping our needs were met in a timely manner. The entire hotel was very clean.
50,Had a very enjoyable vacation the hotel overall is very refreshing and provides excellent service throughout. There are many restaurants and other venues to keep you occupied. It's like a tropical vacation without the beach!
50,We travel yearly to Vegas to celebrate our wedding anniversary and my husbands birthday which happen to be on the same day. Never have had a bad experience. Have been doing this for at least the past 12 years. Clean safe and very friendly staff.
40,Great hotel room was very nice bed was super comfortable and had a great time seeing Bill Maher (Mirage) and the Backstreet Boys (Planet Hollywood). I would reccomend this hotel to anyone. The staff was also very helpful and friendly.
50,Had a great stay at the Mirage. Wonderful staff and amenities. Just wish they limited the areas where people smoked. And that check in was easier and faster. Help at the checkin kiosk would be very helpful.
50,Mirage is a great place to stay in Vegas and the staff at the Hotel is outstanding.the casino host are extremely helpful and take care of all your needs. The rooms are clean and well taken care of. The restaurants are outstanding and with a great selection
50,Excellent location - very nice hotel. Great buffet with great selection. we were smack in the middle of all of the hotels we enjoy. Caesars is right out the door Venetian is across the street. The casino has a nice variety of games and the pool is amazing
30,Was told I got upgraded to the Staywell floor. Nothing in the room worked for supposed upgrade. Casino seemed outdated and the dealers were kind of rude. Comps were super weak really didn’t get much for all of the play I did.
50,This was our first visit to Las Vegas and won’t be the last. My husband and I had a wonderful time and were very pleased with our stay at The Mirage. Loved how the hotel always smelled lovely even with the annoying smoking (that was the only downside). The staff were all very friendly and helpful and our room on the 6th floor was very clean and spacious. The tropical gardens around the hotel and pool are stunningly beautiful and although the hotel is large we found it very easy to navigate. We would definitely stay at this hotel again.
10,This hotel is a disaster. I was made to wait for 3 hours to check in. Finally checked in at 6:00PM. When I confronted the manager she told me that 4:00PM is not a guaranteed time for check in but rather an estimated time ????  This is the first time I heard that. Totally disrespectful and unfriendly staff.
30,I never received a text when our room was ready so we ended up sitting around waiting for hours.  Guest elevators are very far from the exit.  We could hear every little noise from the hall when inside of our room which woke us up multiple times.  Our room door would not latch shut on its own and therefore remained opened multiple times.  The card key system took multiple attempts to unlock each time.  There was hair on the bathroom mirror when we arrived and what appeared to be a stain on the entry way tile.  The WiFi never connected from our room and when I called the help desk they tried to fix it with a temporary solution rather than identifying the actual issue. The WiFi was also of very low quality everywhere else on the property so I eventually gave up on even using it. Although it had little impact on me I couldn’t help but think of how inconvenient it would be to an international guest.  There was trash in the same elevator for four days straight.  When we brought our concerns to the front desk staff they simply offered to waive our resort fee rather than offering actual remediation of the issues.    We were happy with all of the staff we encountered throughout the facility though. All were kind and attentive to our needs including pool staff bartenders waiters spa staff and dealers in the casino. I would honestly only consider staying here again if I planned on spending 99% of my time at the pool. I’d rather sleep at the pool or in the spa than in this room again. Otherwise I feel I can stay elsewhere and experience the same or better quality. I hope to hear of improvements in the future.
50,We love the Mirage! It's our favorite on the strip. Not too large not too small beautiful pool great rooms friendly staff. The variety of restaurants makes sure there is something for everyone. We will definitely be staying there again.
30,It was way too expensive for what I got. I spent thousands of dollars this past weekend at the Mirage on the room substandard room service an overpriced salon visit tight slots slow drinks at the tables etc... It was my 50th birthday so we bought front row seats for Bill Maher which was also disappointing despite the fact that I'm a huge fan. I'm actually really sad that I chose to do this for my 50th. I was hoping that it would be a memorable experience. 🙁
30,This was our second time here and experienced a repeated occurrence with not getting the room we reserved and paid for. We reserved and prepaid for our room only to arrive to be told it had been sold and we would have to take a room that was not similar to our reservation. The desk attendant did what she could within her role to rectify the situation by putting us on the stay well floor but we ended up in a room near the end of the hall and with no view. Also the parking was full even though we paid for it. Our best advice we received from hotel security was to drive the strip find parking and walk back. Frustrating! We enjoy the location and the fire show is always fun. Just not sure we will be choosing the Mirage for a future stay.
50,The hotel started out right when they credited me a night stay because I was stranded in North Carolina. So nice of them to do that!! Beautiful hotel. Friendly staff. Nice pool. Loved it. I would stay again anytime.
50,Just came back from The Mirage after spending 5 nights there with my wife. We never stayed at this hotel before so was a little worried when we checked in. The gentlemen at the front desk Kyle could not of been friendly. Answered every question and always had a smile on his face. Got us to a room earlier than check in time but had to switch from a Kind bed to a Queen. In the end I think it was for the better. Super quiet on the floor which was the 9th and that even was at nighttime when I expected it to be loud in the hallway. Clean room spacious and both shower and toilet worked great. The pool was amazing and we used it everyday. Does get crowded but we always found chairs and customer service at the bar was awesome! Some reviews I've read said the smell in the casino or cigarette smoke was bad but not for us. Hardly noticed it unless you sat right next to someone smoking. Had a great interaction with a pit boss named Dan at the Roulette wheel. He was so friendly and kind that I told him he needs a raise!! Overall everything was great and can't wait to go back. We wouldn't think of staying anywhere unless except the Mirage! Thanks Mirage you made our vacation perfect.
50,1st visit Here for business. large hotels be prepared to walk alot. Comfy shoes are a must!! Pool is fantastic. make sure to visit the secret garden and dolphins well worth it  The tigers and lions were great to see so close!
30,When we arrived the hotel had sold our room. They did put us in a suite which was nice with a promise of an early move the next morning we heard nothing until 6.50pm when we were threatened that we would be locked out of our room if we didn't move straight away so we literally had to throw everything together which made us late for a show we had booked One of the party left a mobile in the room so we rang the hotel and were basically pushed from pillar to post whilst trying to retrieve same. Front counter staff seemed unable to pass a message between them and other parts of the hotel. Whilst we were compensated the issues we encountered were entirely the hotels fault and avoidable .. by American standards the service was poor.
10,Front Desk Staff/Manager rude upon check in  Rooms are old and very dated  Do Not Get A Room on the lower floors - Hotel lights will shine back into the room causing a very restless sleep.  Pool is cold - not heated
30,Overall the stay at the Mirage is average and is not suited for young children who require heated bottles of milk.    Positives: great location good restaurants in the hotel can provide an extra fridge beds are reasonably comfortable staff are friendly enough dolphin habitat and secret garden is good for kids.    Negatives: no way to heat milk for young children as the hotel doesn’t provide kettles/bottle warmers/microwave bathrooms are small and showers not overly great rooms aren’t as clean as I would expect sound travels down the corridors.
50,Employees don’t leave there- great sign  Central location is the best  Best pool in Vegas  It may be 30 years old but it’s well kept!!!  Great food choices from a deli sandwich at Carnegie to a great steak house at Heritage
30,Nice people. Superior King room was just ok. Room itself was big and spacious however bathroom was extremely small. Pool was packed with tons of people saving seats with towels on them security did nothing. From 8am-10am you will wait for an hour to get into any of the restaurants of coffee shops for service. Its CRAZY busy between these hours. I have had better stay at the Flamingo Harrahs NY/NY.
30,The hotel is pretty but the king tower suite was not worth the extra money. The room was cold. There were 2 of us and only 3 bath towels and 2 hand towels. No wash cloths and the towels were not very soft. Also the bedding was a little light - I always seemed to be cold.    Table limits always high.    Buffet and pool cafe food was excellent though!
40,Everything was exceptional except I received 3 bug bites in bed. Fortunately I was able to move to another bed in room and there were no more bites. I reported the bites the next morning and was told that their service in risk management would close the room for service and have my concerns evaluated. Still waiting for results.
40,We were 2 couples that are in our mid twenties. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. Amazing food and service at the restaurants but many cocktail waitresses would not even acknowledge us. The few that did stop we're always nice and timely. We would always tip $5 or more for a round.  Don't let that stop you from coming it's a great place to stay and gamble.
10,When asked at the mlife desk i was lied to about the resort fees. I asked if i could be comped for the resort fees and was told no because the promotion i was on didnt have me paying any resort fees that they were waved. When i checked out i got charged the resort fees and when i went back to the mlife desk the person that told me the fees were not applied lied to me and said she never said that. And then kicked out
50,I love the mirage it’s staff and the casino. I have never had a bad time in the their resort. The rooms are well kept and the Casino is immaculate...they put a smell in the air that is amazing and you can’t even smell the smoke!
50,Located center strip so very convenient. Room was nice but bathroom was small. We stayed in a Stay Well King room. It appeared to be recently renovated. We attended the Beatles Love show and Siegfried and Roys secret garden and dolphin habitat which both were very good.
20,"We needed 3 rooms for our stay. At check-in 2 of the rooms had not been cleaned (one even had the beds still un-made and towels laying on the floor. The other had womens' underwear IN the bed empty bottle on the counter -- but the beds were made and the room ""appeared"" cleaned. Just gross    Just like a mirage -- the outside looks nice but inside...."
30,Nice room but self park garage is a very long walk to the hotel elevators. No luggage carriers available. Used mobile check-in before arrival which means inputting info already provided with the reservation again only to find the mobile machines malfunctioning upon arrival causing further wait times. Nice room but very pricey for the value received. However great location for the hotel.
40,We just spent 3 nights at the Mirage. It is a nice older hotel. We stayed there because we saw Bill Maher & that is where he performs. It is a fairly nice hotel. The location is fantastic. Stack is a really good but fairly expensive restaurant. The pool area is great. It gets really packed so get there early. Overall the Mirage is a great place to stay.
10,We stayed 2 nights and were very disappointed in spite of number of good Starbucks and restaurants in the building. The pool area was noisy and full as there was no beds available. Upon check out 03/31 the Mirage applied incorrect surcharge and after our claim to the frontdesk Manager we were astonished over her rude behaviour and poor service. Next time we will check in across the street at Wynn or Venetian which seems to be a better choice and gives us a much better experince.
50,Resort is nice and clean. Room was nice. Just wish there were more amenities like a fridge or coffee maker in the room. Pool was heated and clean. Restaurants were delicious. Highly recommended to anyone
50,It had been awhile since I stayed at the Mirage. We were pleasantly surprised. The staff was friendly and the food was great. Very convenient to the Sands Convention Center and all the other hotels/casinos on the strip.
50,We stayed in two Tower rooms @ Mirage last year in August.  I was impressed first of all by the doorbell/valet service at the entrance despite the crowd & traffic we had somebody attending us & the luggages right away explaining us the parking etc. Checking online is great. In a nutshell 5min after stopping our car in front of the hotel we were in our room on the top floor. Nice rooms looked renovated great view. We had the breakfast buffet and it is very nice (food quality especially as we are not that interested by quantity). The pool is great even if crowded. You can find a place to lay down easily.  Only negatives :  - ridiculous prices for minibar (18$ for a water bottle)  - security is really stupid with kids (I know it's not the Mirage it's Vegas). Yes I want you to check that they are not playing but not to hassle them every time they stop in the hallway (yes gambling is there they know !).  - At the buffet the waitresses would always place us at the entrance leaving the tables closed to the buffet empty...for nobody else !
40,If you want to be on the strip and love a casino this is the place for you. Make sure you watch the eruption show out front of the hotel. It was pretty cool. Plenty of restaurants but they aren't cheap. In fact nothing in Vegas is cheap
50,"I have attended the ISC West Conference every year and have enjoyed staying at the Mirage the most. It feels like ""coming home"" when I walk through the front door and past the waterfalls to the main casino area.It is layed out well and easy to find everything. It has been the least ""casino smokey"" on the casino floor."
30,Location and pool were amazing! Housekeeping staff was helpful and fast. Several issues upon check-in. Upgraded room was no upgrade. Not very clean when we got there (fixed that right away). Room was worn and tired. Wanted to charge us $35 a day for a mini fridge as we were not allowed to use the mini bar to store our food! Seriously??!!
40,The pool area is nice but the poolside servers end too early. Dolphin habitat looked interesting but we didn't have an opportunity to explore it. The hotel is nice but our room needed a little attention. Plus there are not enough power outlets.
40,"Got comp tickets from MLife for P!ink concert . We had our choice of hotels to stay at and wife said lets go back to the Mirage. Although we go to Vegas every year It's been about 10 yrs since our last time at the Mirage. We landed late 10;30pm and had rooms already checked in through mobile site. We when got to the hotels the check in kiosk were closed and since we checked in were allowed to go to VIP check in(were not VIP) got room keys in about 5min considering there was a fairly long check in line. Got in room and wife said I""m so thirsty and grabbed a smart water off the desk NOOO! too late was charged 18.00 for water lesson learned but she's worth it. Down to the casino just as I remembered this casino is big but not like other hotels and you can get lay of the casino very quickly. Every staff we encountered was gracious and very helped. Almost all dealers friendly and fun too play with. Every once in a while would get a stoic dealer but just wouldn't play at that table. Only ate at breakfast buffett one morning 21$ not bad for Vegas good selection. dinner at Heritage steak house have been before and did not disappoint 2 drinks seafood tower for 2 salads one steak big enough for splitno desert $186 without tip not bad. Mlife comp P!ink tickets at Tmobile center Lower row upper deck very nice seats. If you haven't seen P!ink in concert go! it's not really a concert but a complete show with her flying out to the audience on wires. Overall excellent stay no problems and would go back. Even had good luck there and came home with more $$$ than we brought. Also get MLife card they even knocked off 250 room bill from 2 1/2 days of play"
30,This is maybe my 10th trip to Vegas over the years and it's coming down the list of favorite places to visit for work or play. The whole culture has changed. No more just walking down the strip it's been built up enough that you have to walk off strip to the overhead cross walks and back down to the street for every major street crossing.  Gone are the days of walking in and out of each casino for the experience. It seems you have to to walk through miles of extremely expensive retail shopping and hundreds of thousands of people. Inside the hotel my $2.xx cup of Starbucks coffee costs 6.00  and the specialty drinks are reaching 10 bucks. Automated refrigerators in the rooms with RFID tags so when you take a drink out of the refrigerator to look at you are billed 10 bucks. Move 4 to see the inventory and get changed 40 bucks. The hotel book says if you want a refrigerator call housekeeping and they will bring one up - at $35 bucks a day. Booked a all inclusive through Expedia and you still get hit with $40 day resort fee ... I was there for a convention and did not use any of the mirage facilities except my room and the path to the front door. Careful shopping can get you a room in Vegas cheaper than the resort fee and for the most part the same or better quality facility.  The Mirage while a nice place is getting worn and needs a facelift. Vegas used to be a place where you could drink and eat cheaply if you spent time in the Casino's now that doesn't matter It's turning into a failing Atlantic City. The two new ball teams are going to just make things worse and they have built up the strip that you hardly can see any sunshine there during the day. They are succeeding in packing too much stuff in too small a place trying to monentize the area. Not suprising looking at the real estate that stands on the strip now someone has to pay for it. We also found this trip that the taxi drivers were very rude but the Uber and Lyft Guys were a pleasure to deal with I won't be using a taxi again in Vegas. It's easy to see there is a problem when Caesars has put them up for sale for 5 billion that doesn't include their 23 billion in debt. The way they tore down the old casio's and built new ones apparently isn't working very well for their bottom line and they are actively working on your checkbook once you get to Vegas. One last thing we booked a strip view room and ended up with a pool side room and no view of the strip. Once we got that corrected we realized the million candlepower lights that illuminate the front of the hotel made the room light enough to read a book with the curtains closed. The Mirage is not on my list of favorite places to stay in Vegas.
50,For just over $20 this was excellent value for money. Try the omelette bar. I had jalapeño bacon and mushrooms with two types of cheese. With a little bacon on the side. The smoked salmon was also excellent. Worth a visit.
50,Everything was excellent from the staff to cleanliness of the room. 5+ stars in my opinion. We will visit Mirage again on our next vacation. The Dolphin show is a must see as well. The Cravings Buffet has so many items to choose from but I’d have to say the Beef Brisket was my favorite.
40,We came here looking for a bite to eat and stuck around because it didn't stink and was relatively clean.    The Mirage is towards the top of the strip and has some great places to eat! I recommend the LVB.    My only complaint is that I wish it was smoke free and the volcano was more frequent.    The wifi is free and very strong! Also there are many pokemon stops all over!
50,Comfort and convenience. Easy check-in friendly service great amenities and easier checkout. We spent more time on the property this year than we have in years. The social setting worked into several business meetings.
50,We chose this casino because it's location and rooms. This is our second year and we hope to make it there again next year. Right in the middle of the strip. We like many of the restaurants there as well as the slot choices.
50,Close to everything (for Vegas) clean modern hotel. Great buffet and room options. Watched Beatles LOVE show and it was fabulous. Friendly staff who go out their way to help with accommodations. Won money too!
50,"Very impressed with the total experience here. I utilized the mobile check-in service. and was impressed that I was able to get to my room within an hour before my estimated time of arrival. The room was on the 24th floor and was very well kept up. The bathroom was spotless everything about the room was great. Had 1 minor issue though this establishment has the convenience of snacks/beverages. They will automatically deduct the cost the moment you remove it from the sensors. Be warned if you travel with children to have them ""disable"" this type of service."
40,We were staying there for 4 nights with a family of 4 in one room.  Room wasn’t big but it was clean.  Towels and beds were done everyday.  Good service amazing pool with dolphins (for extra money)  Good location walking distance to all major hotels around.  Buffet is not amazing but ok  We will be definitely stay there again
40,Amazing amenities casino staff food everything. Rooms could use updating that’s all. But that maybe a personal preference. Room was clean and well stocked. Just a personal presence. Buffet great will be back
50,This was a beautiful resort I would definitely stay there again. Has a lovely atmosphere with just the right mix of relaxing decor (waterfalls and palm trees) mixed with your classic Vegas fun (casinos theatres nightclubs etc). I'd be hesitant to stay anywhere else the next time I return because this resort was awesome- I'm concerned another resort wouldn't live up to The Mirage! The room was very spacious and the king size bed was so comfortable. The restaurants were great and that POOL! Hard to believe that any other Vegas pool would beat the massive pool at The Mirage. We stayed there in late August when temps were high and it was so nice to cool off in the pool in the afternoons. My only complaint is that drinks were quite pricey but of course this is pretty standard for all Vegas resorts. Overall a fantastic experience!
50,Very nice hotel. Great Italian restaurant. Very friendly staff. Prime location to everything on the strip. Will definitely return. The casino is fantastic and I love that they ventilate the cigarette smell so you don't leave smelling.
10,Have stayed at this hotel many times. In past the stays were good. However this week flew hours to Las Vegas. Arriving at the hotel we were informed they wouldn't honour our reservations that we had even paid a deposit on. They did offer us rooms at the MGM Grand so at least we had a place to stay. But the MGM Grand is so much further away and caused us to take taxis or Uber everywhere we wanted to be. They didn't even have the courtesy to let us know in advance.
40,We stayed here in April and was busy but was well located. Able to get to the strip by walking and the hotel was not so big you get lost trying to find your way. The pool was very nice. There was a lot of seating. We got free tickets to go to the adult pool and it is a rip off. It was 100.00 for a lounge chair and we had a group. This used to be he topless pool but now is only adult. Hard to get to also. There were not that many children at the regular pool and you can spread out. We gambled some not a lot. Would have liked to see other slot machines. Went to another casino and played pac man against 3 other friends and had a great time. Overall the mirage was nice. The room was clean the bed was comfortable. The bathrooms had tub shower combo. Lots of lighting.
10,For almost 300$ for one night without being able to see the dolphins/tigers it is a rip off! The Volcano view from the room can be seen from the street. At least a minimum fee for the dolphins/tigers?
40,I usually stay at the Bellagio but I haven't been please with their casino hosts and comps (even though it's also M-Life). This was my first stay at Mirage as part of a group rate for a business trip.    I had a room mix-up due to my comps not being applied correctly and they straightened it out perfectly and the front desk staff was incredibly courteous.
40,Very nice casino and hotel in the middle of the strip. Close walk to other spots. Clean casino with decent air quality! Nice pool area with a beautiful waterfall. Sportsbook is one of the bigger ones with large screens and great place to watch the games.
50,The location was perfect and we especially liked the pool and the pool restaurant. We ate at the restaurant every day. The hotel is like a resort. We have stayed at many hotels in Las Vegas and we like this one the best so far. We are looking forward to going back again soon.
50,Stayed at The Mirage again in a 2 bedroom Hospitality Suite. Last time was the Tower Suite. Did not like the Hospitality as much only because it was dark in the main living area. The windows were in the bedrooms. Large living area with big table which was great for entertaining which we did. Service in the casinos was great. Very friendly staff at the bars. We are coming back again in November and already booked here again. We love this resort.
10,If you’re looking for a room with roaches dirty bathrooms and what are likely to be dirty sheets this is the place for you. Initial room that was assigned still had trash from previous occupant and you could tell that the beds had only been “straightened up” as opposed to changed. Wet washcloth in the bathtub and a dirty towel behind the door.
10,The check-in process was unprofessional. We arrived at noon and understood from the front desk that our room wouldn't be ready till 3:00 p.m. At 3:00 p.m. we attempted to check in and we were informed that 3:00 is only the time that we're able to begin check-in but isn't necessarily the time that the room would be ready. I've never heard a hotel use this line until this visit. Regardless we were told that we would receive a text to in our room was ready. By 4:45 p.m. we still had not received the text so we went back again and we're finally able to get our keys for the six rooms. This is not how people should be treated.
50,Great place to stay in Las Vegas! The hotel and casino were exceptional. All the staff are some of the best I have ever encountered. The rooms are roomy including the ones that are not on the high end. Will stay here again!
30,"Stayed here for Spring break with my teenaged daughters. It was VERY crowded and check-in was unpleasant. Processed in and shoved off. Never told of services amenities shows etc. Buffet line often ""depleted"" and unattended. Servers were nice though. Shows were good. M Life perks are good. Very poor customer service and very impersonal. WE rarely were able to interact with anyone as property has ""automated"" most functions. Not the BEST choice for a family venue. Our expectations were dashed and prices were a bit high."
50,We have stayed at several MGM properties on the strip and always seem to compare the to the Mirage. We find it centrally located and very comfortable. We enjoy the food options and the Casino layout. The rooms are clean and well maintained and the staff goes out of their way to make your stay enjoyable.
50,Nice clean and beautiful casino. Great attentive and friendly staff. Good variety of restaurants with short waits and great service. Lots of shopping choices and an amazing pool area. Left a winner in many ways!
40,We picked the Mirage mostly because of the pool area and the fact that is was centrally located on the strip since we planned on walking most places. It did not disappoint in those areas. The heated pool and the hot tub were both nice even if the air was a bit on the chilly side The view of the strip from our room was also nice extra.
50,In my opinion best hotel on the strip! It is in the middle of everything great casino friendly staff clean rooms and friendly staff! Not to mention they have the dolphin habitat and amazing pools!
50,The Mirage Hotel and Casino opened in 1989. So it it is one of the oldest of the grand new hotels on the Las Vegas Strip. But it remains one of the best. Its notable features continue to set The Mirage apart of its sometimes more celebrated competitors. Located at 3400 Las Vegas Boulevard the four-star 3044-room Polynesian themed hotel impresses visitors from the moment they step onto the property. The original marquee sign in front of The Mirage is the largest free standing marquee in the world. Other one-of-a-kind attractions are Siegfried and Roy's Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat an artificial volcano that erupts nightly at 8 9 and 10 a 53-foot-long eight-foot-tall aquarium that holds nearly 1000 specimen an atrium at the hotel entrance that features palm trees water cascades and rain forest flora a 16000-square-foot nightclub with a New York theme and a poolside lounge in which guests can go topless. Only in Las Vegas. My wife and I booked a King Strip View Room 394 square feet with one king-size bed a 42-inch flat screen HDTV view of the Las Vegas Strip in-room safe min-bar iron and ironing board hair dryer high-speed wi-fi desk and executive chair and access to the fitness center. If you're hungry you don't have to walk outside the hotel. Choose among Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steakhouse the Carnegie deli Paradise Cafe a burger and bar and a pizza parlor for breakfast lunch dinner and a late-night snack. The Mirage answers all of your questions and desires.
40,The Resort is one of my favorites in Las Vegas when I go. But it is starting to show its age. The room I was given smelt musky. hole in wall in hall way. The decor in the romms are dated. The staff I found though was very helpfull and friendly. I love the location of the resort it is right in the middle of the strip giving access to everything there is.
50,Stayed at this hotel last night with my wife. Check in process was really easy and the staff was really friendly.    Our room was a king bed. Rooms are very spacious clean comfortable and offer a nice view depending where you are located.    I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Vegas.
40,The home of cirque de soleil 'Love' definitely worth seeing for anyone who at all likes the songs of Beatles impressive staging and performances. As far as the casino goes as usual I wouldn't really know which one I was in.
10,Checked in at 10pm and they didn’t have my room available. Came back the next afternoon and they still didn’t have my room I payed for. Only King room they could give me was ADA. Super frustrating. Won’t stay here again.
50,If you are looking for a tropical getaway in Las Vegas then the Mirage is the resort for you. Beautiful pool great serviceclean rooms and worth even penny. I am looking forward to many more stays at the Mirage.
40,Would definitely recommend staying here for location & price. This was my second time here & never had any complaints. The rooms are comfortable & great for a short trip. The hotel itself is in walking distance to all prime spots on strip & a walk away from old vegas where you can find plenty of people watching restaurants & street entertainers. The casino inside is decent & has all the variety of game plays possible. Only negative is there seems to be alot of cigarette smell lingering in spots around casino floor & the sportsbook isn’t the best viewing spot. The pool is pretty large & relaxing but would recommend getting there early to get a good spot. Overall for location & price hard to beat.
50,Rooms was excellent condition. Variety of restaurants available. Polite service. selection of machines. Pool was accommodating with multiple chairs friendly servers overall experience was great! Final thought feels like tropical vacation with pool front atrium exterior landscape.
40,The rooms were obviously upgraded as two years ago they were pretty tired. Bed was comfortable. Lighting was fine. Chair was fine as well. Water pressure and lighting in bathroom was good.    But if you want to charge a cell phone by your side of the bed move furniture as there are NO accessible outlets by the beds. In addition can't stand the useless bathtubs in lieu of shower stalls.    Restaurants are all overpriced but with fewer people gambling all over Vegas this is not unique to the Mirage. Drinks are also expensive.    Still a great location but not nearly the premier property it was when it opened.
10,The room smelled of mildew and their only solution was an “odor eliminating machine” which only made the room smell worst. I have asthma and have had breathing issues for the past few days. The wall in the bathroom had bent screws And bolts sticking out if it. There was some disgusting splash back residue or something all over the furniture at the bottom half of everything. I come to Vegas several times a year. I do NOT recommend the rooms here. The casino and The Pantry restaurant was about it.
30,I had previously seen reviews about the 1Oak Night Club showing discrimination but I never knew thought it was true until my friend and I experienced it when we stayed at the Mirage. The security guard let 2 white girls enter the club at around 2am with no questions asked. He was going to turn me and my friend away until I made him aware that we were in the club earlier that evening and left for a few hours and came back. Also when we were at the pool area one of the security was very unfriendly.
50,Excellent hotel at a great location.  Perfect for family. Clean rooms and property. The pool is very family friendly.  The staff was attentive and the crowd was great. Good food options and location makes it convenient to get around the strip.
40,Good location on the strip. Layout good. Not a lot of walking. Good variety of restaurants with all price levels. Recommend the Tower King rooms. Easy to get to. Bed was good...pillows too soft for my liking. Sports bar in Casino good place to hang out.
20,I have ha better accommodations at Holiday Inn Express. The beds are old and the bathrooms are outdated and small. For over $300.00 a night and closer to $400.00 per night I expect a better quality experience than what the Mirage was able to deliver. The hotel rooms were barely average.
40,First off Do not touch anything in the mini-fridge. It is the weird sensor like contraption that will charge you a bazillion dollars for a diet coke even if you move it... had to make a special trip to the front lobby to ask them about what the additional $250 was on my account.  Overall the hotel is very quiet and clean. The cleaning staff does a good job staying on top of it all. The women at concierge was very helpful as well.
10,"Half the pool was closed for a private event even though we payed those rediculous ""resort fees"" to use the entire pool. We reserved a volcano view room but it wasn't ready at check-in so we settled for a pool view room. At niggt there's no view because spotlights shine directly into your eyes."
30,"Soft beds...Not a fan of your pillows. No refrigerator??! Called Mirage directly to book and was sold a 4-night package supposedly based on my ""previous play/betting"" so i decide to ""up"" my betting this trip (at CRAPS) and on the last night i asked did i accumulate enough Rewards (including my friend's minimal Slot Play) for ONLY A BREAKFAST (i was not returning before the 6-month expiration) and i was told THE PACKAGE I BOOKED STARTED ME ""NEGATIVE"" AND I NEEDED MUCH MORE PLAY TO BEGIN TO ACCUMULATE TO THE POSITIVE !!!??? So in other words losing $1000 (which is a lot for me) cannot even buy me a ""FREE EGG"" (yes i'm sure the other hotels have the same stingy policy and you will certainly survive without me) but i will try your competition for my future annual trips."
50,First time at staying there and it won’t be the last. Everything was easy check in great room and staff. They made it easy and it was quiet also. View was amazing and the inside gardens were lovely. I would recommend it for sure.
50,If anything goes wrong they do everything to fix it thank you front desk for all you do very clean room and food was very good lots of choices easy to move around and always help close by great value for your money can’t wait to go back
30,Stayed at the Mirage for a Business Convention. Suites are large but a little dated. Towels reminded me of a larger version of Gym Towels. Not a lot of Gluten Free options for people that are sensitive to Gluten. Meals are expensive but probably not more so than other hotels on the strip. Be prepared to tote your own luggage. Few if any Porters in the arrival area. This is a very busy/chaotic hotel. If you prefer a more relaxed environment try the Four Seasons.
50,You really would not have to leave this property unless you really need to they have everything numerous restaurants buffet entertainment etc... The rooms were very clean beds were comfortable and the view of the strip was excellent.
50,Staff and location were great. Clean and fun environment both in the Casino and the rooms. Good location on the strip was our first time staying on the north end of the strip and it was a blast at that end with the Mirage being a great time and all that is around the Mirage. Will definitely be back.
40,"Property and rooms where fresh and clean very nice.NO coffee maker or frig in rooms be aware of added ""RESORT FEE""- a fee for services that included in room rate at an other place than Vegas. No prices posted on most things I guess ""If you have to ASK"""
40,The hotel was amazing in setting up the activities for our group. Cleanliness and comfortable beds. Coffee makers are needed in the rooms long line ups at Starbucks in the morning!! Breakfast buffet not great. Excellent location.
50,Our experience was very pleasant the tiger & dolphin area was a nice plus & the pool area is beautiful. The Mirage is located in the middle of the strip & easily accessible to other properties.  We would definitely go back
50,You park and that’s it. You don’t need to leave the property for anything. We enjoyed blueberry pancakes and coffee in our room both mornings. Timely and delicious. Anything else your pallet might desire is available here. Great staff and service!
30,Chosen as it was the conference hotel - the staff providing logistics and directional support for the conference were outstanding - friendly and cheerful even at 7 am. This is a landmark hotel in Vegas now. It is time for some upgrades to bring it back to life. Decent for a conference as the hotel rooms are not too far from the convention space but needs some new life all around. Great location on the strip. Close to many of the usual tourist attractions in Vegas.
50,The ambiance and cleanliness of the entire resort is beautiful. Staff throughout the resort from the desk to restaurants and bell desk were all very helpful and courteous. Our stay was very enjoyable overall
30,checked in for the Final Four weekend April 4-7. Stayed in the Stay Well Suite; 12050. The room was nice with a decent view. However the bathroom lacked nicer fixtures. Also old technology for the room.    The casino is just OK. Played blackjack with the slowest dealer ever. Very frustrating. Walked away from the table because of her. The pool is also just meh. Lots of people who's choice of swimwear was she we say not consistent with their physiques. Older crowd. Didn't have trouble finding a chaise so that was OK.    Ate breakfast at the Pantry restaurant. Very slow service. Food was just OK. Also ate at Stack. That place was pretty good. Decent steak and shrimp cocktail.    I wouldn't stay here again. The location is pretty good but it is really lacking any Vegas pizzazz elan or sexiness (and isn't that why people go to Vegas). Has nothing to do with the age of the hotel. Has more to do with the clientele and staff.
40,Staff was very helpful and friendly especially front desk girl who took care of us. She went out of her way to make our connecting rooms happen. Won some money too! that never hurts! Thank you so much loved your resort!
20,Quality of buffet food deteriorated but Mirage increase prices for nothing I visited this hotel many times before and that was different positive experience. No good selection of buffet food and especially desserts. On the top of this unpleasant experience they did not assign any reward points for my M-Life after spending more 10.000 on mostly table games.
40,My daughter and I both had three Myvegas comp nights. The desk clerk was nice enough to find us a room right across the hall from each other. We were allowed to check in a little early which helped us a lot. I really enjoy the greenery around the Mirage and the Dolphin Habitat is neat. I had a good view of the strip while my daughter did not. The rooms are of average size and housekeeping did a good job. Check out was easy and I would consider staying again.    One negative is that faux showgirl performers are allowed on the property. I realize they have to be allowed to ask for money for photos on public property but the Mirage is private property. Realizing Las Vegas has lots of adult entertainment the ladies who had only little pasties on aren't usually allowed on various hotel's private property where they harass people to pay them for a photo right by the Mirage doors.
50,"Sharron put us on the guest list for the ""Secret Gurden"" comes to find out it was the Bare lounge. No where to put your stuff no lockers and everything was money. 100 for a lounge chair was upset put my clothes back on and that said ""your going against dress code?!?! Bare burns your money everything else worth it! I would come back for sure"
50,The resort is beautiful! Relaxing and exciting at the same time! Every staff member was helpful most were so nice and friendly. Staff does an excellent job keeping the property immaculate. I didn't see any trash on the ground anywhere. As a non-smoker I was a little worried about the smoke in the casino. There was a slight undertone of it with a fruity or flowery scent attempting to mask it but it did help and I wasn't bothered by the cigarette smoke. I would like to go back to the Mirage someday to experience more of what the resort (and Las Vegas) has to offer!
50,Wasn't sure what to expect and it turned out to be the best decision. Located in the middle of the action hotel lobby and casino beautifully done lots of indoor landscaping palm trees chic restaurants. I took my kids to Vegas to celebrate my son's turning 21. The Mirage was elegant without being too stuffy. We felt as comfortable in shorts and we did in dress clothes. We stayed in a hospitality suite which was HUGE. I had my own bedroom and bathroom which was as large as the main level of my house. The pool was THE BEST. And it was not too far a walk from the guest rooms as is the case with many of the other hotels in Vegas. Highly recommend!
50,We took a couple trip to Vegas for a little relaxation. We walked the strip visited Fremont Street lay by the pool and saw the Grand Canyon. Excellent trip very relaxing and fun filled. Definitely a trip to take!
50,Stay at the Mirage twice it’s a great hotel in a brilliant location beautiful room superb pool bus stops just out front handy to jump on and offThe shows in Vagas are amazing especially The Love which is on in the Mirage would highly recommended this hotel M&D Middlesbrough
20,"I cannot emphasize enough how magnificent the Penthouse Suite is. It really feels like a mansion in the sky especially for a solo traveller. I have virtually nothing negative to say about the room or the hotel. But you'll shortly understand why this is a two-star review - all because of a problem that could have been prevented and a total screw-up in fixing the problem when I tried to get something done about it.    I checked in on Monday March 25 2019 set to check out the morning of Thursday March 28 2019. I came to discover upon checking in that there was a problem with one of the lights above the bed as well as with one of the automated curtains. The sheers were stuck in the middle of the rail and didn't move with the motor controlled by the switches. The other drapes and sheers moved no problems... though these sheers in particular didn't move. The motor ran but there was no motion on the sheers themselves.    So here's the timeline of how I tried to get that problem solved...    Monday March 25 4:00 pm - Called down to report both problems they said they would take care of it    Monday March 25 10:00 pm - I return to the room to discover nothing happened. I go down to the front desk they said they would send somebody right now an that worked as I was going out for the night.    Tuesday March 26 3:00 am - I return after a night out to discover the light had been fixed but nothing happened with the sheers. So I ask the front desk what's going on... they send one of their engineers right then who is ""one of the best"". He concludes it's a busted rail and it would take some time to fix. Asked me when I'd be out the next day so it can be done when I'm out so they don't get in the way. I told him about 2:00 pm.    Tuesday March 26 2:00 pm - I happened to be in the room doing some work and got a knock on the door from engineering. He asks me what the problem is. He had NO idea why he was called to my room. Which makes no sense... he's coming now SPECIFICALLY because this is when I'm supposed to be out. So if I was never in the room he would never have known what the problem was! He goes up to check and unsurprisingly finds out it was a busted rail... and apparently the guy who works on this stuff only works on the ""morning shift"" so he'll have him called in tomorrow.    Wednesday March 27 Evening - Nobody has showed up to the room and the problem is still not fixed. I go down to the front desk to complain and they agree to comp off the cost of the upgrade for this room since I didn't get what I paid for in terms of room quality and especially not service quality.    I feel bad because I was fully willing to pay the upgrade cost without any questions. But for a property that seems to take such pride in its service I think they failed pretty badly here. Not just in addressing the problem but also in preventing this. You can see in the photo attached to this review that there's a cord from the rail hanging off in plain sight. How housekeeping couldn't have noticed this and reported it to engineering I have no idea.    I am willing to come stay at the Mirage again but if I encounter any trouble like this again I'll be going straight to the supervisor from the beginning and demanding a room change. There are no excuses for providing this kind of service especially at the Mirage. I'm happy with the resolution but still upset that I had to go through this."
50,I would highly recommend The Mirage as the 'go to' place in Las Vegas. Rebecca Ackermann Executive Casino Host arranged the perfect getaway for us. Rebecca has an exceptional customer service attitude as do all of the staff at The Mirage. We were always greeted and assisted in a friendly and professional manner. Everyone seemed genuinely concerned about our our comfort and satisfaction. Check in was a breeze as was check out. From the valet parking staff all the way to our Executive Casino Host the service was wonderful! I will never stay anywhere else but The Mirage. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
50,Mini vaca with our son while he was in Vegas coaching in a high school baseball tournament. We visited from Jacksonville Fl. Beautiful weather and courteous staff. Enjoyed showing our son the Vegas Strip
10,We checked in to a strong mildew smell. Turned on air and left for dinner and a show. Came back and smell was worse. Our sinuses were burning and we found a long line of black mold along the ceiling. We called and ask to move. We were told we could but we had one shot at getting out of the current room as the key card was rekeyed but it wasn’t and we spent 20 minutes in the hall waiting for security. No one followed up and management never contacted us. Black mold makes the room uninhabitable!
20,I hate when we get put in a room that is the furthest from the elevator when there are a hundred rooms closer that are empty. I don’t know what the noise was outside our window but it was extremely loud. The noise stopped late in the night but it was bad every night.
40,The Mirage is in a great location - in between treasure island and Caesar’s palace and opposite the Venetian its a great spot for wondering around the heart of the Strip. It’s a beautiful hotel well priced and the rooms were amazing - bathrooms maybe slightly smaller than you might expect because all the space is given over to the superbly appointed bedrooms including the most comfortable beds we’ve experienced in a long time. The casino is very nice indeed and makes downtown took a bit tacky m but the minimums are a higher than downtown and the rules aren’t as good (6-5 on blackjacks). Also the servers can get a bit snotty if you don’t tip them enough (ie $5 min). So for these reasons I found downtown to be more fun and more affordable for blackjack and in future I think we would probably stay at the Mirage where the rooms are A1 (and the location fantastic) but catch a 15 minute Uber for about $12 to play blackjack downtown 👍. Some of the bars and restaurants in the Mirage looked sensational although not cheap and if you’re on a budget you can do a lot worse than Denny’s right across the street for breakfast (and in our case dinner as well) or grab a sandwich for $3 from CVS or Walgreens next door. Finally for entertainment the Love show at the Mirage was world class they’ve got an amazing circular theatre in there and some of the routines were incredible. In future I think we would definitely explore more of the evening shows on the strip because there is loads on - James Taylor was on on the Saturday at Caesar’s but we’d left by then unfortunately.
40,A good hotel for a family stay. The casino is very smoky but most of them are. Secret garden and pool are very family friendly. Beatles LOVE was an amazing show. And I have to fill out more characters!
10,Not a place to bring 2 toddlers it seems.    Was denied our request to have 2 child beds. Minibar was not locked when we requested it - especially since one was not I a crib.    Put next to a singe person that called security on us at approx 8:30am as the children woke up not used to the room and took about 10 minuts to stop crying.
40,Mirage has a great location the erupting volcano is fun to watch. Guest rooms need some updating but they are clean. Pool is beautiful and pool area is great. Overall a great hotel that just needs some updating.
50,Looks the best from outside water fountains greenery lava explosions.  Inside is well laid out easy to move around very well decorated.  Rooms of above standard of decoration and spacious with great views bathroom a bit dated needs attention.  Leave the mini bar alone including the water very expensive.  Any stay over 3 days you get a free Buffett  Good free WiFi.  The pool is perfect so many different areas but always jammed packed. Tip for management so many people were leaving towels on beds not knowing if they were being used why not introduce a return fee $10 each towel give room number how many towels and a 4 digit code so nobody can go round picking up all the towels for the $10 return fee.
10,Resort fees are a joke. Have a price without hidden or extra fees. Won't be back to Vegas and i do it will be off the strip and the annoying fees. Big monopoly on the strip and it won't get me ever again!
30,Disappointed this round....didn’t want to go to Disney world and expected a romantic relaxing get away for our anniversary not screaming kids in the rooms and hot tub. Couldn’t even take a nap! Don’t mind paying high prices for dinner but expect quality and service...
50,Beautiful common areas. Wonderful saltwater fish tank. Courteous staff. Tight slots. Not happy that they gave away my room on the night of my arrival since they overbooked. I prepaid the first night.Thats absolutely not acceptable.
50,Had a great time in Las Vegas with a very clean and superb room at the Mirage Hotel & Casino. I would highly recommend to stay at the Mirage. I give the Mirage a score of 100% satisfaction. My wife an I stayed at the Mirage the first April for a storage convention for four days. The food at the restaurants was great. I recommend to go and see the Beatles show at the Mirage. My wife an I highly recommend to see the show. The show is well worth the money to go see.
50,This was our 3rd stay at Mirage and our 10th visit to Las Vegas. Mirage is now the only place we stay and look forward to our next stay there! Amazing location good food nice casino with good selection of games friendly staff and nice rooms .
50,Return trip to the Mirage. Our favorite stay on the strip. Excellent locationstaff and pool area. Restaurants continue to perform with excellent dining options. We have stayed at multiple strip locations but have determined that the Mirage is our number one choice.
50,We had a great time at the Mirage. Comfortable beds clean nice restaurants and a bit of shopping but nothing over the top. Casino is not good compared to other in regards to smoking and plenty of table games.
50,My husband and I stayed here for a business trip for 4 days. We walked through most of the hotels on the strip and the Mirage was by far one of the best! The entire ambiance and experience was exceptional. The new stay well rooms offered increased relaxation with lighting options and aromatherapy. The pool was so relaxing and the dolphins are a must-see! I would stay here over and over again!
30,Booked a one bedroom suite that was wonderful but the Mirage was lacking in service and amenities. I have experienced better value for the money at other local properties. Even just passing through the casino one smelled like smoke the rest of the day.
40,We normally visit Vegas twice a year always choose Mirage based on its location and pool both ideal for our situation. The sports book is one of the strips best I do think the $500 minimum bets for free drinks seems unusually steep
50,Stayed at the Mirage for the first time. Two night stay was enjoyable. Used the fitness center & pool. We’ll consider staying again if we want to stay on the strip. King room was roomy and comfortable with a tub/shower. Only complaint tub plug didn’t hold the water! Resort fee is $37 we didn’t have a car so not sure if parking is extra.
40,I have stayed at the Mirage a bunch of times and like the hotel. Check in is always quick and easy. Service is always excellent. Hotel is located in the center of the strip so location is perfect. LVB Burger has good food. My only complaints - rooms are a bit dated and the hotels does not have enough casual dining choices.
40,The key thing about the mirage is its location. Your never more than a few blocks from the other main hotels / casinos. The mobile check in was also really nice. Overall a good experience would definitely consider going back.
30,Perfect location to get to the mall and other resorts for shows. Mattresses are very hard and some have sunken spots in them. The pool area is really nice and peaceful in the am. This is a good value resort but wish they would do a serious upgrade for their mattresses.
10,"We have stayed at the Mirage before and never had any real issues other than the weird smell that permeates throughout the property. This time was a disaster from the beginning. My husband and I took our children with us to Vegas and stayed at the Mirage. Our girls are 7 and 10 years old. We thought it would be a nice family vacation but instead experienced:  - Horrible check in experience. Used mobile check in but ended up in the long line to check in. Room was not what we reserved or paid for 2nd floor room with view of cement blocks outside. Headboard ripped chair ripped stains on sheets.  - Went downstairs to ask for a different room but they insisted it would be an upgrade to get a different room even though that is what we originally reserved and paid for. Was charged $20 more per night for an ""upgrade.""  - Went to new room keys would not work. We waited while my husband went to desk for new keys.  - Finally into the room and were rather grossed out. BLACK MOLD in bathroom on ceiling in shower. Unflushed toilet. Long black hair in shower (none of us have black hair). Ripped headboard. Dirty windows. Carpet was very smelly. Called front desk to ask for different CLEAN room. Was told I would need to go back down to front desk.  -Went to front desk was told the hair was ours and the mold was not harmful. Really? BLACK mold not harmful?! Was told they could upgrade us again but would charge another $40 per night. Finally decided to do that but then the clerk said nothing else was available. Would not refund our money to go somewhere else. Was very rude but did say he would give us a 2 hour late check out since we had wasted so much time during checkout.  - They charged us for late checkout. I saw this in my emailed receipt while still at the Mirage. Went to front desk asked for help with this and the lady basically accused me of lying said no clerk would do that. I couldn't remember the other clerks name so she said I was making this up to get out of paying the late check out charge! I disputed this and she finally said she would refund our credit card for that charge. They still have NOT refunded anything and when I have called numerous times to talk to management about this I was told I was lying that the lady clerk never told me they would refund the charge! I am DONE being called a liar by the Mirage!  - Last night there my kids and I were walking through the casino (only possible route) towards our room elevators. My 7 year old stopped to tie her shoe. Within seconds a VERY rude security guard came up to us and told us the kids had to be ""actively"" walking and could not stop. I explained she was only stopping to tie her shoe. He said she would need to tie it once we left the hotel. I told him we were going to the elevators as we had a room there. He said that we didn't have a room and tried ""escorting"" us to the front lobby doors. I told him we were going to our room. He said he didn't believe we were staying there and wouldn't let us turn around to go to the elevators! He actually put his hands on my 10 year old daughter and tried to push her towards the front lobby door! That scared her and she tried to get closer to me and the security guard got on his walkie talkie and called for back up as he ""had a situation with hostile trespassers!"" WTH?! Finally I was able to ""escape"" and get to the front desk where I started quickly telling them what was happening and asking them to tell the security guard we were staying there and the front desk clerk told me he couldn't help! I got on my cell phone to call my husband for help as we were being pushed through the lobby door being told not to come back on the property. So there we were a grown woman and her two young daughters dressed nicely and behaving well being told to leave and not trespass. My husband came down to try and help (he had been in our room). Two other security guards came over and people were milling around trying to find out what we had done that was so awful. It was humiliating!!! My 7 year old was crying and my 10 year old was scared and honestly I was becoming a bit fearful as well!  Finally they let us go to the elevators but escorted us there and when we tried to go to the elevator for the 24/25 floor with suites we were told by security ""there is no way you are staying up there."" WHAT?! We were dressed nice spoke well and behaved well so what did we do to deserve this treatment?!  We will never return to the Mirage. We were treated horribly and it's not worth it to spend money there when we can spend a bit more and stay somewhere else like Caeser's and be treated with dignity and respect."
40,A friend & I stayed here for a few days for a quick getaway. The resort is situated in a great location right in the middle of the strip. There are lots of cheaper options to eat around the Mirage like the food courts in the Fashion Show Mall & McDonalds across the street (great for the morning coffee since there’s no coffee maker in the room).  The pool was great lots of chairs though it was busy in the afternoon in the heat of the day.  The hotel room was clean & comfortable. We had one meal at Pantry which was 10/10. I would for sure stay here again.
50,In this time where indifference is the new norm the staff of the Mirage Hotel and Casino prove to be the difference. The Mirage’s uses an easy to use app to book a room or check in. The room we had was spacious with a great view of the strip. The bed was especially comfortable and the pillows were awesome. The room was very well cleaned daily with no harsh smell afterwards. The staff was not only polite but very upbeat. The food at the breakfast buffet was a good assortment and very well prepared. The slots and games were new and everyone had great energy. I would recommend the Mirage highly!
50,Haved stayed at the Mirage numerous times. Everything in one place we ate all our meals here but one. Dolphins and tigers/lions are well worth seeing we purchase season passes as we go to Vegas more then once a year. Staff are awesome and always helpful. Gift shops are well stocked and lots of choices to eat great food. Lots of slot machines and tables. We’ll be back in the fall.
50,Had a really great visit the hotel staff was very friendly rooms were very clean the restaurant the casino and entertainment was very very nice enjoy this day would recommend to my family and friends thank you
30,The mirage is spotlessly clean in all areas but the stench of weed and tobacco is considerably worse than other nearby hotels. In fact the overpowering stench of weed pervades throughout the hotel areas not just on the casino floor.  Everything in the Mirage is based off the casino compared to other similar properties this is a relentlessly busy area at all times of the day and night. no peace can the found In The Mirage including in the pool area.  The location of the mirage is perfect. Centrally placed on the strip everything is easily accessible. Which is handy as although there are food and beverage options in the Casino the Mirage lacks the range of options available in other nearby properties.  The reception staff are very welcoming but the casino staff particularly the M-life counter were not. where not unhelpful they are certainly not happy to help. This was quite contrary to other hotels we experienced such as Mandalay Bay.  For a so called “luxury” resort their insistence on penny pinching seems unbecoming. For example a strict one small bottle of shampoo  Per room per day (split between two grown men) or the lack of In Room tea/ coffee making facility.
40,Excellent location to walk anywhere on the strip and not expensive to Freemount st. Perfect pool and the Secret garden is an absolute perfect visit. Casino area a bit to crowded together so can’t feel too comfortable but does a halt create a nice night time atmosphere. Only reason not 5 was due to smell of marijuana in my corridor. It room was also excellent
40,Close to everything : Cirque du Soleil show Convention Center restaurants and yes the only volcano in Vegas. Outsandingly courteous and helpful staff. Beautiful pool and fitness facilities. Very quiet rooms allowing for restful sleep.
20,The first night they put me in a room where there was a service door right across from my room. All night doors slamming people talking I requested a room change so I got moved and at around 2 am somebody was trying to use their key to get in my room. Freaked me out couldn’t sleep that night either. The 3rd night people talking loudly slamming doors around 1 am..Casino was so so Smokey I was coughing. My friends who were with me said the smoke was horrible. I have stayed at Mirage at least 20 times. This was my last time resort venealation horrible.
50,I love the location of the Mirage you were in the center of everything. They had a reasonable attractions to keep you busy during your stay. I also loved the room service. Housekeeping was on it to make sure we had plenty of towels and anything else of request.
40,We arrived at 3 PM on a Saturday. No queue at that time so got our room no worries. The hotel room was fine. We never used the fridge (too expensive) but used ice and an ice bucket for our drinks. The hotel is huge with plenty of gaming machines. It also has a zoo of sorts with dolphins and lions tigers and other animals. Well priced to visit. Not sure about the size of the enclosures for all animals - they seem very small (like zoo's enclosure's from the 1960's were).  Great swimming pool area and location is spot on in the middle of the strip. An easy walk to North and South end casinos if you can be bothered. Overall i would use again.
30,The resort seems tired and the rooms need a face lift. I was there for a convention and there were not many places to eat during lunch. The few places that were open had very long line.The staff was very nice.
20,My bathroom had mold inside the shower. Stood on towel to take shower. Carpet dirty and sheets had stains on them....UGH! Five Star Hotel....I think not. Stayed at Luxor last year and was a definite upgrade from the Mirage. Never will stay here again. Wish I had taken pictures.
20,Mobile check-in was a joke. Never received emails or texts to tell me when my room was ready. Waited forever for my very marginal room. I was there for a large trade show at their hotel - thought I would have been treated better. Should have been treated better.
50,This is a great property with a terrific staff and amenities! Plenty of food and bar choices something for everyone! Great room with a view at a great price no fee for early checkin. Property is easy to navigate but pleasant help is always a step away. If you’re a Starbucks fan there is more than one store at this property so you don’t have to go far.
50,Most of the times the Mirage is awesome and I still will come back because of the dealers and waitresses but the front desk and the rooms were just horrible and completely messed up my whole birthday. I will still rate it at 5 stars because all the great times I had there but this was one of the worst Vegas trips ever
50,A Tropical Paradise escape this hotel is hotel is perfectly located. Excellent choice of restaurants beautiful pool area and the best is Siegfried and Roy's Secret Garden! Plus the Beatles Love and Terry Fator are excellent choices.
50,a big thank you to Mirage and MGM resorts when they found out that myself and my sister were breast cancer survivors they upgrade our room. I was touched by the gesture as they didn't have to do it. I am was surprised that such a big resort would do something like that. I am grateful and we had an awesome time at the Mirage. we will return again.
40,We've really enjoyed our stay at The Mirage! Everyone has been friendly and helpful. I'm very impressed that they have great discounts for those who have served in the Military. Bring proof and you get a special player's club card. 40% off the buffet and the Terry Fator Show and many other discounts! Rooms are very nice pool area is gorgeous!
30,"Stayed at the Mirage for a business meeting this past week. Though the volcano is interesting and the pool area nice the hotel itself seems to be getting tired. My room (a ""resort king"") had frayed carpet paint missing from the window sill and reeked so heavily with room deodorizer spray I had to leave the room door open for an hour just to be able to stay there (no windows could be opened). The bath exhaust fan which I turned on to try to get rid of the deodorizer smell was noisy and sounded like it was about to die. The bed was comfortable and the desk area functional.    In terms of services - the check in line when I arrived (Monday at 9pm) took me about 20 minutes to get to an agent. Room service was marginal - breakfast delivered in a paper bag and in plastic containers and the smallest coffee I could get was a box with 5 cups for $18 - all I wanted was a cup. Breakfast of an egg white omelet coffee and one piece of toast was $50 so like most things in Vegas not cheap. The pool area was nice and staff who I met were friendly.    To me there are probably better and nicer places to stay in Vegas..."
10,Customer service here is horrible. You have to wait forever to find a cocktail waitress and when you do finally get a drink it's watered down or has no liquor. The floor looks empty as a result of the shift away from gaming to more family friendly shows and overpriced shopping. Instead if staying here I would recommend the Bellagio the Aria Mandalay Bay/Delano or the Cosmopolitan.
30,Came here with a friend to watch the volcano show and decided to come into the hotel to hang and get something to drink. The place reminds me of rain forest cafe for some reason. It's pleasant but feels very tropical-ish.
40,Good time with teenage kids in Vegas. Mirage is at perfect spot on strip to walk to almost everywhere. Great Pool good service. Many other families were staying at the hotel. The Pantry was perfect for breakfast.
20,Casino needs much better air circulation felt the air quality was better at the Fremont Casinos and they have 10ft ceilings....Guestroom doors were not sealed allowing hallway conversations to be heard and awaking us multiple times between 2-5am.
50,The convenience factor of staying on the strip and having everything in once localized area was great. Food was pricey but was expected. Rhumbar outdoor patio is the best place on the strip to sit down and have a drink and cigar (won't get smoked out from being indoors). The 2 bedroom suite was perfect for my Brother Father and I. Will be back to the Mirage for sure again next year. Convenience baby . . . it's what matters on these trips when you don't want to waste time traveling everywhere!
40,We stayed at the Mirage for our Anniversary. The hotel has been kept up well. Our room was clean and everything worked. We tried to check in early (9am) on a Wednesday but no rooms were available so we left our bags with the Bellhop. Our room ended up being ready @1pm. So still earlier than the 3pm check in time. They gave us a free upgrade to a strip view since it was our Anniversary. I got a great rate on the room (2comp nightsthen $59 per night for 2 nights) since I’m a MLife member. So even after resort fees I still felt like it was affordable. The beds were very comfortable. The room was quiet and we slept well. Overall we had a very good stay. I would recommend the following restaurants: Carnegie Deli California Pizza Kitchen and LVB. All were very good. I would NOT recommend the Mirage Buffet but that is for another review!
50,we enjoy sun and drinks during the day so we used the pool everyday. We did realize you have to get to the pool early to get a decent seat. We obviously went at a very busy time and decided to use that experience towards our next vacation to Vegas if we are able to make it back out there. We love the Vegas atmosphere and the many things there are to do besides gamble. The Mirage is a beautiful hotel and in the perfect location on the strip. We had an awsome time!
40,Hotel is clean. Big. Beautiful. Pool was amazing! We traveled with kids and was slightly disappointed that there wasn’t a mini frig or microwave in the room. Also if there were some more kid friendly food choices. Other than that. We would stay again!
50,Always a great experience at the mirage casino. Fantastic food great gambling and the friendliest staff on the strip. You won’t want to leave. Beautiful flowers and decor. Anything you want or need all you have to do is ask
50,This was by far the best decision to make. We were unsure about going to Vegas. It was our first time and definitely will not be our last. We were able to see a couple of great shows. The Jabbawakee show was absolutely amazing it had a great story line you could follow we had tons of laughs and thoroughly entertained
40,Stayed here 10yrs ago and again last week. Hotel is a bit tired but a great location. Beware of the resort fee that is now charged on departure (didn’t know about this when booking with Agoda). We were charged an extra $251.70 resort fee!
50,I highly recommend The Mirage for any trip to Vegas. Rooms are excellant as are the Resturants. We go to Vegas a few times a year and will allways stay at The Mirage. Try the High Limit room for your gambling you want be sorry.
50,We love staying at the Mirage especially when you have the MyVegas comps. The place is definitely upper end in it appearance and feel. The pool is really nice. There is no lack of places to eat and the video poker by the sports book seems to be loose.
40,Customer service was wonderful. I’d like to see this hotel change back to empty refrigerators and have free parking. Otherwise it was a very pleasant stay and the grounds are beautiful. If you have an issue with anything the staff are more then friendly and willing to help you out. They surly go to extra mile to keep you happy and that’s what makes me happy. :))
30,Stayed here for five days last week. Check in was slow and unnecessary.    Others in our group were given rooms on higher floors without paying an upgrade fee.    The room was dated and the WiFi kept dropping. The bathroom could do with an update.    The buffet was excellent and well worth the money.    All the staff were very friendly and the hotel was clean.
30,We stayed at the Mirage for 3 nights. Upon Check in they asked us if we wanted an upgrade for 15$ for a city view window. Yeah sure sounds great right! Hmm but no it wasn’t worth it you could only see part of the city view and the windows were so dirty I couldn’t take a picture. So I think that is just one of their ways to make extra money off you.    The location is great! Super! You are right there in the center of it all can’t complain about that!    At nights it got very loud in the hallways people being very loud and the hotel room doors had like a 1 cm gap from the floor so you could hear so well we used blankets and pillows to try and block out the noise before going to bed. But even then the walls were pretty thin so you could here people talking from the other rooms.    I guess because this hotel is quite old that the walls are thin. But the rooms itself are quite modern.    checking out it cost about 200$ more for the resort fee and upgrade! Wasn’t too happy about that.    In all I wouldn’t stay here again. I would try a newer hotel but also in the area.
50,A great setup room we had.  Clean and well maintained room.  all things working well.  Lighting was well location. view WAS GREAT FROM THE ROOM    Friendly staff and eating places. No smoke smell. Casino was lively and happening also during the early part of the day...
40,My family and I were very pleased with the Mirage. We heard great things about this hotel and they were all correct. Our family will return to the Mirage the next time we visit Las Vegas. My 11 and 15 year old daughters really enjoyed the pool.
50,I've been coming to the Mirage for years and every stay has always been extremely positive. They are always competitively priced and the rooms are clean and the staff is always friendly. The sports book is one of my favorites on the strip and it is always a good time watching the games there.
40,Great views..relaxing huge pool..lots of food choices..great shows to choose from..many many slot machines and table games to play and win at...great location with awesome views..friendly staff and quiet rooms
50,After staying at a number of different hotels my wife and I always choose the Mirage for our trips to Las Vegas. It has a great central strip location and has high quality rooms casino restaurants pool area shops and staff. We have enjoyed our stays and have not had any issues.
50,a great experiece for my entire family hotel crew is just amazing lot of things to do many places just a walking distance first time and will be back sometime soon ask for Stay Well room at 12th floor so relaxing!
50,I feel at home! It is a place I have been coming to since 1990! Always such a welcoming trip. Pool is great! Casino is fun! Restaurants are delicious. Sports book fun! This is difinately my favorite hotel over all.
50,I had an issue with a pit boss at the Flamingo so went over to the Mirage.  I was greeted by Lois the pit boss and felt instantly welcome.  I will be sure to play here more on future trips to Vegas and I'll be looking to stay the the Mirage due to the friendly service.
50,We stayed in a one bedroom tower suite for four nights. Everything was great. Checked in online as soon as we walked in I received a message our room was ready. Went to self check in and got our keys fast and easy. Room was beautiful. Only complaint was it did have an old musty smell when you walked in but not overwhelming. We were on level A20 corner suite with strip view. We are once at the Pantry for dinner and it was very good and staff was delightful. Housekeeping staff was always nice and friendly in the hallways. We found everything clean. Pool area was lovely. Casino was nice again only complaint was it was a bit more smoky than other casinos. Needs to update there ventilation system.  We were aware of resort fees if you book directly then figure it in your price. We were also aware of the mini bar/snack prices. We just didn’t touch them....we did have a separate fridge in our suite to keep our own things cold. Over all we have a very nice stay and would definitely come back. The price for the suite was very reasonable. Loved the robes and slippers.
40,Been coming to Vegas for almost 30 years and it’s nice to have some of the old Vegas hotels still be relevant. They’ve kept up this property over the years and it’s still a cool place to stay. Huge pool comfortable rooms plethora of food choices and of course... lots of gambling.
50,I've stayed at Mirage more than 20 times. It is the easiest hotel to access if you're driving. It is located in the middle of the strip action with MANY restaurant and show choices within walking distance. The pool is wonderful. The sports book is awesome. Food choices are varied and high quality. The staff is friendly and when I've had a problem it has been taken care of quickly. Always a lot of fun. my adult children love it there also. We plan to return again and again.
30,Got a room using myvegas app and selected a king bed room. Then was told none were available when I arrived. I would expect this if I booked my room that night but I booked my room 2 months prior to arriving.
20,The Buffett was terrible took 4.5 hours after checking in at noon to get into the room. AC was either full blast cold or turned off thermostat wouldn't work. After a poor night of stuffy or freezing housekeeping just tried to walk in without knocking at 9. We won't be back.
40,This was my husbands first stay with Mirage. We decided to stay because we had points on our My Vegas App. We chose this property over Bellagio because we’ve never stayed here. We actually really enjoyed our stay and actually enjoyed the longer walk up and down the strip. Everyone was super friendly helped us when we needed it and the casino took about 75% if my budgeted money for the week. 😀
40,We enjoyed our stay at the Mirage. It was my first visit to Las Vegas and I was very happy with our stay. I did not give 5 stars as our view was not the best but we were seldom in the room and everything else was great.
50,Nice hotel and wanderful. I’m back this hotel soon. This hotel good location and nice staff. The pool very nice. I’m love it. This make me happy vacation on Las Vegas first times. Thank you so much. :)))))
50,Unfortunately my family and I had only booked 2 nights. What a regret this is an amazing hotel and casino and will definitely return.    The staff were very helpful rooms were so large clean and comfortable.
40,I enjoyed my stay as my conference was across at the venetian and it was very easy to go back and forth. I was in the Stay Well floor which has different lighting air freshners but i didn't really see how that was a value or did anything different for me. I did however had issues with the wifi and my cell phone receiption so that was a bit annoying.
20,Terrible room both our headboards were ripped very dirty carpet. Room not made up twice in our 7 day stay. No tea/coffee in rooms. No shower gel provided. Requested a Strip room but only got a side view of Trump tower. Will stay back at Venetian next time. Booked direct with hotel and ended up playing far more than Trip adviser prices. Good points ...nice pool and poolside restaurant.
50,The staff from beginning to end was always courteous and helpful. The room was always cleaned and never needed to ask for anything. The casino is also clean and well staffed. The Cravings buffet was excellent. Extremely well organized and clean food always hot and good. Beautiful Hotel. Highly recommend.
50,The Mirage pool is gorgeous. They have an area set off for 21 and over where you can rent cabanas and nicer lounges. The pool bar has really friendly staff and great drinks. The Love show was amazing. The rooms are nice and you can tell have been updated. We ate at 5 of the restaurants. The food was great at all 5. The service was excellent at each except for Carnegie Deli. The service there was terrible but the good was really good. Check-in and out were easy and every staff member was friendly. The gym was small but I never had any issues with using any equipment. The spa was really good. My husband enjoyed a massage and used the sauna and hot soaking tubs. The weather was great in March. Good time to go to enjoy outdoors without being scorched.
50,The hotel was very clean they were at full capacity and everything ran smoothly. They do a great job didn’t know it was at full capacity because everything ran so smooth. The hotel staff was excellent and the room was very clean. The only complaint would be smoking in the casino area but all the casinos allow it
40,Friendly staff early check-in available. Nice pool area. We were allowed to spend the day at the pool after checking out as we weren’t heading to the airport til 5pm which we appreciated. I would stay here again for sure.
50,We stay at the Mirage for the location the cleanliness of the hotel and the pool area. The service is always great and the food at the hotel is awesome. This is our go to hotel. Always love seeing the Beatles Love experience!
10,Well I made my reservations months in advance. This is an annual trip my friends and I take. However when we arrived on the evening of the first night we were told that you gave our room away and now we would be forced to use a King size bed instead of the two queens we requested. This put us in a very uncomfortable situation (asking us to share a bed). Thankfully the housing staff was able to find a roll away cot for us to utilize after we asked them.    Then the next morning when I called you were able to get us into the room we originally booked. The front desk assured us our keys would work at that room too. So we took the time to back up go over to the room only to find out the keys didn't work. When we called the front desk to alert them to the problem they said they would send somebody from security up to let us in right away. After waiting in the hallway of our room for over 40 minutes my friend walked down to the concierge got his key swapped came back up to the room we got unpacked AGAIN and then upon catching the elevator down we finally saw the security guard coming up nearly 65 minutes later.    I am beyond disappointed especially after our last trip to vegas we came to your steak house and were so impressed that we decided to stay here this year. I don't know if you were understaffed due to the NCAA tournament but I was terribly put off by the whole experience.    Your front desk did waive the resort fees for us for the amount of inconvenience I was thoroughly underwhelmed with the response. I certainly would have expected better from an MGM property.
40,Stayed here for 3 nights. It was a nice stay. Our room was clean and comfortable. The staff were friendly and polite. We didn't have much of a view from our room but we didn't pay for a room with a view so I can't complain. To be honest when you go to Vegas you don't go to spend time in your room do you?!  The pool area was really nice we enjoyed a day lazing in the sun. Expensive to eat and drink there though but again its Vegas!!    No complaints would defo stay here again.
40,Very nice family stay at the Mirage.  The location is good walking distance to everything and with a Walgreens across the road and Starbucks on site for easy coffee and nibbles.  Staff were at all times professional friendly and helpful. We had been delayed on the way in and after explaining that we weren't trying to check in early in the morning but late from the night before they were very helpful and got us organised ASAP.  We would normally stay elsewhere in Vegas and were concerned that this would be a step down but really enjoyed the atmosphere the good sized rooms and the good amenities.
50,Rooms were clean and well supplied cleaning staff very friendly the staff in all areas pool restaraunts casino front desk was very helpful and courteous thought food prices were fairly reasonable and quality was very good
50,"Mirage is in the center of all of the excitement and as a result it was feasible to walk to many of the other hotels and attractions on the strip! Being the home to the Secret Gardens and the Dolphin Habitat makes the Mirage a go-to hotel! The Beatles ""Love"" cirque d'soleil performance was absolutely amazing and a must see for everyone!!"
30,Our stay was average in every way. The room we waited four hours for was overlooking the tops of all the buildings. It had all the basics but it was definitely a no frills type room. The WiFi came as part of the stay (hotel fees) but only allowed two devices which didn’t allow me to hook up to phone and iPad along with my husbands devices. Our room was the furthest room down the hall which wasn’t bad for our step count but be careful if you have a problem walking. As for noise the room seemed quiet except when doors around you closed. Big slam! The housekeeping staff came daily and did a nice job. Overall good location in the center of the strip. Easy to get to most places. Definitely not a top pick if I were to return to Vegas.
10,Food was bad! Tv was broke in the room! Woken up to lady being escorted out at 5am that wasn’t a guest! The food in the buffet was absolutely terrible! The only good thing was the location on the strip
50,Loved our stay. Room was great the Beatles Love show was incredible. Restaurants were great. The Secret Garden was wonderful and we enjoyed the dolphins and other animals. All in all a great option for families visiting Las Vegas!
40,Lovely hotel. Spacious rooms with comfortable beds. Bathroom great but shower adjustment handle a bit loose so therefore hard to adjust. (Room 1031). Watch what you buy - I bought two bottles of water in one of the shops and was charged over 11 dollars! That is a lot for water.  If I was ever back in Vegas I would use this hotel again.
40,The Mirage is an older property but doesn't really show it's age. The service on all fronts was top notch and everyone truly appeared to be happy to see us. We stayed in a standard king room which happily overlooked the strip and the volcano. The room was well appointed and quite spacious. There is ample storage but I was disappointed on a couple of features. The safe is installed vertically on the wall so if you have a computer or tablet you want to store you must be very careful when opening it. My suggestion is don't bother. All we used it for was our wallets and that is realistically all I would recommend. The other issue is the included fridge which will not allow you to utilize it for personal items. The bathroom although rather small is sufficient and all facilities worked well. There is plenty of storage available for personal items. All in all if you want to stay at that end of the Strip I think you would not go wrong with the Mirage.
30,you have to pay $15 a day to park in garage. $40 a day for resort fees. Will NOT accommodate a room with an empty fridge and will charge $35 a day for one. They don't have heated pools. They were freezing.
50,We stayed here for a week when checking in and out the staff were friendly and helpful. The room was lovely and big two lovely comfy beds also very clean. The pool area there are plenty of comfortable sunbeds. Absolutely love this hotel and would definitely stay again
50,The hotel is beautiful the staff are more than friendly and the food is great. 21+ pool is a must with the amount of kids in Vegas. The mirage did not have that many kids as many other hotels which I very much appreciated.
50,Everything was great - the service the room especially the Beatles show LOVE!!! We arrived early but we were able to get into our room and the guy was so nice about it. The room felt so clean and the bed was comfy. It was nice to stay right where LOVE was and LOVE is the greatest show ever - we've gone 4 times!
30,We stayed at the Mirage at the end of March 2019. The pool is gorgeous and there are plenty of comfortable chairs to lounge on. The beach bar was fun to visit and the bartenders were fun and friendly. We were able to upgrade to a penthouse suite and although the room was gorgeous it was quite dirty and had an odour in the bedroom like urine. We chose to pay extra to check out late at 3 and house keeping started calling at 10 to 3 and every 3 or 4 mins after that to push us out of the room. The room was quite pricey so I’m sure they wanted it ready for someone else but I found this extremely rude. Like I said I love the pool but am not sure I would stay at The Mirage again.
30,The hotel and amenities are nice. The spa was enjoyable and the room was clean. The downfall is all the extra fees for parking resort fees if you need a fridge extra daily fee. They have an highly overpriced mini bar in the room. Beware: Do not touch or move a bottle in it or it will charge you as it is computerized.
40,Such an amazing vacation we spent thanks to the staff at The Mirage. Only wish they provided a microwave and coffee in the room for more of a convenience to the guest that probably are enjoying their room wayyy to much. Other than those minor things it’s an amazing place hands down.
40,Room was ok. Great service provided with great locations. Need to improve on cleaning bathroom. Also it was time for carpet to get shampoo. Shower had some issue and probably should have been replaced. Great location and service is great.
40,The location of the Mirage was perfect. It was in the middle of the strip so we could walk everywhere we wanted to go. The pool was a beautiful oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the strip. The rooms were nice and clean but nothing spectacular. The bathroom needed to be updated.
50,My stay at the Mirage was excellent. The room was clean. The location is central from everything on the strip. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The variety of restaurants was excellent. We ate at two and the food was plentiful and great tasting. The buffet had a variety and was tasty also. Will definitely recommend to my friends
50,At the airport I realized I left passport in safe. Buzzed back in a cab and security promptly helped me get back to the room and retrieve items. Still made my flight no problem! Two room C level suite did have a lot of elevator shaft noise but was remodeled and comfy.
50,I have been staying at The Mirage for more than a decade now! First took my oldest daughter when she turned 21 because she had always wanted to be a vulkanologist growing up! It turned out to be an exceptional experience and have returned continuously ever since. Have returned at least annually because my dad lives in Vegas (but stay at The Mirage) Took my twin daughters 4 years after for their 21st! Yes My father lives in Vegas but we still choose Mirage over staying with him because of its location and fabulous time every time!
50,The location of the hotel was great and the rooms were very spacious. When we checked in we were notified that they only had a 2 queen bedroom after we had booked a king bed however staff was very helpful and kept looking for a king bedroom which they found !!! made our stay very comfortable!!
50,We checked in at 2:30pm. Line wasn’t long and the room was clean and spacious. I love that the towels were very soft. A pleasant stay as we have stayed at many hotels on the strip. Would recommend since it’s in middle of the strip!
40,Parking is expensive. Surprisingly hard to get beverage service. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Staff is generally friendly but not always attentive. Ordered a pizza through room service received a $30 Digiorno frozen pizza.
30,First time at Mirage. Fntastic pool great spa nice shopping restaurants and public spaces (including casino). Four night stay.... But our room was dirty penthouse. And taking to a few other guests their rooms not very clean as well. Thrice down to guest services to little avail- obviously see the attached picture. Two managers and head of housekeeping. Whole room needs to be scrubbed down top to bottom. Not just a sheet change and vacuuming. Son has allergies and sick when inside. I attribute it to the room and perhaps the property in general.... Platinum MGM card. Will not stay at the Mirage property again.
40,We had four rooms booked for the week - gambled on property a little bit and ate a late dinner one night. Overall a very functional clean and reasonably priced place to stay for a trip to Las Vegas.
50,"Just returned from a 4 night stay in a Resort Tower King Room on the 25th floor with a view of the beautiful pool area the strip and the mountains. The Mirage is now 30 years old and is looking great for it's age. The common areas are spotless. The staff from Dave at the Front Desk to the maid to everyone we encountered during our stay were all very professional and helpful.    The resort tower king has a few plus's. Larger bathroom with 2 sinks separate shower from tub and elevators that only stop on the 24th and 25th floors. I'd give this particular type room a 9 out of 10. Age is starting to show just a bit and it might be time for a carpet change. The mattress was good but we have had better. Cosmo still has the best beds. There are technology hook-ups and wall to wall windows. There is a safe and lots of channels on the wallmount tv. We found the room very quiet but we were towards the end of the long hallway in the west wing.    The Casino is well laid out and has a really good variety of old and new machines. Something for everyone. We were not really bothered by cigarette smoke. Been in much worse casinos for smoking. Found the slot machines gave you a fighting chance to play and gave better payouts than Caesars Properties do.    Restaurants that we used were great. The Pantry was over the top expensive at $50 for 2 for a basic breakfast and because their cream was kept ice cold you could never get your coffee hot enough unless you drank it black. Loved that the coffee pot and every item you would want was on the table prior to being seated. LV Burger has the best burger I have ever eaten. Huge and cooked to perfection. Breakfast Buffet was good value at $19 and included unlimited beer wine and mimosa's and a really nice gentleman that prepared your eggs or omelette's to your taste. Could use a different breakfast potato option.    The pool is huge and makes you feel like you are in the Caribbean. The deck area can get crowded and could use some expanding. The Hot Tub should be re-named the Warm-Tub and because it was March Break was filled with kids all week. Kids should not be allowed in the Hot-Tub and the temperature needs to be turned up!! The other Hot-Tub was the same temperature but was closed for maintenance. It's possible the closed hot tub is for adults only. There is a separate adult only pool area. Nothing special and they charge $35 per chair to use it. Found this a bit of a gouge. When the main pool during March break has so many kids they should open up the Adult pool free of charge.    The 2 main shows ""Love"" and ""Terry Fator"" are 10 out of 10. Amazing. The cast of Love are incredible and the sound and tribute to the Beatles was unbelievable.    Overall a terrific classic hotel that has great atmosphere central location staff and ease to get around. There are things you can complain about but the good far outweighs the bad."
40,My wife and I just returned from a stay at Mirage where we last stayed 5 years ago. We have stayed at the Mirage now five times over the last 10 years.    Despite being one of the first mega-resorts Mirage has been able to remain a strong and relevant mid-tier hotel. The hotel has always offered great dining options and over the last year or two has added some new restaurants a coffee shop and a nice sports bar. Best of all in my opinion they recently opened a new centrally located bar and lounge in the center of the action which is something this property always lacked. The hotel is in a great center strip location with easy walks to many surrounding hotels. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful.    The downside to Mirage in my opinion is their rooms. Although they were renovated some years ago and are still decent for a mid-tier property they are starting to show their age. The rooms also lack nice floor to ceiling windows like you get with many of the newer and higher end properties. The doors are very thin and you get a lot of noise from the hallways. The biggest sore spot however is their bathrooms. Mirage unfortunately will probably always be stuck with some of the smallest and most cramped bathrooms of any of the better hotels. It is difficult for two people to fit in the bathroom at one time and getting into the shower past the toilet and bathroom door takes some navigating and is cumbersome.    Aside from the small bathroom and rooms that are showing some wear and tear the property as a whole is a great overall option for anyone looking for a classic Vegas experience at a strip hotel. I have no doubt we will at some point stay there again.
30,I recently stayed at the Mirage and it just ok. I like to check out different hotels along the strip and liked the proximity of this hotel to Fashion Show Mall. The biggest annoyance came from the smoky casino. Hailing from California where public smoking is essentially outlawed it was a shock to the system walking through the casino to get anywhere but I suppose that’s to be expected.    Upon check in the front desk staff was great. I’d previously reserved a strip view room and that’s exactly what I got. I was able to see the volcano show at street level; it was pretty loud even 17 stories up but didn’t last long at all.    The room too was just ok but pretty modern. Every time I encountered housekeeping in the halls they were pretty friendly. I did feel like the room was too stuffy; there was no way to get fresh air in which would’ve been nice.    I checked out the pool area which was pretty decent but too cold to lay out and tan.    I ate breakfast at the pantry one morning and it was pretty good! Huge portions too; I could’ve easily shared my plate with someone else. I wanted to try LVB Burger the sports bar and Stack but didn’t have the opportunity to do so. Of course there’s a Starbucks onsite which was convenient. The food and beverage credit was cool. I used those mostly at the Mandalay Bay one night.    I still believe the best standard room on the strip is a suite at the Delano; bigger than average standard room sizes at competitive rates no smoky casino to walk through (for the most part) but its location sucks. There’s nothing happening at the south end of the strip. Maybe that’s why it’s so cheap to stay there ha but I’d recommend that hotel before the Mirage.
50,Love the mirage it’s a great location and always a fun time! We always have enjoyed ourselves here it was a busy weekend but the wait time for restaurants were reasonable and we were able to belly up at the table games easily! Thank you for a great experience!
50,We wanted to get away but are really not beach people. We love Vegas and decided to stay at Mirage. What a great place! Very welcoming with plenty to do and eas if getting around. Great signage and excellent staff from top to bottom
10,Don’t go here until they make corrective actions against one of their staff member who treated me badly at one of their attaction. I already filed a complaint because of rude behavior. Hopefully they can take this seriously as people will start going somewhere else because of non-hospitable staff members.
40,We were a bit worried about staying in the Mirage after reading lots of reviews after I had booked it but we were very surprised as the hotel was nice inside and out. Room was very nice and clean. Swimming pool lovely with beautiful scenery. Great location on the strip within easy travelling distance to the north or south. Buffet breakfast was good with lots of choices ......Cost for breakfast was just over $20 per person. We took a helicopter ride over the Grand Canyon.....amazing experience. We also went to see the Beatles Love show.....amazing both were booked through the discount ticket place at McDonalds just accross the road from thr Mirage.
10,I recently traveled with my family to Las Vegas for a Cher concert. We made the mistake of staying at the Mirage because it supposedly has the best pool in Vegas. Coming from California where you can't smoke in almost all public places it was a shock to walk into a cloud of cigarette smoke in the lobby of the Mirage. The smell of cigarettes and fruity air freshener permeated the entire building—indoors and out. The walls are like paper you can hear every noise from adjacent rooms. To toilets sound like jet engines when flushing and the shower had barely any water pressure. The bathroom was dingy and old-fashioned. We were awakened numerous times in the middle of the night by drunken revelers. This was not the fault of the hotel but some insulation and sound proofing would help.    Overall the Mirage seems like if it was ever elegant and luxurious those days are long gone. If you are traveling with children I would recommend that you not stay at the Mirage because the whole place feels like a giant frat party. It is not an appropriate scene for kids. And that famous pool? It's cold the air is smoke-filled and there is no escape from thunderous really bad pop music.
30,My husband and I got engaged at this hotel several years ago so we were excited about actually staying here for our next trip. The room was smaller than expected but still fairly nice and comfortable. One of the downfalls was that for the first few daysthe shower wouldn't get hotonly lukewarm at best. Besides the lukewarm shower don't expect to buy food or beverages and keep it in the refrigerator...not without a price anyway. They actually charge guests for use of the in-room fridge. We couldn't believe it. The buffet was good though. There was lots to choose from and it also includes beer and wine on weekdays.
50,Perfect location on the strip . Deuce bus pickup close for either north or south bound on the strip. . Friendly awesome staff. Beatles Love show is the best 👍 Enterainment abound within walking distance.
40,Loved the mirage. Beautiful scenery. Loved the pool area Don’t eat at buffet total let down. go to one of the restaurants instead. The mirage is in a great place! Right beside Cesar’s palace and across from casino royale
50,We love the Mirage because of the great staff nice collection of restaurants and shops and excellent location on the strip with easy access to the strip and a crosswalk just feet away from the side exit.
40,"I was happy with my stay here. We came for a girls' trip on a long holiday weekend and had a great time. The hallways are looooooooong but I suppose that's expected with the layout of the building. While it's an ""older"" hotel by age they've done a good job of keeping it updated and refreshed. The rooms are quite spacious and seem to have been updated recently. The staff was friendly and very attentive (like when we asked for extra lotions or a pair of hotel slippers etc.). It was a nice touch that they had a fireplace ""crackling"" when we got into the room. Also the toiletries smell like CKOne - take that how you may. The water pressure was good but the drainage on the bathtub was quite slow with water backed up. That was less than ideal but fixed with a call to maintenance.    The location cannot be beat since it's right in the middle of everything on the Strip. We walked to the next property (Treasure Island/TI) to watch ""Mystere"" and walked in the other direction to Caesar's to check out the shops and go to the Bacchanal buffet (which is SO GOOD SERIOUSLY OMG).    The room service was responsive and is actually from the restaurant down at the casino level in case you don't want to wait in the looooong breakfast/brunch line. The Starbucks was insanely busy (and also not a ""corporate"" Sbux so they wouldn't redeem points etc.). We walked next door to Caesar's which had mobile ordering and no wait.    The casino itself at the Mirage is great. I liked the layout and it felt pretty open and not cramped. We had a ton of fun and there were plenty of people around at all hours. Like literally all hours. We were playing craps and roulette at 4am so that was definitely an experience. They have $10 craps tables too so score.    Overall I was happy with this stay and the room and property were very nice."
50,The Mirage offers everything a person or group could ask for while vacationing in Las Vegas. Clean rooms great food friendly staff various entertainment options and a tremendous amount of gaming selections. I recommend the Mirage to everyone (5 stars).
50,My trip was for the purpose of both business and pleasure and I selected the property based on the best MLife offer and a well equiped fitness center. With the property being at the center of The Strip it was very easy to take a short walk to experience other eating opotions.
50,top notch hotel excellent restaurants and shops. stayed here recently for a business trip and I cannot say enough about how wonderful the hotel and staff were. the pool area was great. hot tub was relaxing. gym was small but clean and served the purpose. plenty of good food and great entertainment. easy access to the strip if you choose to leave the hotel. great experience all the way around.
50,Amazing location Friendly/knowledgeable staff delicious buffett excellent accomodations. Have stayed in many locations on the strip and this will be my new Go-To. Friends staying in same resort also had same comments!
50,From the beginning to the end of our stay we never had any problem. Great customer service the rooms are always clean nice and comfortable. We stayed here more than once and they always treat us great.
40,The Mirage is a very nice hotel to stay in. The staff seems to care about your experience and that says a lot about a company. I didn't have any issues with my stay. Everything worked in my room and I was able to have a good night sleep during this trip.
10,Poor rooms. Small outdated. Needs reno.  Not worth your money. Too far on the strip. Not a lot of restaurants. We were always leaving the resort to find something. Secret garden not included in hotel resort fees. Not sure what you are paying resort fees for if you want access hotel services without paying. I wouldn't stay here again.
20,Very long check in process. Rooms not cleaned until 6:30 in the evening. People were friendly but over taxed. Our King was not available. They gave us an Accessible room. The toilet in the bathroom need 2 to 3 flushes to work. The shower was probably clean but very stained and dis-colored.
30,The rooms are average and need to be updated hopefully if I revisit I'll ask to stay in a more updated area of the hotel. Its not the same Mirage I remember when I stayed here a few years ago but it wouldn't take much to make this a great hotel again!
30,Visited for a conference first contact they gave away our Queen too we had already paid for. They were going to give us a King that doesn’t work for 4 people. With a little discussion and a managers approval we got a Queen room. I did expect that in spending over $300 a night it would be nicer. The chairs were worn and each head board had rips in them. We had an issue with housekeeping they did resolve that quickly and were very nice. I didn’t like the tracking on the mini bar our grandson move one item and they were going to charge for it until we had a discussion and it was resolved. We did like the family friendly pool. Overall nice but a disappointment!
20,Shower door was broken so water would get all over the floor bathroom has a weird smell and they skipped cleaning our room one of the days. Called front desk and she didn’t seem to care and issues weren’t addressed. Room service delvered food with no silverware and we had to call them. By the time they showed up food was cold. I did the kiosk check in and the machine wasn’t working and had to wait for help. I would been better off checking in through the line. We’ve stayed here for years and this was a very disappointing experience. We will try somewhere different next time.
50,First time staying at the Mirage and everything was wonderful. Hotel staff were all amazing. The hotel was right in the middle of the strip so it was a great location to see everything. We will be back. Thanks so much for a wonderful time.
40,Check in was smooth and efficient. That's impressive given how many guests come through this hotel.    The room was basic but comfortable.    The hotel is located right in the heart of the strip.    The pool area is huge but still very crowded.    If you are looking for good mid-range place that won't break the bank the Mirage is a great option.
50,This was my 4th trip to Vegas and my mates and I decided to try the Mirage for the 1st time. My worries this might not live up to previous visits were unfounded. Despite being less expensive than the other hotels i've experienced the facilities were equally as good! From first check in to departure the whole experience was great! I will definitely be staying there again!
30,We stayed at the Mirage. The grounds are beautiful. There is a strong chlorine smell when you enter the hotel. Checkin lines are too long. There is a Siegfried and Roy garden with dolphins and lions on the property which is a must to see. The food in restaurants is  way too expensive. I went on business so not an issue but I wouldn't otherwise buy meals there
30,We were shipped over to the Mirage because the MGM Grand was over booked (please see my MGM review on that).  The Mirage was a nice clean comfortable hotel and about average for a major hotel on the strip. Due to us being shipped over from the MGM (where we paid for a single King room) the Mirage only had 2 queen rooms left and would not upgrade us to a higher level room with a king bed. Check in was quick at least and the staff very nice.
20,Bathroom toilet didn’t work had to have maintenance come twice to replace parts and it still worked only half the time. The LED mirror in our bathroom was only half lit making the bathroom very dark. The water from the sink was either ice cold or scolding hot with no possibility for “warm” water by keeping both handles turned. The shower curtain had mold on the inside liner. I complained twice and was told maid service would replace it while we were gone during the day- this never happened. I’ve been staying here for 10 years and during my last two stays it has gotten worse and worse.
50,Overall the accommodations for the conference were excellent. I just did not realize that the rooms overlooking the volcano were okay but next time I should overlook the pools. That way I can possibly crack open a window.
20,Classed as a 4 star we were dissapointed to find even as guests we have to pay parking $15 per day. We get to our room. No coffee or tea no shower gel old bathroom and nothing that makes it stand out. Not even complmentary water. In our cupboard we find food and drinks left by the previous guests. Nice of them but shows that cleaning and checking is lax. Overall an experience we wont repeat and wont return here again.
40,We've stayed at the mirage approximately 6 times over the past 7 years. It was our very favorite until this time. The rooms are really starting to show their age. Power kept kicking off in the bathroom would have to reset via the outlet. Only found one outlet near the bathroom that had enough power to run the blow dryer. Ventilation is poor in the casino. Love the pool love the enhancements they've made to it. Love their entertainment and food options. Love the ease of check in and check out.
50,"I specifically visited Las Vegas during March 14 2019 thru March 17 2019 to attend a Celine Dion performance and decided to stay at the Mirage. My choice of the Mirage was based on a previous stay 3 years ago and on tripadvisor reviews as well as the daily rates. Upon arrival at the Mirage the bell hop greeted me with a friendly hello and asked if I needed assistance in a non-imposing way and upon my request proceeded to store my luggage until I checked in at the registration desk. After I checked in I called the bell hop service from my room and the representative was at my door in less than 10 minutes and proceeded to take out the luggage rack from the closet and put my luggage on top of the rack went and brought ice back to my room and showed me how the various settings for the purifying system worked in my room (exceptional customer service). Upon check-in at the front desk the receptionist was extremely pleasant and personable. I proceeded to ask about the STAYWELL rooms and decided to upgrade to this type of room. Also I asked for a late check-out for Sunday since I had a late evening flight home and the receptionist asked how late I wanted to check-out and gave me the options of checking out at 12 Noon at no cost 3:00 pm for $50 or at 6:00 pm for $99.00 and I choose the later check-out. I think it is a nice feature that the Mirage gives you choices for late check-out without having to pay for a full night’s stay (Great Customer Service).    As for the STAYWELL room I would recommend this type of room to everyone. First the room has an air purifying system that removes dust and pollen and for someone like me that suffers with sinus/allergy problems...I did not wake up congested and had as good a night sleep as I do at home (air purifying system at home). Also the shower is the best it has a Vitamin C Shower Head that dispenses Vitamin C every 30 seconds...talk about softer skin and hair and a pleasant aroma...I just ordered this type of shower head for my two showers at home. There is also an Aromatherapy diffuser that has a very subtle scent and the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable.    Additionally the housekeeping staff maintained my room with exceptional detail to cleanliness gave extra towels upon request and every day when I left my room and they were in the hall they greeted me with a ""Have A Nice Day and Do You Need Anything"" (Great Customer Service).    I will most definitely be staying at the Mirage during my next visit in June 2019 for a 4 night stay."
30,First time in Vegas. Big hotel property was clean and maintained. Seems older. Staff was friendly. Everything costs so bring your own snacks and water. Beds were okay. Location is good easy self park
20,Oh where to start rooms were not clean or well kept. Same bottle cap was on the floor in the hallway all week. Service was mediocre at best and the onsite restaurants that we tried were less than spectacular. Only good parts of this place would be Terry Fator and the Carnegie Deli.
10,I have been there many times before but this was the worst. I paid $1300 for 3 nights in a dump. Had problems with Express Check in. Requested the safe to be fixed 4 times an it was never fixed. No robe either
30,This hotel is very nice and clean. Well maintained. The location is good and the staff are very nice. They will nickel and dime you every possible chance they get starting with a $42 a day resort fee that is not included in any prepaid packages. The internet is slow and kicks you off constantly. The water pressure is low and there are no handheld shower heads. No microwaves in rooms. No Coffee makers. They charge you $50 a day to USE the fridge (not counting anything in it) Make sure that the tram is actually working as that is one of the reasons we chose this place and it was closed the whole time so we had to walk EVERYWHERE or Uber. Every restaurant and shop are astronomically priced. $6 for a Red Bull $40 for a PINT of Grey Goose $17 for a cheeseburger WITHOUT fries. Go across the street to Denny's or Walgreen's or one of the restaurants for a better deal.
50,Stayed with kids ages 17 and 13. Very appropriate for kids and they loved the pool. Kids enjoyed the secret garden. I enjoyed the casino and the hotel was very clean. Just needs a little updating in the rooms. Looking forward to our next stay!
30,The room was the worst part. Called four times to get toilet fixed and still never got fixed. Staff and everyone was very friendly and helpful with our questions. Was also a great location on the strip. On the north side with many great walking spots.
30,There’s nothing special here. It’s clean it’s neat and the service is good. They give you what you expect - nothing else. I thought it was ridiculous that the refrigerator was locked and to use it we’d need to leave a $400 deposit.
20,Service and meals for the convention were not what I expected - nothing special and even lacking. Response to food allergy requests were looked down on and even ignored until reminded several times and then leftovers from breakfast were served.
40,Stayed here for 5 nights.    Staff were very helpful and polite rooms spotless and big.  Unfortunately we had a terrible view - rooftop and air conditioner below facing a brick wall but i’m Sure they would have changed us if we asked but as we were only in our room to sleep as we were out sightseeing all day we didn’t worry about it. Would ask for a higher floor if we stayed here again.  All the restaurants have great food but like all food in the USA it is quite expensive. Averaged about $100 AUD to $150 AUD per meal for 2 people.  The fire display out the front of the hotel is on at 8 9 and 10pm nightly and would recommend seeing it from the street side rather than the hotel side.    Would definitely stay here again.
30,fourth time stayed at Mirage rooms always nice. receptionist at check-in was extremely pleasant and gracious housekeeping outstanding and friendly. had fun in casino but when there was couple obvious mishaps at black jack table of course the customer was always wrong even though asked for Management. So disappointed when the dealer obviously did not deal out cards to all players with chips already placed out (dealer was glancing around and not at table) should of been a misdeal but made customers without cards remove their chips to continue with what was played. not feel correct. then when friend hit 20 with dealer's 20 lady again glancing around grabbed all cards and did not 'match' with friend but took her money. called her out on that as well with management but their word from ours. won't play black jack there again due to this 1 woman dealer.
40,The atmosphere was great volcano show was cool did not get asked if I wanted a drink while gambling and was asked aggressively to show a room key by the security guard when heading to the elevators. Other than that I would say this place is a very nice hotel/casino and I would stay again if it was convenient.
40,Staff are 5 star--from the front desk to the bell hops to the room service and maids everyone was very cheery timely and accomodating. Room was fine/nice but great for the money. I came for a convention at the Venetian and it was by far the best priced hotel in the area. Saw Beatles Love there as well which was great. I joined MLife to save money. Since this is an MGM property I will definitely stay again.
50,Mirage in March. Awesome location! Great price!  Located directly across street from Venetian on main strip. Bellagio and fountains to your right. Good casino with less expensive table minimums than other casinos. Tons of fun and reasonably priced.
50,Rooms were clean and housekeeping staff are extremely pleasant and caring. Pool area is always awesome. Central. Only issue was the bar service staff at the casino appear to be protected by a union as their attitude was sad and service worse. You could tell they didn't care if you were pleased or not........They needed to meet their housekeeping counterparts who wished every guest a pleasant stay......... I will still return as the rest of the Mirage staff were outstanding........ Great value for the money!
50,Our total experience could not have been any better-from the food-wait staff-maid service overall cleanliness of the room and the resort. This was our second trip to the Mirage and we will continue to frequent the Mirage.
40,I am a fan of low minimum wagers and good deli sandwiches. The Mirage has both. The rooms aren't grandiose but they are nice. The bed was comfortable but not like sleeping on a cloud. I didn't like the smoke around the blackjack tables but that could happen anywhere. Yes I will stay there again.
40,"My wife booked and my buddies wife booked the trip for the 4 of us as a surprise 60th for myself and my buddy. We got in late from Toronto got lost trying to find our luggage and therefore delayed but not the only ones to have that happen as there were probably 20 other people like us that ended up waiting for a transfer to another terminal. Mirage does not have a shuttle you need to take an Uber pretty cheap to do. So when we got there it was late there had to be 50 plus people maybe more in the line to register. Took forever and we were very tired. When we got there the girls had booked the rooms in August we were told that they did not have any adjoining rooms they wont reserve those. So they put us one room between us and waived the ""room Fee"" $35 US an night that there is that they charge you at the Hotel like apparently all the hotels do. Its not included in your booking but will charge you when you get there. The room itself was awesome well equipped. DO NOT TOUCH THE MINI BAR! Water was something like $15 a bottle! Everything else was great. Do tour the other hotels do go to Fremont Street do take the bus pass for your trip. Much cheaper. Do check out the Mirage Volcano show do also check out the Fountain at Bellagio as well."
50,Excellent service in all areas of the hotel and casino. We thought the food and service in the restaurants was very good. The food at the buffet was above average but still a little lacking compared to some other buffets in Las Vegas.
50,My husband and I just stayed their last week from 03/14 to 03/18. What an amazing stay we had. The staff was super friendly hotel was gorgeous atmosphere was awesome. Not to mention the room we had overlooked the strip and the Mirage Volcano. Everyday was a new experience. We were there during open season for the pool and it was great. We were actually tempted to miss our flight on purpose to stay longer. We are also Military and we were treated amazing. Great discounts throughout the property for military not to mention our M Life discounts. We were so happy with our stay we are coming back in June and August. Thank you so much!!! We will be back soon!!! =)
50,The Mirage is a beautiful hotel perfectly positioned in the middle of the strip. The staff are helpful and polite the food at all the restaurants is amazing and the shopping is just enough. Gambling is enough to keep you playing.
50,There's certain standard you expect when you stay at the Mirage and they have managed to maintain it after all these years. Excellent rooms excellent service and the property has always felt secure and well managed. If you've ever stayed there you know the location is hard to beat with its easy walking access to the center of the strip and parking in the garage area is easy to access via Spring Mountain Rd.
50,i. can’t compare vagas to any other place I have visited . It can overwhelm you. Everything seems close enough to walk to but even the next hotel can take a few minutes.so a hotel that looks close can take 20 -30 minutes.vagas has more to offer than just gambling the shows are awesome the welcome huge and I found all the Americans I met very friendly . try local beer and food instead of the same things you have at home. A trip to Fremont street is highly recommend (old vagas) and if you’re budget alows a trip to the Grand Canyon (as a birthday treat my wife and I took a helicopter ride) amazing breathtaking.the Americans don’t do anything by half .loved it
30,Everything was ok just basic nothing special. Our greatest experience was dining at The Pantry. Definitely don't eat at the buffet The Craving. There was nothing there to crave. Food had been sitting out awhile. The front desk staff was ok; however at the Mlife desk I got about 4 different versions of how to use my express comps. There needs to be some retraining.
50,The location is great. I only wish that my room had a better view of Las Vegas. I wasn't aware that people could smoke in the building (I am a non-smoker) and that wasn't good for me. I will come again.
50,I often travel alone but it doesn’t mean that I like to be left completely alone. From check in to check out I encountered nothing but kind helpful people. (But never overbearing.) People said “hello” and “good morning” ...and they smiled!    Everything was easy and they don’t make navigating through the hotel feel like a chore. The parking garage was right next to the front desk as was the valet. I had received a comped room from playing MyVEGAS but never was I made to feel any less of a valued guest.    (The one bit of constructive criticism I have is that the bed should really have more or heavier blankets. I ended up sleeping with all my pillows on top of me because I was cold. Also my room faced Trump tower...but ANYWAYS!)    In addition as usual I appreciated the ambiance throughout the hotel. Don’t let anyone convince you that you should change! From the atrium to the pool to the lobby. I feel like I’m in a tropical location when I’m here. I never feel a need to wander elsewhere.    I have stayed at The Mirage more than any other place in Vegas and this visit was just another reminder as to why I continue to come back. MGM properties exceed my expectations every time! Thank you from your very happy guest. I will be wearing my Mirage socks and drinking wine in my Mirage wine glass (purchased from your gift shop) with pride!
50,Had another amazing stay at the Mirage was very fortunate and able to upgrade room upon check in so I had an amazing Penthouse view of the strip. Staff was extremely nice and helpful and finished off with great meal at Heritage Steakhouse.
50,This was my first trip to Vegas to celebrate my 50th Birthday at the Mirage. The entire staff were all extremely friendly and helpful my entire stay. Everything was very clean and smelled like Hawaiian Tropic suntan lotion. The pool experience was awesome and the mirage was littered with a variety of restaurants. The wife loved the pillows too...
50,Great people best service with a smile great view of the strip top restaurants and verity of foods and top entertainment all around. Spa amenities and personal are top of the line and a must visit.
50,Great facility including restaurants and casino. Comfortable room friendly staff. Great MLife Rewards program. Even the housekeepers and Bellmen were friendly. The Still Carnegies and Otoro restaurants were wonderful as was Lobby Bar (especially Miguel)
40,Was a fun girls weekend would have loved to be able to stay longer but couldn't. We will be back. Nice restaurants some reasonably priced others expensive but great food beautiful pool area pretty hotel. It had a great location Dolphin area is great to see and the baby was soooo cute.
50,We experienced awesome service starting with the gentleman I spoke with the night I booked the vacation over the phone. Everyone was so helpful and friendly to the last moment. The Mirage became the only place I will stay when my Children are with me in Las Vegas again! Thank you!
40,First time at The Mirage was a very good stay. I would appreciate a lower room rate but the staff for the most part was great and the dining options are delicious. This hotel & casino is centrally located on The Strip which was convenient.
50,My husband and I recently stayed at the Mirage for our 25th wedding anniversary. We were in a room that faced the volcano which was spectacular. We had a wonderful view of the strip. The hotel even offered to upgrade our room to a suite for the occasion but I really wanted the view of the strip. Our room was perfect. The concierge was very helpful in setting up my VIP tour of the Secret Garden and painting with a dolphin. The staff were all very friendly. I love the restaurants at the Mirage. The pool area is gorgeous—a little slice of paradise. Our stay was just perfect. The Mirage really made our 25th wedding anniversary perfect. I can’t wait to come back. Thank you!
50,The Mirage is my favorite Hotel and I've stayed at quite a few in Vegas. The size doesn't overpower like others and the rain forest theme with fresh flowers just makes me smile. The pillows got my attention so much that I had to order 2 of them.
50,As usual The Mirage did it all perfectly!    Very nice restaurants to choose from and the bars are quite nice. We prefer the High Limit Lounge because they have a friendly staff the music is good but not loud and the service is top notch!
40,Hotel was great as always. Bath fixtures could be updated. Food lines had a little wait but was worth it for the food they served. Spa was extremely relaxing and the staff was more then helpful. Great selection in the gym with multiple equipment choices.
30,First off I’d like to say that even if English wasn’t someone’s first language. The hotel representatives that are suppose to help the guests. Shouldn’t say that the guest doesn’t know how to speak any English or cannot be understood. “Stacey” and I believe “ Brittany” most definitely need to be re trained in the hospitality industry. I could feel Stacey’s eyes rolling over the phone and the other girl which I think was Britney who made the uneducated comment that whoever was on the phone couldn’t speak any English definitely needs to understand that even if the guest can not speak good English don’t belittle them and make such harsh comments. I was extremely offended. Even though English is not our first language. I have lived and worked in an English speaking country for over 35 years! and that was the first ever kind of comment I received that was uncalled for.  I tried to switch my room again this time due to the stains all over the curtains. We called down and that’s when the rudeness was just enough. “Luke” walked me down to the front and I was then helped by Bianca at the front desk. Total night and day on the treatment you get when your face to face. Apparently the helpline staff aren’t the ones that are at the help desk. Anyhow I did end up with an upgrade because of the lack of manners and ignorance from the other two staff members. Huge difference. To me just being friendly with the guests helps make ones stay a lot more enjoyable. Bianca calmed my already frazzled nerves and made the situation better. Mirage overall was a decent hotel. Very central. The Volcano show is a must watch. The stay well rooms are worth considering a second visit to this hotel. Also the dolphins and tigers are very well cared for there and I would recommend going to the habitat. Bottom line is don’t work in a hospitality field if you truly don’t want to accommodate guests let alone talk trash about them and they can hear you!
10,"Please accept my apologies. I stayed at the Mirage for 5 nights and Las Vegas for 6 days. I'm sorry so ""sorry."" After several nights I got thirsty. Please accept my apologies. I know not to tough any of the Mirage's so called ""goodies."" This is kind of like squeezing Dolly Parton. Pardon my part-on Dolly Parton!    In any case it was 3:00 a.m. and I was thirsty. I drank the bottle of water on the counter (not in the mini-bar - on the counter staring me in the face night after night.) Two nights later I drank another bottle of water - this time at 4:00 a.m. I checked out. Charge? $36 for the water. The desk clerk explained that each bottle of drinking water cost $18. Can you believe this place?    If nothing else if you decide to go to this piece of crap hotel don't gamble (I don't) and don't drink the water in the bottle on the counter unless you are willing to pay $18/bottle."
50,The hotel is huge and has nice stores with different areas that have restaurants shops casinos and conference facilities. Great volcano lighting in the evening spectacular. Lots of walking. A great place to explore and exercise.
40,Nice hotel. Great location mid service. We had some issues with our reservation despite our reservations in late August. The hotel manager said it is not uncommon to overbook and walk people to other places on the strip. Told them I was not happy with this and they found us a room and gave us a credit for the hotel fees. I would go back and stay at the mirage
30,I researched the Mirage. Their website tells you NOTHING. They have a required $300 charge to your credit card. Not on the site. No coffee in room. We had to get dressed and wait in an extremely long line to pay $5.00 or more for coffee. Not once but for every day we stayed. There is a charge for the Secret Garden and Dolphin visits. Again NOT on their website. Cleaning service did not replace all the towels used nor the soap used. WE had 4 couples checking in at the same time and all 4 were told different things by their desk clerk. Kind of glad we did not get our King bed we reserved  the other three couples' King beds were a joke! My husband and I slept in our own beds. Bathroom very small. No refrigerator to bring back leftovers or keep beverages. Basically the only thing you did in your hotel room was sleep and clean up. No relaxing unless you spent an hour getting your coffee first. I did not even get a complimentary drink while playing in the casino until the day we left. Don't bother with the M rewards unless you are a high roller. Waste of time standing in line for the card and then again trying to redeem your points! Don't plan on getting playing $ for your points. The pool was the only enjoyable experience. Plenty of chairs and great service.
50,"Great hotel in great location on the Strip. Good sized clean rooms friendly helpful staff. Ate in a couple of restaurants ""The pantry"" food not to badly priced but drinks expensive. Had a complementary breakfast buffet. The choice of food was unreal from roast beef to chinese to sushu or mexican and of course normal breakfast but would of been incredibly expensive if we were paying $30 each!!!"
10,This hotel is missing the mark in several areas. Prices in on-site restaurants are high for mediocre food & service. No prices on food items in on-site shops and found out at register bottled water is $6. Rooms are okay clean but overall worn looking. No coffee maker or courtesy bottles of water in rooms. Pillows are hard. Woken up by mysterious alarm at 4 am that speaks to tell you it is an early warning system for an issue that is being investigated and says more information will follow. However no information followed and when calling front desk to get more information received attitude rather than empathy about the stress the alarm caused.
50,I was traveling for work and really enjoyed my stay at the Mirage. It was a lot less smokey-smelling than the other casino-hotels I visited. The location is great since it is right in the center of the Strip. The casino is big but not as overwhelming as others. Staff were friendly - I didn't have any bad encounters. My room was spacious and very comfortable!
10,Room was the real problem. Staff were fine. Hard to control temp in room no blankets no hot water/coffee high resort fees for nothing in return. Everything way over priced ($7 bottled water). Was not a very comfortable stay and was absolutely not worth the price.
50,This is my 2nd time staying at Mirage and on both occasions we were very well treated. Shopping is so convenient from Mirage and dining is fantastic..Casino area is very clean and the slot machine is very forgiving to a slot player like me.. and theres lots of option too theres no waiting in line to play a machine...
40,You can lose your bearings in this very large hotel but there are plenty of food choices great shops and the king room was huge! Very close to everything - was able to attend a number of shows. It was really easy and inexpensive to use an uber to get around.
20,"This was my first time staying at the Mirage and I will have to say that this will probably by my last. My wife and I stayed in a Resort King room on the 8th floor. First off I would like to know what my ""resort fee"" went towards. Basically nothing is included so I honestly don't know what that fee goes towards.    With regards to the room where do I begin? The room itself was lackluster and to be honest it was dirty. The room was filthy! There was dust pretty much everywhere and trash left from a previous guest. Further the room itself was pretty bare bones. The bathroom was a huge disappointment. The shower head was rusty and was not fully attached to the wall the ceiling paint was coming off and the shower was tiny! The bathroom was also extremely small and could not even fit 2 people comfortably. The rooms at the Mirage desperately need a face lift.    Now we get to the dining. I will say Stack restaurant was absolutely delicious! This was the only saving grace for my stay. Cost Osteria was lackluster at best and don't get me started on the buffet. This is one of the worst buffet's I have been to period. Not just a hotel buffet but any type of buffet. I was worried I was going to get sick just being there.    Last when it comes to the casino there is a lot of improvement needed. I have been to many casinos but I have to say that the dealers at the Mirage are some of the worst I have ever seen. They are discourteous unfriendly and inconsistent.    All in all my experience with the Mirage was poor and would not recommend."
20,The rooms are not luxury by any means and often have issues. Smells are often present. Rooms are the equivalent of an average motel. The minibar is a trap they use to squeeze more money out of guests. The slightest touch apparently triggers charges even if nothing is removed. They charge a $50 restocking fee even when nothing is removed. Very petty policy. This is apparently representative of the company's overall approach to dealing with its guests: take then for every buck they can deception encouraged.
50,This is a second year in a row that we are staying at the Mirage. It is a wonderful hotel with very friendly helpful staff and lots of restaurants and big casino floor. Very close to most visited locations on the Vegas strip with so many choices for dining shopping and entertainment. Clean rooms and comfortable beds.
50,Nice time in Las Vegas! It is something that you don't see in another place. Although you can see the replica from Venetian Eiffel Tower they were good. My favorite was the Forum Romano in the Caesars Place.
20,Average food very few friendly staff/dealers. The facility casino bars and restaurants are dirty and too smoky. Everything is way too expensive. A Diet Coke in the gift shop is $5. They stick it to you at every turn. Terrible value. We won’t be back.
50,Had a wonderful stay over 3 days and never even got to everything that was available to guests. Great options for everyone...if a little pricey (of course its Vegas).    Would be nice to have an expanded Gym...but who goes to Vegas to work out? And the showers in the guest rooms could be upgraded for such a nice hotel.
10,We aited on a very long line to check-in. We were told that teh room with a king bed that we had reserved was not availble and we were offered a room with two queen beds. As an accomodation the resort fee would be waived. It as only waived for one night of our stay. The internet did not work for most of our time there. The room had a faulty air conditioner and the casino smelled from old carpeting poor ventialtion that was unsuccessfully being covered up by a vile vanilla smell.
10,"Management accused me of knowingly disregarding mini-bar/refrigerator ""rules"" (printed in fine print on the back of the door who sees that?) lying about it and then charged me $50 for storing a pizza I bought at their restaraunt in the frig in my room. WTH. Manager literally accused me of knowingly doing this and after nicely correcting her and explaining that somehow she had been misinformed she then accused me of lying about it. I hope the $50 is worth me never stepping foot in your casino again!"
30,I recommend waiting until the night before your arrival to pay for an early check in if you want it. It was $20 instead of the $40 I was charged when I booked the room. There is also a resort fee of $35 per night.
40,Enjoy my trip to the Mirage year after year. This trip I had to change rooms because of a leak and had my credit card used fraudulently. However the staff is always friendly and courteous. The gaming is fun. The cocktail waitresses remember me and what I like to drink. That's pretty remarkable.
20,Not clean room dirty smelled dirty everytime fan came in the room smelled of musty dirt. Window did not open so I could not even open the window to air things out. Best Western offers a cleaner room.
50,Clean professional and always a great time. The pool is one of the best on the strip. The sports book is a amazing . Plenty of tables games. 10$ tables ! Poker room very professional and always has been. Won’t regret. Mirage always keeps it professional and never lets the environment become unprofessional.
20,"This hotel is pretty low-class all the way around. I understand that room rates fluctuate a lot but during this particular stay I was paying more than $300 per night - which is just laughable considering the quality of the hotel and its services. (Also the mandatory ""resort fee"" of over $40 is the highest I've heard of. What does the resort fee cover? Internet pool and gym... the same things offered at every hotel on the Strip.)    The clock radio next to my bed was visibly broken and not functional. The shower head in the bath was broken and hanging off of the wall.    I ordered room service for breakfast and my meal was delivered without silverware. I called the restaurant immediately and explained that my food was getting cold...After being put on hold for several minutes I was ultimately told that my beverage would be taken off the bill. I said that the beverage was not the problem and that I thought a different discount would be appropriate. They said no that they would only comp the beverage.    There are a lot of hotels on the Las Vegas Strip and the Mirage should not be in one of the higher pricing tiers. It's pretty crummy overall."
40,5 nights in March on a VIP rate stip/volcano view. Room pleasant modern comfortable bed. Drapes fine for blackout. Connecting room (hate them) but not real sound from neighbors. Bath sixe features amenities just average for class. Stupid mini-bar makes frige unusable - requested real fridge told 'sure' at VIP check-in - none appeared. No coffee maker - VIP offers coffee downstairs vs. $6 cup at SBX. Convenient location confusing uber pick-up - North valet only / missed one because of that for $5 no show charge. For price a good value.
50,The Mirage is an example of a hotel that has understood and implemented customer service. I will stay there again because of how positive I felt about every aspect of this hotel/resort/casino (and this isn't because I won money at the casino :) )
50,slot tournament couldn't have had a better stay everything was great we have a fabulous time  the room was fantastic. what a great experience . We would do it again for sure. The host is always amazing taking care of us and making sure everything was ok.
40,Good size king room nice mountain view.  The curtains could be darker because of the roof lights shining in. Toilet needs to be quieter. Free weights area could have more room around it and remove some stationary equipment around it.    Room is clean and well kept.
50,This hotel was great and they had everything you needed! The restaurants entertainment and the casino were all perfect!! We would definitely stay at this hotel again without a doubt!! It is kid friendly as well as for just grown folks!
30,Stayed in March 2019. First placed on 9th floor. Very concerning floor tilting going on as if building was slanted. Asked to switch rooms but in the back of my head still wondering why? The front desk said it was a handicap room and I said “so someone in a wheelchair can role down their room even if they don’t want to”?
50,The Mirage is a great hotel for reasonably priced accommodation on the strip. Rooms are clean and a great experience for Vegas. The Otoro Robata Grill and Sushi offers exceptional food very reasonably priced - the Chilean sea bass is a definite dish to recommend. Staff friendly and hotel clean can’t ask for much more. Great stay overall.
50,The Mirage exceeded all expectations from Check In to Check Out. Not that I'm high maintenance but it's hard for me to not find something that bugged me about a hotel. The food was amazing too! Eat at Pantry you won't regret it. The burgers at LVB burger were so amazing and the drinks at The Still were perfect!    If you've got the opportunity to stay on the 12th floor (the Stay Well floor) then go for it. It's got some extra amenities that may seem unnecessary but it elevates the entire stay.    Terry Fator puts on a good show for the family (I didn't go but I heard amazing things from the other guests). I did go see Cirque de Solis - Beatles LOVE and it was phenomenal! 100% recommend it.    No matter what specifics you choose The Mirage won't disappoint. If you go and it does then you can come back and send me hate mail cause I'm vouching for them.    (I also liked that the hotel was on the north side of The Strip. I think the north side is much nicer than the south side but that's just my opinion).
20,The price point is too high for the quality of services received. The room had a strong unpleasant odor. The food was expensive and fair at best. Most of the staff was help but the staff that wasn't helpful really stood out.
50,I stayed at the Mirage with me and 2 of my friends. We had an experience of a Lifetime there and will never forget it. I ended up meeting a lot of fun people and can't wait to return back. This is an awesome hotel!
40,Hotel was nice I enjoyed the show and the animals at The Secret Garden. The pool was very pretty although we did not use it bc it was a little cool outside. My only complaint was the same as others can't use the fridge and no coffee maker. I read online you could call for a coffee maker but when I tried they said they don't have them at all. You would think with so many complaints about those 2 items they would change something.
40,Always a nice place to stay. Service is always nice and helpful. Convenient to anywhere on the main Strip. Just don't select Stay Well room. Not worth the extra money. Food selection is not the best but always consistent.
40,I was there for the NCURA Conference. The Hotel was good the service was good. My only problem is the smoking. It's terrible. Due to this I would probably stay somewhere else in the future. You cannot get to your room without having to go thru the casino.
10,"The most overwhelming experience at this hotel was the buffet. In face the hotel was okay for the money paid unhoovered carpets and un-mopped other areas in my bedroom and the RF was just the usual bare-faced cheek fee of around $40 a night for internet and other stuff one expects included and that won't be used. Utter rip off. This trip I have booked all NO RF rooms off strip and downtown to avoid these pure scamsters.    But really it's the buffet. I was profoundly disturbed; you've never seen such garbage in your life the sucker punches of cuts and cuts upon cuts to remove as many costs as possible has never been seen so clearly in the light of day. An absolute scandal.    There was nothing to enjoy. The fish section? Oh yes a big fish buffet area? Aptly named ""fish"". Nothing. One dried out slither charred to the pan about 1cm squared. Nothing filled up just left hour upon hour. It is just incredible what these people charge to go in here even at lunch it's sky high and for what? Nothing! I know lunch is the worst time to go but ye Gods!    There was one so-called curry dish on the Asian station I saw the ""chef"" (read as: warmeruperer) stirring in a few florets of brocolli. Then came and stirred a bit of this and that in. It had been there for hours. It was an amazing spectable to behold. There were deep fried economy generic and insipid carbs like spring rolls. Watery sauce. Incredible never known anything like it.    The other freezer food on the buffet was just an outrage. Don't forgert too that when you turn to drink - there's nothing to eat - you will get filthy looks if you don't tip for every glass poured. I knew this in advance so came as no shock but the state of the buffet now? It's just sooo funny. Unless you paid to go in nd then it's tears of sorrow.    Maybe 200 Vegas buffets over the years? By far and away the very worst and by absolute leaugues in distance. I am absolutely not be sarcastic when I say I think people should be arrested!    Scandalous operation what a mess the likes of MGM are making of my favourite second home. The nickel and diming here is phenomenal really and those resort fees for nothing nothing despite whatever they blabon about under our reviews absolutely nothing and they know it. Never will I step foot in this buffet for as long as I live and I warn you not to enter until Vaseline has been rigourously applied."
50,I had aGreat time and will Come Back!! I have invited my family while I was there I sent them pictures to let them know this is a place they don’t want to Miss. I had a lot of Fun!!Also there’s so much to do and to see. You come to see the dolphins there . The pools are Nice! If you come to Las Vegas you must come here.
40,The Mirage is about the same as it was in the 90’s. It may not have the wow factor but it worked well for me and my two teenaged boys as we did dinners shows and battlefield Vegas for two days. Clean and fair value....apparently a pet friendly hotel as first room we entered had a dog barking a lot and we bailed ASAP. Front desk moved us quickly and professionally. Fitness center was better than I thought also.
50,We have been staying at the Mirage for years and will not stop. The rooms are very clean and the housekeeping is very friendly and if you have needs they make sure it is done right away. When you check in even if it is before check in if they have a room ready they give it to you right away. We didn't meet a staff member that was not friendly and helpful.
50,Well located within walking distance of good restaurants shopping shows and more. Pleasant environment comfortable friendly staff. I've stayed at 2 other locations in Las Vegas and found this to be the most relaxed and comfortable.
40,Other than a less than desired check-in the property is very nice the casino while a bit dark is still welcoming. The meals I had on property while not exceptional were adequate. The sleeping rooms were well appointed. Please place coffee/tea maker in the rooms. Having to venture out to get a cup of tea in the morning was a bit irritating.
50,Everything was very nice and clean. Everyone we encounter from our check in to housekeeping were very attentive. The buffet was great unlimited beer and wine can’t go wrong with that. Volcano show amazon.
40,The Mirage is a clean beautiful hotel that is worth the price. Staff was helpful rooms clean nice casino. The rooms lacked a coffee maker and microwave I guess they want you out of the room and in the casino. It wasn't warm enough to swim but the outdoor pool looked very nice.
40,Room smelled like pot. Very responsive staff. Cleared air with a machine. Suite adjoining room was locked. Had to call service again. Cafe great food. Pool area is amazing and relaxing with friendly staff and servers.
40,"I came here for a conference and it was quite the experience. The location is great right off the strip. There are food options (although very expensive) and you can get a discount to the Beatles show in the hotel. It's smoky and very ""vegas-y"" but comfortable and the staff were friendly."
50,I love the mirage. We were supposed to enjoy the painting with the dolphins on a trip during Valentine's day. Unfortunately on the day there was a downpour. While they do not cancel the experiences unless there is lightening Cat at the concierge desk was more than accomadating un rebooking our tickets for a future trip out of our concerns over what the rain might do to the paint.    We look forward to staying at the Mirage in the near future and finally getting to paint with the dolphins.
40,The mirage location was great with a friendly price. Everything was convenient to get to and there were no issues with traveling. The staff was friendly and the food was decent. Tables also had good minimums.
40,The rooms have plenty of charging areas and a tech center on the table where you can connect hdmi cables that are already linked up to the tv and all sorts of connections. TV is easy to use and the beds are pretty comfortable. The staff is pleasant and would definitely recommend.
30,The bathroom's exhaust fan turned on made noise but wasn't really performing its intended function because either the exhaust duct was blocked or the vent louver was stuck in the closed position. A stinky/steamed-up bathroom ruined the ambiance of an otherwise nice-looking room.  Also the armrests on the office chair at the desk were falling off. The chair needed some Locktite and a missing bolt.
40,Stayed in a Resort Tower King Room in late February.    The advantages of the Tower over the regular rooms are twofold first dedicated elevators for the 24th and 25th floors. This means there is little to no wait for elevators and the trips are very quick. Even in the morning there were few people with luggage filling the elevators which can happen near check out time. Second the Resort Tower rooms have an upgraded bathroom with a separate tub and walk-in shower along with a double vanity sink.    The rooms themselves are nice but not the kind of over the top room some newer properties have. Plenty of storage space and a usable desk along with a small love seat sorta chair.    The views looking south are pretty good as you can see most of the way down the strip. I would argue that the best views are the ones looking south rather than the strip views. The views don't compare to the best in town but are still OK.    The bed is a little firm but comfortable.    The only negative for me was the lack of bathroom amenities. There were a total of tow bars of soap no bath soap or shower gel. They also provided shampoo conditioner and body lotion. The quality was OK but nothing special. The lack of shower gel or bath soap seems to be a corporate MGM issue since between my first and second stays at Delano they went from some of the best bath amenities to generic stuff quite similar to the offerings at Mirage.    Housekeeping was prompt and thorough with no issues of coming back to the room in the late afternoon and finding the room hadn't been services which has been an issue at other MGM properties.    With high end hotels the difference between a 3 4 and 5 star isn't the physical property but the experience. The people were great but little things like bath amenities just take a little off. I know it's a first world problem but isn't flying to Las Vegas and staying in an upgraded room at an iconic problem just about the most first wold thing you can do?
10,I spent two nights here at the end of a fabulous road trip visiting Utah and Arizona it's a pity the mirage can't take a leaf out of the holiday inn Sedona and best Western Grand canyon especially when it comes to customer service and value for money the mirage only want your money they don't care about you as a customerif so so much as put a finger on the mini bar it's touch sensitive and you are automatically charged!! I asked for a coffee machine gladly provided at the other hotels point blank refused Starbucks in the hotel wanted$5 to fill my reusable cup with hot water!! Yet the secret garden with dolphins and tigers refuse entry with any kind of plastic- bottles straws etc- an excellent idea to protect our oceans why is this not replicated in the hotel?? clearly they do not really Care about wildlife in just how much money they can makeif you like to be ripped off and don't care about customer service and have money to burn then stay here otherwise stay elsewhere.
50,The Miraage will be 29 in November and is carrying her years very well. Not too many signs of age and unfortunaltly what there is cannot be fixed. I have found the staff to be professional and friendly I appreciate being helped by people rather than computers and hope that they will continue to do so.I have reviewed this Hotel so many times that there is nothing new I can say. So this time I am going to talk about our dining experiences.  California Kitchen good service. Fast. My husband considers their Pizza the best and so we go there to eat first thing.  Thr Pantry good for Breakfast even though they have slimmed the menu down so much that some of our favorites were missing. But for Breakfast it is fine Dinner not so good. Poor service and I think that the good cooks had left. I would not recommend this place for dinner. However I would definitely recommend OSTERIA COSTA for dinner. The staff professional friendly and extremely hellpful. We had a great Waiter Lam who was extremely competant friendly and professional. Could not have asked for better service from any one here at this Restaurant. I ordered Lamb Chops and they were the best chops I have ever had. (I practically licked the plate clean) but in a restaurant you can't do that. Also much to my furprise the prices I thought were very reasonable especially for Las Vegas. I would definitely recommend this Restaurant to any one wanting fine dining in a non stuffy restaurant. The ambiance is open light and not too noisy so you can have a conversation with your fellow diner without screaming.
50,Stayed here for a conference. The staff was helpful the food was great and everything was conveniently located! Loved the bar in the pantry and when we ordered a drink and loved it so much the bartender came over and made it in front of us so that we could make it at home! Nice touch!
40,We have stayed at the Mirage several times and always have had a great experience. Rooms are well appointed and comfortable. Only issue was the WiFi connection was spotty and had to keep reconnecting - not a big deal but annoying. Front desk staff was great and very helpful.
20,I was stuck in the stairwell. I didn't see the little sign in the wall. Their security was not sympathetic at all!!! He thought I wasn't a guest and I found my room key on the floor!!!!! I was in my pjs looking for a working pop machines since the one on my floor was broken!!!! I was getting ready for bed and I forgot to take my medications. It was awful and scary!!!!!
50,My first trip to Vegas and it did not disappoint!    We got an uber from the aiport to the Mirage cost about 17$    Once there we had such a great time. Check in was busy and took a while but no problems.  The staff were so friendly and handed out water to people in the queue    The casino is amazing i smoke and like a drink so suited me down the the ground!    Out strip view king room was comfy spacious and the view was amazing.    We'd been prewarned about the very high mini bar prices so kept well away from the fridge.    Cleanliness was ok- not bad but not the best. Found some sweets by the side of the bed left by a previous guest.    We ate at the buffet twice both times the food was really nice.    Drinks served in the casino were great    All staff we dealt with were really friendly.    Would definitely come back!
40,The Mirage is in a great location with easy access to Shows and shopping. We were miffed at the fact that there was no coffee in the room. It has been years since I stayed anywhere that your first cup o joe wasn’t furnished in the room. Very annoying to have to get dressed and go down 20 floors and stand in line 20-30 minutes to get coffee.
10,Brought my family to Vegas to see a show and upon arrival was told our penthouse suite was overbooked and not available. Reservation was made months in advance and they took a full deposit. The gentlemen working the front desk had zero remorse and said there was little they could do. Once we spoke to a manager it was quite obvious they did not care. After 20 mins of going back and forth we were able to get the rooms comped.    One of the rooms was not ready till 430pm and I had to go back to the front desk because they never advise the room number after telling me I would receive a text.    My wife tried to order room service the next morning and was on hold for 25 minutes and could not even get the front desk on the line. Once she finally was able to place the order they informed her it was cash only? They eventually called back and the food was brought over an hour later.    The entire point of booking the two bedroom suite was to keep our family together. I am an Mlife gold member and was platinum last year. I make 5-10 Vegas trips a year and will never return to mirage for a meal gambling or hotel stay.    I understand mistakes happen but their lack of remorse proves they only care about their top tier guests. Sad that a Vegas staple has gone so far downhill. Dont spend your money here their price point is the same as Aria and Cosmo but their product is years behind.
30,My husband and I really enjoyed the Stay Well room once we were finally able to check in and once it was actually cleaned. We arrived at 9:30 am and we were told we had fo wait for someone to check out in order to get the room we reserved. I called the front desk at 1 pm and they said they couldn’t provide an ETA but would notify us when the room was ready. I went back to the front desk at 3:45 and was told the room had been ready but staff was really busy and didn’t get a chance to notify me.  We finally get to the room quite exhausted from the travel only to find the room had not been properly cleaned. To be polite I will just say the toilet was “dirty” and so were the sheets.  Housekeeping came up an hour after we reported the situation because they were between shifts. The housekeeper was very friendly and did a great job cleaning the room. They also sent someone the next morning to do another thorough cleaning and she was very friendly too.  Management gave us a $75 credit towards food/stores in the hotel.  The room itself was great. I have really bad allergies but didn't have any trouble this time so the upgrade was totally worth it. The whole floor has air purifiers and aromatherapy the water was softer than usual and I slept really well. The mattress was firm but didn’t bother me like I thought it would. I’m sure I will stay there again on business and will definitely upgrade to the Stay Well.
50,The hotel is lovely. Room was clean spacious and nicely decorated. The tiger and dolphin garden was wonderful. The air quality in the hotel was by far the best of all the other hotels we visited. I could barely breathe from all the smoke in other hotels.
50,The hotel is very beautiful and large. The room was very spacious and clean. The concerige was very attentive to our needs and my wife enjoyed the Boys 2 Men concert a lot. It was in a great location and took no time to get there from the airport.
50,Great place to stay and gamble. Several voices for food drinks and great sports betting area. Like the array of limits on table games that fits everyone’s budget and not so stuffy. Rooms are very comfortable and offered comps for food.
30,The Mirage is Beautiful! People are very nice! Does Not have a coffee maker in the room nor can you request one! And the mini bar is soo expensive that I will not even look at it because if you move something (seriously!) it’s like a motion detector that sends charge to your room!!! And it is a PRICEY MOVE!! Machines do not pay out! seems like general consensus from others I have talked to! The Still Restaurant in the Mirage was FABULOUS!! The staff was very friendly and the food was Great!!  I am off to a different Casino with hopefully Better turnout or payout however you want to look at it!!! LOL!!
10,I only chose this hotel because hubby and i were seeing Boys II Men. I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN!!!!!  1. There was vomit on the side of our bed from the previous occupant.  2. there was no information in the room about the restaurants or shows available at the hotel.  3. there were half full ashtrays all over the casino floor that nobody seemed inclined to clean up.  4. There was no information about checkout available until you were standing in line to checkout. (After standing in line for 20 minutes- and still not reaching the front of the line we finally saw a sign behind the checkout counter that stated we could check out online.)  5. After a little time in the casino we went back to our room at 9:20 AM on the day we were checking out and housekeeping was already in our room- forcing us to check out early.  6. We had to figure out for ourselves that our room key was also the parking pass and had to be inserted in order to exit the parking structure. Thankfully we took the keys when we checked out.
50,This was my first time at the Mirage. And I was very pleased. I am a MGM girl. The lights action gold and lions all provide a great flare for me; however the Mirage was a bit more mild and calming but had the same lights camera action flare. I may convert. Keep up the great work.
20,"$50 corkage. $20-100 for late checkout. $37 ""resort fee"" PER NIGHT (plus a $4.95 resort fee tax). $50 charge for removing items (without consuming) from the mini bar to chill leftovers. No coffee in the room. $24 per day parking. WHAT??!?! I thought parking in Vegas was free. Las Vegas has gotten way out of hand. Gone are the days of looking forward to going. Never again."
50,Great place to stay. Great location. Great staff. The hotel staff is great. People in customer service is key I like talking to people.  We have always like M life but now that they have military rewards it makes it so much better. The competition is lacking in rewards of any kind I suggest that you stay at M life hotels!
10,Let me start off by saying that I have been to Vegas various times and have stayed at the Cosmopolitan Bellagio Palazzo and Planet Hollywood and have never experienced anything like this. I would recommend all the hotels listed above. The customer service was terrible. Not one employee seemed to genuinely care about anything I was saying. Based on the performance of the staff I know it’s very unlikely this survey/review is even elevated to someone higher or someone who cares. I was there for a friends wedding and the entire bridal party stayed there and had the same experience I had with the overall accommodations and experience with the staff. The group of 10 were all disappointed and even more so the bride and groom for choosing this as the hotel and recommending it to everyone else. My room said 65 degrees with the fan on high and there was no way that it was even close to 70. Unbelievably warm in the room despite the call to the desk. Everyone had the same HVAC issues as I did. The “updated” room included plenty of rust in the bathroom blackout blinds with plenty of holes in them and outlets that did not hold a plug. Also how could I forget the lovely construction noise on the floor I was on. Again when speaking to the staff memeber at the desk they just brushed it off and said sorry. Upon check out I noticed a slew of charges that I did not authorize so I had to wait in the lenghlty line to speak to someone yet again. Breanna the girl who checked me out just said I’ll take off 2 days of resort fees and remove the charges. No apology just a blanketed statement that we are under construction to fix the problems. I understand things happen and the hotel is trying to improve but no one cared and it was very obvious. So disappointing. If there are problems guests should not be placed in those rooms. I can’t speak to the Casino because I don’t gamble nor to the restaurants because I didn’t want to waste my money based on the overall experience of the hotel.
50,Not too ritzy not too “budget”. The perfect combination of class and fun. Great location on the strip with close walks to nearby resorts. Tables limits are very reasonable even on the weekends (numerous $10-$15 available). Friendly and welcoming staff. The daily spa pass is the best kept secret. Start your day with a hot tub and sauna to refresh after a long Vegas night. Roland in the spa is the best... salt of the earth kinda guy. This was trip #2 to The Mirage and surely not the last!
50,Tropical feel Resort  Comfortable Rooms  I really appreciated the security check points after 11pm near elevators to access rooms  Friendly staff  The Pantry is a great place to eat your meals-The fish and chips were so good!
40,A very nice hotel . One of the bigger Vegas venues Location is perfect for the strip . The hotel is a busy  always . Several restaurants and bars . Room was decent size but no tea/coffee making facilities which is odd . Our room had a damaged head board so got a refund on our fees  which maid service tried to hide with pillows
50,This grand old lady still shows her style and quality. If you are a young hip poser looking for the hippest scene to be seen this is not your place. But if great value cleanliness safety good food options location and a ton of good gambling options are your speed  ...saddle up.
50,The Mirage has a really good variety of restaurants and bars inside. The pool area is very nice. The staff is always pleasant and helpful. The rooms are a very nice size and has a lot of storage space.
40,My friend and I couldn't quite tell what it was that made the Mirage better in the casino areas than a few of the others. The carpeting the lights the air the general ambiance was really much better than others. The basic room was very comfortable no coffee provided whatsoever and there was literal space in the door frame and you could see light through it. Doors slammed and were very bad at blocking hallway conversations. Showerhead was almost painful and took a long time to rinse soap off my head. Otherwise linens were comfy mattress was just right view of the pool was nice!
20,I booked this hotel ahead of time and received an invoice with a total to pay. When arrived to check in they charged me additional fees I didn't know about saying there were resort fees (like $50 per night). I complained but they still charged it. On top of it the medium size bottle of water they offer in the room cost $18 dollars and the price tag wasn't no where until i got my bill. The casino are is full of cigarette smoke and you can't escape it cause you pass by there to go to the elevators. Oh! the gym closes of 6pm ??? I do not recommend this hotel.
40,The restaurants at this Casino are second to none. Stills & Osteria Costa are my favorites with Stacks a close 3rd. The sports book lounge is comfortable and airy but a bit dated. There could be more large screens added to arena so you could keep up with the plethora of games to gamble on.
30,The rooms at the Mirage are starting to show their age. The carpeting was old and not very clean. The drainage in the bathroom both sink and shower was extremely slow. The view from the room was phenomenal though with a clear view of the strip and the volcano
40,I have stay at this hotel a couple of times. I was very happy with the cleanliness of the room and bed comfort. Location on the strip was great. The Casino is good though drink service in the video poker area not as frequent as it could be.
30,Not what I expected. It was nice clean and rooms are average. Expected a little more for this hotel. Not happy to arrive and the room that I booked was not available even checked in through Mobil app and that didn’t work so had to check in at the counter. I was super disappointed.
40,Mirage was an OK casino however they screwed me over on the room pricing for the convention - I called after i booked my room for the convention and then i needed to add one more night. They told me that they had sold out of the convention rooms and that it would be double the price! My co-worker booked the same day/night right after my call and received convention pricing with no issues. I feel like i have been scammed by the mirage.
50,Celebrated my 60th Birthday at the Mirage Vegas . Great location on the strip Wonderful staff. Housekeeping great We ate breakfast most mornings at the Pantry and enjoyed wings and Prossecco in the The Still Bar all excellent.  Would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again
10,Stayed for convention only because it was finally renovated and thought it would be convenient for my clients. This hotel is decent. It’s just ok. It’s mid class but there are so many nicer ones and you can stay for the same price if you just shop around so why stay here unless you have to.    Check in was ok ONLY because it was 3 am. The rest of our party and the majority of the convention had horrific experiences. We had a cocktail party at 6 pm. Our suite was not ready until after 4 pm. It is supposed to be ready by 3. We had meetings beginning 3:30. We had to take the meetings outdoor with no place to plug into a monitor for presentation. Despite pleas for a temp room the desk just couldn’t care less. Like robots they repeated that there is no guarantee on check in. We just state that the room is available after 3. Great service. Others were treated with congratulations you are upgraded to the bellagio (yes a half mile from the convention) but your suite is here and you can run back and forth all day. They oversold rooms. Again. They don’t care.    Cocktail party night came and the food was ridiculously over priced and pretty disgusting. The sandwiches were something from a school cafeteria. Antipasti was subpar and embarrassing. Needless to say one can only imagine the prices when you use $9 per mini hot dog as a gauge. After the bartender left some others came and when we realized there wasn’t a cork screw we call down to the desk. We were told it would be $6 plus a 45 min wait to bring one up! Yes after spending thousands on a cocktail party.    I think the best part about the party was the fact that there is no elevator guard. Since the suites are secured one must use a special card to reach the penthouse suites in the elevator. We did not know this in advance or we would never book. So after begging and pleading and offering to pay ridiculous sums of money to hire someone and provide that person with a guest list we were told NO. You must have people from your party come downstairs every time someone wants to go up! We invited over 70 people. We all had clients. Many of them we never met in person. Some of us actually missed meeting our clients because we were on elevator duty for our cocktail party we spent thousands of dollars on.    This hotel has the worst customer service I have ever experienced from any place I ever stayed. I won’t even comment on the rooms. It doesn’t matter if they are gorgeous or ugly. I would NEVER EVER stay here again because customer service is everything and the MIRAGE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS. They make this very clear from the moment you arrive. Maybe because it was a convention and they feel you have no choice but even if the convention is at the mirage again I will not physically stay in this hotel ever again.    Mirage if you have the guts to reach out to me feel free.
50,The Mirage is our go-to hotel out at Vegas and it once again lived up to expectations. The prices are very reasonable food is great and the Casino table minimums are very acceptable. We've stayed at many other properties in Vegas but always come back to the Mirage
40,Great local as you can walk across the street instead of the up and over.  Wonderful staff!  Very cool atrium with live fish.  Only issue was how far you have to walk each time you go in and out of the elevators and through the lobby to get to parking area.
40,The Mirage is a great Hotel and Casino. I did turn $5 into $53.50 as I enjoyed a Tequila Sunrise. The hotel offers computers to checkin and print off boarding passes for your flights which worked out great for me because the app wasn't letting me checkin. The room was nice and the bed was comfortable. We ordered room service and had a few drinks out of the mini bar. Everything the was good. I would probably stay at a different hotel next time to get a different experience.
50,I've had 10 trips to Vegas in 10 years and I've stayed all the way in the south end of the strip at Excalibur Aria in the middle - Flamingo Bally's Golden Nuggett downtown and also Bellagio and I can tell you the Mirage is the best hotel for ambiance relaxation pool area shops restaurants safety - and fun GAMES. I've never won a jackpot there but the drinks are nice service is great the room was nice. All made for a perfect trip. I felt appreciated at the Mirage.
50,The Mirage is very clean; safe if you travel alone or with just the girls; centrally located; and our Executive Slot Hostess is great for help booking your trip especially when travelling from a fair distance Shows  accommodations transportation.. anything you need to make your mini vacation the best The restaurants & cafes offer excellent cuisine.
40,We had 3 nights in a 2 queen room. No view at all (4th floor - overlooking rooftops with the strip in the distance) but that was ok as we had a comped room and have been to Las Vegas many times. I used the self check in but with a late flight had to go to the counter for key pick up anyhow as the kiosks were closed. It wasn't busy so not an issue. Would have been nice if the check in person had asked about how we arrived - ie we had a car; we could have avoided a bit of a problem with parking the next day as no one linked our room key to the parking and we had to pay cash for a ticket 2x so no in/out privilege. We went to desk next day and they fixed it up and refunded a nights resort fee in compensation which I thought was fair. Housekeeping was great and we would have enjoyed the pool on a fairly nice day but arrived at 3:50 and they closed at 4:00. We have been to the Mirage several times and it met all expectations. It's a great resort in a great location and has great shows and restaurants on site.
10,Went there to see the Terry Fator show but just because you are in the casino you get gouged really bad like $20 USD for two bowls of soup and $14 USD for a rum and coke thanks but no thanks won’t be back again.
40,Room a little old in bathroom but overall clean. They were plenty of towels.  Buffet not much selection food was sitting for a while. But the prime rib was very good.  Nevertheless it was clean great location and I would go again
50,"The accommodations were great. The staff provided good customer service consistently; starting with the Maid Service to the Food Delivery. The meeting rooms were in close proximity to the guest rooms. Nice shopping opportunities too. The Mirage knows how to host a ""guest'."
40,The mirage was very clean. the rooms were small but served their purpose. we didn't have a strip view but who cares. there is no indoor pool. too cold for outside one which was open for a few hours. The casino didn't smell of smoke which is a plus. The staff were all friendly and quickly responded to our needs and requests. do not touch the items in the fridge! You will be charged once you pick up that bottle off its weighted base. we had to call down to guest services to get the $45 bottle of fireball off our bill. Great location on las vegas blvd. Restaurants were pricey so we did not eat in any of them. Try Hash House a go-go in the Linq. you won't be disappointed.
10,We were sent here to attend a conference and billed the rooms to the company card. We didn't have said card upon check in so we spent hours going back and forth to our boss trying to get him to sign CC authorization forms so they'd allow us to check in. Also we booked through expedia because when you pull up the mirage online they advertise to book through these third parties. They messed up the order and gave us a room instead of a suite so we had to cancel and book one last minute at another casino. Cancelling with expedia was a back and forth between them and the front desk and took hours across 2 days to resolve.  Checking out was just as difficult because of the CC again. Also when I turned in my keys no one told me that I wouldn't be able to get out of the parking garage so I had to go back and stand in line AGAIN to get a new key made just to let me leave.
20,played at the bar poker & was told after playing a while that you only get one drink & the then I order a second glass of house wine  & he said that will be $12.00 so I paid the money & told him to drink it  was bad & then we went next door to the Treasure island & we spent the rest of the evening there & they were much friendlier no rules  very disappointed we the mirage this time !
30,The hotel is average. You can smell smoke nearly everywhere on the main floor. The restaurants are expensive (which is normal in Vegas). The bed part of the room was fine. The bathroom was awful. Lights were out (if you think this isn’t important try being a woman attempting to apply make-up in half darkness). The fan was useless. The shower clearly hadn’t been maintained in the almost 40 years since the hotel opened. The floor was dirty and gritty there looked to be something growing out of the drain the handle wasn’t really attached to anything and there was a hole in the wall.
40,"I've been to Vegas many many times. Stayed various places. I always choose the Mirage now. I'll never give a Vegas hotel 5 stars there are always cons in a city like this but Mirage is the best I've experienced. I always have pros and cons in Vegas but Mirage is the best value for the price. I've always had great customer service on the phone and in person (we have switched rooms many times for different reasons and they have never hesitated) the rooms all have a legit view the pool is one of the best in Vegas and it's free Volcano show Cirque du Solei the rooms look nice and are updated awesome restaurant selection no matter the time of day prime location on the strip. I'd only switch resorts at this point if one of my ""dream resorts"" was cheaper than the Mirage and it has yet to happen. I come twice a year and even if I don't stay at the Mirage I'd stop by for the other amenities."
30,"This was my second stay at the Mirage the first being about 5 years ago. It is not aging well. It felt outdated smoky and downscale. After a few years break from the Las Vegas casino scene you begin to see just how much MGM Mirage nickels and dimes people compared to Hyatt Marriott Hilton and others.    Check-in was quick and friendly and the walk from the parking garage to the check-in desk is one of the shortest on the strip which is a plus. Oh and they charge for parking unless you have MGM status which I had only because of their partnership with Hyatt. If you have any status with Hyatt be sure to get that matched by M Life Rewards as it can save you some money.    My room was on the 17th floor and had a standard ""mountain view."" When I opened the door it reeked of bleach which (I suppose) means it was clean. The room was very tired and worn feeling. There's a fridge in the room but it is wired to the hilt in order to get charges on your room bill for removing minibar items. There's even a sign that if you try to store your own stuff in the fridge you will incur a $50 fee. Tacky!    The towels felt thin there was a loud fan in the bathroom and there was nothing impressive about the room. The lighting in the bathroom mirror was quite good which was nice. The bed was somewhat comfortable and there was a lack of plugs next to the bed which is completely annoying in 2019.    I was attending a conference at Caesar's Palace Convention Center next door. ""Next door"" still meant at least a 20-minute walk to get to where I needed to go but it could have been worse. Walking is good but the STENCH of the casino is awful - this is one of the smokiest putrid smelling casinos on the strip. If you are sensitive to smoke do not stay here.    Late check out? Forget it unless you want to pay - status or not. In fact despite having a sign on the door housekeeping barged in at 11:30 in the morning (check out was at noon) with a 1-second warning and acted shocked that someone was in there. Very poor service and no apology.    Vegas isn't what it used to be and the play to suck your money away at every chance is quite apparent. The Mirage must be next up on the list for major renovations. In its current form it is a downscale property that needs to be renovated. It reminds me of the old ""Monte Carlo"" before it was recently transformed. It's acceptable but nothing special."
50,Another great stay at the Mirage. Simply a great location and a great value. Our room was very spacious for the 4 of us and a beautiful view. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. Will definitely stay here again on our next visit.
50,Stay was excellent massages were excellent food service at the Pantry & Costa was along wait to give order and extrem long wait to get food served all hands at the tables were very good would stay again
30,Hotel was clean and comfortable great choices of gaming but prices seemed a bit steep. Food selections were ok good but not necessarily worth the money. I would definitely stay here again would just not eat there.
50,Spent 3 nights here. Upgraded to a Tower room and worth the extra $$. Disappointed that we were told my son would also be eligible for upgrade but when he checked in the rooms were no longer available; didn’t seem like Tower was that busy...    Slot machines were fun roulette dealers kept us at the tables and enjoyed burgers at LVB and the Beatles Cirque de Soleil. Don’t miss the dolphins and gardens in the back - gorgeous and a nice change from the casino.    Will be back but next time get better assurance that our rooms are near one another.
50,Location location location. Perfect location on the strip. Some great restaurants and bars. Rooms are big clean and most with great views of the strip the volcano or the dolphins pools. They have small zoo out the back with the white tigers and other big cats. The Bare pool for the daring.
40,Staff was very friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean and quiet although bathroom was a bit small. Wish hot tub area would have stayed open later. It closed around 5 just when ya wanna have a soak!!
50,Great location! Traveled with my family including two teenagers. We all had a blast. Lots to do. The teens loved the convenient location and the Starbucks in the hotel. We loved the casino. Staff were all very friendly!
20,The stay could have been better we arrived in our room and without my girlfriends knowledge she accidentally picked up one of the snack inside the room well they are on censors and we were charge$15 for a bag of m&ms not to mention the fridge is completely stocked and are not allowed to put personal items in it or they will charge you $50. Now let’s head to the blackjack tables where they offer $10 minimum bets with 6/5 blackjack payout. 4-6decks also fed into the continuous shuffle machine and dealer hits on soft 17 which is completely robbery and a waste of time.
40,Went to Vegas to see the Canucks play the Knights. Went for 4 nights. This was my wife’s first time. We had a great time exploring shopping and hanging out at the pool. Hotel was clean and the staff was alway really friendly.
30,Check in line was long. I felt like I was at the airport. Light in bathroom was out making it hard to put makeup on. Walls were thin. I could easily hear conversation in the hall making it hard to sleep. Don't accidentally bump the food on the counter for purchase or you'll be charged $15 for it! Fridge so packed full of booze you can't fit a water bottle in it and you'll get charged for moving stuff around.
50,the Mirage is a great place to stay. everything you need is on the premises. Walking through the hotel feels like your on an island getaway. Many places to eat shows dolphins & lions to visit. The room is greatclean roomy bed is comfortable. A table/desk to work on or eat. I've gone there many times & I know I'll go again
40,Great resort rooms are showing a little age but not bad. All the restaurants were great. There isn’t too much I could find bad about this resort. All in all I would recommend the Mirage for future trips.
50,This was my second trip to Las Vegas and second stay in the Mirage. I can't imagine staying anywhere else. From top to bottom this is a superior place to stay. I can't thank security enough for there help in finding a lost bag of souvenirs but all staff was pleasant and helpful. The rooms were very comfortable and restaurants excellent. Kudos to the hotel management.
50,Nice spacious rooms numerous restaurants almost smoke-free environment plenty of things to do beside gambling. Great location & easy to get to - right in the middle of the action. Good drinks but expensive.
30,My room was dirty and the floor was a visible mess. There was dust everywhere.Went to Mandalay to visit a friends room. It was a much better experience there. The 24 hour pantry service was quick but the food was cold.
30,My wife and I have been staying with the mirage many tines over the past 10 years.    We are finding that the quality of service the in the hotel has been going down stay after stay.  We never receive any upgrades or offer as gold card member instead we only get reasons(excuses) as to why we can never get any such perks.  We asked for an upgrade on our room as it states that gold card member are untitled to free upgrades but we were told that there were no room available....after being told that we could have an upgrade for a fee!  Also two of our friends revived upgrades to suites without any issues and neither of them are gold card members and barely ever stay at mlife properties.
30,Buffet could have been better more of a variety would have been nice to have I had the same thing for 3 days straight and dinner wasn’t any better so lunch and dinner really needs a better menu to choose from
50,staff was extremely friendly and rooms were super clean. Casino was clean and there were loys of slots to pick from plus the variety was great.  The quick check in was a nice addition to our stay. Valet serice was awesome - worth the price
40,We stay here a lot. Rooms are comfortable the restaurants are good the casino is friendly and well laid out. Just know that I have had numerous problems with the safe not working. And it didn't work this time. And I am not interested in sitting around waiting for maintenance to show up to fix it. Been there done that.
20,Checked in and was offered an upgrade decided to accept it as she really talked it up and said the bathtub was amazing and a nice shower sounded nice. Got up to the room and the bathroom was dirty blood on toilet and bathtub as well as dirt in the tub and other mystery stains. Shower was dirty lights kept surging and there was something stuck in the outlet. There was a blood mark on the sheets as well and the suite was not very clean. Been multiple times and this was by far the worst experience I’ve had complained and was basically told “ sorry we’ll do better next time”
50,"Was in Las Vegas to go to Spring Mountain Corvette School and then two days at the Mirage. The Beatles ""Love"" was great. Saw some friends that live in Las Vegas The Mirage is a great location to explore the strip. Will be back."
40,The hotel is great. The only downside was the smoking. Please eliminate the smoking or give smokers a designated room. Having the casino near the lobby hotels shops allows the smell to travel and it makes it difficult for non smokers to breathe. Other than that the stay was great.
50,"Mirage has everything you expect from Las Vegas. We go several times a year and only stay at the Mirage. Can't beat short stroll from your room to the casino and the entire resort staff is tops. Beatles ""Love' is a must see we have seen 6 times and you still experience something new each time."
40,Overall a very nice hotel clean lots of variety in food. However when we checked in there were issues with our bookings and our request of a joint room wasn’t met so we had to take side by side rooms as no joint ones would be ready in the hour. The hotel itself is in a decent location on the strip with a lot of near by restaurants. Would definitely recommend going to the Cravings buffet ! Great food service and bottomless mimosas. The one downfall was that you literally paid for everything. With the resort fees you’re charged you would think certain things like the Dolphin habitat would be free for guests or that you could even call the front desk to ask for a complimentary bottle opener but no such luck. In the end though it was a great experience !
40,We really enjoyed our stay at the Mirage. We went into many of the resorts on the strip and we were so glad we stayed here. It was clean great staff good amenities and loved the animals!    The food at the resort was a pricey compared to what we saw at some of the other resorts but all the food was very good and the staff were helpful and pleasant.
50,We have been going to Las Vegas since 1999 and this is the best place to stay. It is in the middle of the strip and within walking distance of the other casinos if you are a walker. It is not huge inside so easy to get around. The pool area is amazing and we spend a lot of time there. There are very good restaurants inside. Some are pricey but the food is good. .
30,We traveled from the uk to stay her for 5 nights.  Hotel and casino are spotless. The staff are lovely and helpful. Being four women traveling alone I felt very safe in the hotel/casino. The reason why I give this hotel a 3 is the extortionate prices I understand you pay at the bar inflated prices but on check out I had taken a bottle of water of the minibar that cost $2 at most and they charged me $18 disgraceful and the best they could do for our friends birthday was give us a room key saying happy birthday to go to the front of the queue at the buffet!!!!!
40,My gf and I celebrated our 1 year anniversary together this weekend at The Mirage. We had a great experience. The dinning options stuck out as superb. I enjoyed the lunch buffet. $6 unlimited beer and wine? Can’t beat that. The Carnegie Deli is a must visit for first timers. Great food.    We also appreciated how centrally located the hotel was to the rest of the strip. It was nice being able to walk from our show at the Bellagio back to The Mirage with little effort and only a great view of the fountains on our walk back.
40,Beautiful resort clean and secure hotel. The public areas were too cold but we added a few layers and survived. We felt security housekeeping and the casino waitresses did exceptional work. Enjoyed the stay.
50,Very pleased with our stay at Mirage. It had something for each family member. The buffet was great staff friendly casino and rooms clean. Would have liked to have a coffee maker and a frig in room.
50,Nice get away. Room was clean service was excellent. It would have been nice to know more about m rewards at check in and learn rules of gambling. B  Never having gambled before it would have been nice and we would have felt more confident about playing the tables.
20,Door locks kept malfunctioning.  Shower hardly sprayed.  Electric sockets only one worked.  No plugs on night stands.  Room service never once answered in several days. Front desk would not check to see why room service never  answered!!  No room in frig for any personal items. All frig and counter mini bar items had motion detectors so you couldn’t move anything around to put your own items.  So many other issues.
40,The Mirage is very convenient if you want to stay on the strip. Easy walking to most of the major attractions and casinos. It has numerous restaurants. Nice clean and spaceous rooms. The staff is very friendly and helpful.
50,Loved the hotel but like everything in Vegas busy busy busy but saying that the staff were always nice and helpful and willing to take time to help with any requests. Excellent location on the strip and would definitely use the Mirage again. Thanks guys had an amazing week.
10,Poorly maintained hotel..saw multiple rooms including torn headboard in several places. Major risk of bead bugs and other infestations. Third world quality. Stay away. Not appropriate in us for hotel of this status. Staff could care less. Not on par with similarly ranked hotels based on prior experience like aria. This is mgms third tier needing massive overhaul and commitment to upkeep.
50,We might have come home with a lot less money due to the fact I spent alot of time in the casino but we had great fun and food. We have already recommended to family that is planning on a trip in late March or early April.
50,During my stay at the Mirage I used the following hotel services: Cravings Restaurant breakfast buffet Siegfried and Roy Animal Park Mirage Volcano the casino and the Beatles Love Cirque Show and box office. The weather was nice so I was also able to spend a short time at the pool. All the activities were good to excellent as was my room and the staff I came in contact with- The overall location of the hotel makes visiting other main casinos on the Strip within walking distance. The casino was comparable to other casinos I have visited.
50,I love this place! The food is great. You have shopping galore next door all the way up to Caesar’s. The comps and reward program gives you plenty of free perks. My spa was comped from my play. This place always has a good show! I love Terry Fator! The Japanese restaurant is awesome! The beds are comfy and the rooms are large. I can’t say enough good things about the mirage! 5 stars!
50,We had a great stay at the Mirage. The front desk was friendly and accommodating. The conseige wS helpful and kind. The housekeeping staff was great! The diner with the county theme was adorable and delicious.
50,Great place. It’s clean and comfortable. Staff is friendly. Centrally locates to easily walk to other places on the strip. This has been our hotel of choice out last few stays in Vegas. Wish there were a few more reasonable dining options and miss having coffee in the room.
50,We love traveling to Vegas for quick mini vacations and the Mirage is one of our favorite places to stay. It is located centrally to a lot of the best places to visit gamble eat and people watch on the strip and we've always received outstanding customer service when we've stayed there. This time was no different. There appeared to be a shortage of the type resort room we'd booked and since we arrived on a late flight and rather than just shuffling us into a different room type (two queens etc.) instead of our requested resort king they went ahead and upgraded us to a penthouse suite. Customer service like this is why we will continue to stay at the mirage when we visit Vegas.
40,Good staff good restaurant (pantry) and good stores. I missed out on the show. One oak night club has really good sound quality. Need more restaurants maybe just for different cuisines and have already given then notes about noisy door/latch.
50,We like staying at the Mirage because of the location. Their rooms are also very nice and the front desk service is always pleasant and friendly.  The only issue we had this time was zero counter space in the bathroom.
40,"Room location and description did not match. Supposed to be strip view room had great view of pool roof and small strip view to one side and freeway view to other side. Cost was higher for ""strip view"" and we ended up changing to a real strip view room on second night after getting the tour company involved because hotel staff just blew it off."
50,This place is awesome people were great staff members were polite. Rooms good size and very clean  Restaurant were to die for and the gambling between poker and slots was actually good  You have to try this place
50,"This was my first trip to Vegas and glad I stayed at the mirage.  We enjoyed the carvings buffet for breakfast. The restaurant ""the pantry"" was a bit pricey. However LBV had one of the best chicken sandwiches that I have ever eaten"
50,The Mirage is a great hotel if you're looking for a place located central on the strip. My friends and I booked a Deluxe Tower Suite for a bachelorette party for two nights this past weekend. The staff were genuinely friendly welcoming and courteous from the moment we checked in to the time we checked out. Since we booked a suite one of the gentleman helping us at the front desk took the time to show us the VIP lounge. It was an amazing perk to have since the lounge offers free beverages including beer wine coffee tea water juice and soda. It's open daily so you can come and go as you please. I definitely took advantage of that and stopped by every morning to get my coffee. Self-parking in the garage is $15 for over 4 hours to 24 hours; however if you're an MLife gold card member like me parking is free at any of the MGM resort properties.    The two bedroom suite was gorgeous and humongous! It had a living room with a couch dining table bar with a mini fridge (that had its own ice maker) 2 full bathrooms and 2 bedrooms (1 room with a king bed and the other room with 2 queen beds). With all that space it fit 6 girls comfortably. In addition the beds were super soft the shower pressure was strong (which is a big thing for me) provides plenty of towels for our large group and the suite was very clean and well maintained.    One major thing that really stood out for me was when we called house keeping to see if they can service our room since we were leaving for a few hours. We came back later to find the suite to be tidy and clean. We got a phone call just moments after we walked in from someone following up to make sure our room was clean. That really impressed me on how efficient they were in getting our room clean in a timely fashion.    Overall my friends and I had a wonderful stay here. I highly recommend this place.
50,The Mirage has great customer service and loose slots! Great games to choose from and very accessible for the handicapped. You might want to bring your own small coffee pot to avoid paying $15.00 for hot water if you want to make your own tea. It's not a complaint because other than that everything was great. It's just a suggestion.
50,The Mirage never gets old to us. We were there 4nights and never left the property. It’s very clean great air circulation and has a nice selection of food choices. Room service was nice as well. Our favorite show in LV is Love so it was nice just going straight from our room to the show. Art of Music is a really cool shop to visit as well. We will definitely be back.
10,Starting to get run down. Cooler was not on in my room for two days it was 84 in room. They didn't send a technician finally I demanded a new room. The only thing they did to make up for it was take one resort fee off........pfff Better places to stay for this amount of money. Pool closes at 4pm in the winter.
30,We were given a room close to the elevators. A lot of people keep passing by our room and we could hear everything they said clearly. It was very hard to fall asleep when it was that loud. Thank you very much.
50,Our trip to Vegas was made most memorable by our stay at the Mirage! We received first class service in all areas of our stay! The Buffet Package really made our trip reasonable plus the food was delicious! The personal in every department were friendly and helpful! We would recommend a trip to this hotel and casino!
20,Room was not great. Found long black hairs in the shower and bottle of cleaning liquid was left in the bathroom. We did receive one night free but later had more issues. Toilet seat was left soaking wet and we had to clean it off. On our last morning the light in the shower was leaking very cold water. It wasn't just a drip it was a lot of water coming out and we had to shower with the cold water coming down on us. We reported it to the front desk but they didn't offer any compensation. Although the location is very good and the lobby nice I wouldn't stay here again.
50,Beautiful hotel. Rooms were excellent. The food in the Cravings buffet was not impressive at all. The smoke was really bad. I am not s smoker so it was really annoying to smell smoke EVERY where I went
50,I think the Mirage is a great hotel that is centrally located on the strip. Rooms are well appointed with comfy beds. We used rewards to stay at this hotel and got a great deal on our stay. I would stay here again.
30,I have stay at the Mirage for the past 3 years and it is starting to show wear. Not as sharp as in the past. Need some additional staff on the gaming floor. No one thing was bad overall it was overpriced for the age.
40,We went for dinner and a show only. Parking was amazingly hard! Maybe we are dummies but we kept pulling into areas for employees and deliveries! Thanks WAZE!  The whole pay to park thing wasn't so bad as my husband is a Veteran the $15 fee would be free. Only once outside the machine would not recognize the card so we ended up paying anyway. Getting out of there was no fun either one lane of 100's of cars exiting at the same time. When there is a show have two lanes open to leave!    The casino smelled great. We saw a lot of smokers smoking but it smelled like vanilla cookies. Who knows what we were breathing in!    We ate at CPK. WE only had an hour and did not want to risk the other places on a Saturday night at 8:30pm it was crowded! The menu is limited not what you would get from a CPK anywhere else. Service friendly and prompt. Prices normal too.    We saw George Lopez in the Terry Fator Theater. It was a great show and we cannot wait to come back and see another here. The venue wasn't too large and with the exception of long isles and people jumping up constantly to get a drink trampelling over us it was pretty nice.    We played a few slots for about an hour. Tight. Normal. Still had fun.    I look forward to an offer to maybe come stay or see another show. Now that we know where to park!
50,"Our trip to the Mirage Hotel & Casino was ""Magical"". We came to Las Vegas for the magic shows. The Mirage was centrally located and very reasonably priced. The Cravings Buffet was GREAT for breakfast and supper ( beer and wine are included)!"
50,We arrived on a Wednesday for an eight night stay. The casino was busy lots of friendly people good food big fun. The Cravings Buffet is in my opinion is the best Buffet in Vegas and a great value. Their military program is the best.
10,When room above used sink water leaked down to ours putting water on floor and sink. water came through light fixture. Lighting in bathroom very dim wife had to put make up on in living area. Heat set @ 70 and fan blew cold air
40,Great place to stay to eat at a great restaurant but a bad place to gamble. Had fun but lost thousands... Nice ice machine  sports book was terrible. nice food at the restaurants. great staff...would stay again...
30,Had to wait on hold for 1 hr and 45 mins just to order room service and when I got order it was wrong and got charged for things I never received. And was hard to regulate temp in room. Staff was friendly. Mobile check out is the way to go if you plan a stay there.
50,This was our first stay at The Mirage and we will definitely stay there again. The room was large clean and updated. The staff was very friendly. The Mirage is centrally located on the Strip; so a great location.
50,All customer service personnel from check in to housekeeping servers and any other employees encountered during our stay were professional courteous and knowledgeable. The bed was comfortable the pillows sheets and towels were very nice! The carpeting is definitely due for an update but everything was clean. Everything in Vegas is expensive including the restaurants. We were a bit unprepared for food and drink prices. My advice is to bring your own water soft drinks and snacks. However the drink service while I was playing slots was pretty regular and that was nice.
50,I enjoyed my stay at the Mirage. Staff was great; they were friendly and helpful. My room was clean and well taken care of. I liked the fitness center it was large and well equipped. I would stay there again.
30,Our association had a conference and it was a good location within walking distance to many things to do. The check-in process was fast the food overpriced and I recommend to skip the Buffett. The rooms lack enough plugs if you have more than 2 devices or want it next to your bed. The beds were not that great and the bedding was extremely thin. Terry Fator was a great show.
50,Good location clean and comfy rooms casino restrooms with good built material early check in hold luggage after checkout great show with hotel guest discount Carnegie sandwich shop recommended.
50,staying at the mirage is a great experience and one everybody should go thru.. they will always be my first choice .. great atmosphere great good great rooms easy to get in parking was reallly nice
10,Rooms are dated. Mold in the shower. They charged me 24.00 for a long distance call. I have two cell phones. The quality of food for the burger bar was substandard. Stacks bar was terrible. I would recommend some place else for 200+ a night.
50,In the very center of the casino is the Center Bar. Right where all the action is happening. The servers were great and they had s decent champagne selection. The bar stools were comfy and there were tables and chairs too
50,Bit of delayed review stayed in November over marathon weekend. Last stayed here 9 years ago and still very impressed. Hotel Location excellent with good facilities and clean tidy and safe. Check in was easy and the selection of restaurants were very good if a bit busy at breakfast.  There may very well be other hotels that are as good or better on the strip but we have found an hotel that works for us so it will always be first choice for us in vegas
20,CONS    Room not serviced  Skimpy towels  Water coming in through the window dripping down the walls  Two wash clothes for a room with 3 registered guests  2 days with no hot water  Incorrect charges on the bill    PROS    Clean  Friendly Staff
50,Mirage was a great stay. Staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful at all times. Availability in house restaurants and bars was great!! Room was comfy and clean. More than that quiet! Would book again!
40,We have stayed at the Mirage many times and never been put in the west wing. The front desk told us we were getting an accessible room but if we wanted a view of the strip it was an extra $10 per night. We declined and only lasted one night because trains run right behind the west wing almost steady all night long. I will give the front desk credit as we were moved to the north wing and the room was much better. No extra charge either!
40,Stayed here three nights last week.. Had a relatively decent stay here.. As always the resort fees seem to be high esp during offseason but every hotel has them here in Vegas.    Check-In was a breeze and was able to accomodate our request for rooms to be close by.    Room itself was comfortable. Our only issue was half of the plugs were so loose that they were unusable so I would recommend fixing those.. Shower was great. Beds were comfy and we slept well when we there.    Casino treated us fairly some winning sessions some losing sessions nothing extreme. Drinks were given away reasonably(definitely longer waits at night) Location was great. Beatles show was ok..    When we come back we will consider the Mirage again.
30,Stayed here based on the recommendation of friends who liked this property. It fell well short of my expectations. I usually stay at the Pallazzo or Venitian which are considerably nicer in every way. Better reward system for gaming nicer hotel rooms and better food options. My biggest gripe with this property were with the check in and restaurant. I was sold on a two bedroom suite as an upgrade only to be told that it wasn’t available minutes later. At Heritage Steakhouse my steak was served cold. Expected at Sizzler but unacceptable when paying $60 a steak...
50,We stayed in a king bed sized room and really enjoyed our view of the strip. Plenty of storage for clothes. Doors seemed to be a bit thin or those walking the hallway were extra loud. Looking forward to future stays
50,Amazing place to stay and play! Super clean first of all! Very nice beds and great staff! Always helpful and courteous . For being a casino hotel is is first rate. Also very quiet. Make this your first choice!
30,If you plan on drinking at the Casino floor you better bring your own drinks..The drink girls are very rude andtake almost 20-30 minutes to finally bring you a drink..If you enjoy a nice steak I recomment eating at Collicios restaurant..Very nice staff there and very friendly and eager to satisfy you..I'm not a smoker so the smoke filled casino was orrible to the lungs. There was no escape to my knowledge as everywhere I walked there was smoke..
20,It was ok. Priced high for what you get. No coffee maker in the room. I never seen that before. Overprice and not wanted mini bar. I would have peered a refrigerator that I could put my own stuff in. Asking for one and was told they didn't do that staff was polite and can't blame them for the companies policies. Won't stay again.
50,My overall experience at the Casino was excellent. The Casino Restaurants and shows were great. The room and maid service were a big disappointment. The overall experience was one of the best I have ever had in Vegas!
50,Great resort and amenities. Room very clean and up to date. Staff friendly. Do get the Spa pass.. it was awesome. No microwave or refrigerators in the room and hot water was $15. Should offer you some water with your room.
50,I love this place. Had a couple of incidents where the staff was amazing and the customer service perfect. Cannot complain at all. Had 2 rooms. 1 was the Hospitality Suite. Great room but could use some updating. All in all an amazing place to stay. 3rd time and 4th will come for sure
30,Bathrooms are terrible old rusty tub loudly vibrating shower temp difficult to control in shower and bathroom faucet.  Staff and especially housekeeping were excellent. Beds were very comfortable and had a great view of volcano (in the snow was pretty impressive!)
50,From the moment I checked in 3 hours early the Mirage was obviously a step above other strip hotels. Great dinning not harsh cigarette smells clean rooms and easy check out made this trip stand out. I will be back..
40,The Mirage was a great base for my trip to Las Vegas. Centrally located reasonably priced and nicely themed. I appreciated that the casino was not too smokey which was a real fear after visiting some of the others on the strip. The rooms are a bit dated and worn but no real problems. Reception concierge and the bell desk were all pleasant and helpful.    My one complaint was being woken up on the last day several hours before check-out by someone doing room checks by knocking on and opening up the door. This was quite annoying as we had been out late the night before and were planning on sleeping in until it actually necessary to be up for check out. It was a unfortunate end to an otherwise nice visit.
20,Refrigerator can't be used for anything personal even to keep a medicine cold you can't remove anything since they have sensors and if you move something they are gonna charge you. Each Coke can is $10 I took out 2 bottles to put a medicine inside and the room service took them away at check out they were charging me with more than $200 for things that were moved. Check in and check out lines are kind of long. Only one Starbucks for the whole hotel with long lines at breakfast.
20,I was n0t impressed with the Mirage. The hallways looked drab and tired my room wasn't vacuumed and there were wrappers on the floor in my bathroom. I won't be returning to the Mirage any time soon.
50,Just spent 3 nights at the Mirage. In vegas for business convention. Stayed in 2 bedroom suite. Mirage is only casino hotel on strip with 2 bedroom suites. The suite was great. (little mold in shower was only complaint). Will be booking again soon. Great location. Had superb dinner at Heritage Steak House.
50,Great location. Good food and friendly service. Clean. Did not like the perfume that runs through the vents to hide the smoke in the casino.Would stay there again. This was my second time at the Mirage. Show the Love show- very good. Good food and shopping.
10,Very pricey hotel for what you receive in room. Didn't have a fridge you could store your own drinks. Small bathroom. Toilet was leaking and shower head barely worked. Would not recommend staying here.
30,The hotel and casino were nice. We were there for our anniversary the problem was there was a water leak of some sort which made the carpet by our room wet. The result was no hot water in the morning various Maintenance carts tools fans workers noise etc. In the hall outside our room for 3 of the 4 days we were there. Other than that it was good.
40,Saw more security than ever before😊  Loved their room robes...friendly staff and good morning coffee delivery. Minor housekeeping issue this trip but overall a great stay just as expected! Perfect Mid Strip Hotel💞🍾
40,Let’s start off with all the positives -  Amazing lobby when you first walk in. It was tropical themed and very impressive.    The swimming pool is massive for Vegas. It’s one of the biggest ones we saw whilst looking in all the other hotels.    The casino was amazing loved the Micheal Jackson and Seinfeld themed ones.    Good restaurants in hotels with plenty of choice for everyone    The hotel is in a good location on the strip    Friendly helpful staff    The negatives  When we first checked in we were hit with a big security deposit and city tax. I except to pay city tax but on top of the security deposit that’s a lot of money gone before you even start your holiday!    The cost of the bottled water in the fridges in the rooms is ridiculous nearly 20 dollars! Can not understand how it could cost that much when you walk down the road into a shop and it’s less than 2 dollars. There is no prices in the room so be careful on what you take from the fridge!    Rooms are very outdated and could do with a huge makeover.  Overall we had an amazing time and Vegas and would come back!
40,Awesome location amenities are great and great prices overall except the drinks (expensive) but that’s in all Vegas Walking distance to the strip is nice to enjoy the night life in Vegas and pet friendly too
30,The hotel is nice and clean. Staff is friendly. Check in was a long wait 30 minutes plus. The charges are a high for parking resort fee. The restaurants were expensive and not all that good. The Still was good and fun place to eat and hang out.
10,Wouldn’t NEVER stay here again 4star hotel was definitely not what it looked like. Bathroom was dirty and the towels that were placed smelled extremely bad I had to ask for new ones and the girl that helped me on the front desk was extremely rude! She didn’t even want to hear me out she kept interrupting and cutting me off not listening
20,The rooms are out dated and the service staff does a poor job cleaning between guests. All in all it was a disappointment especially for the price. The staff is friendly only when you are spending money otherwise they do not care.
50,We met friends from all over the country for a long weekend. From check-in to the restaurant and bars curbside service and room service. All of the staff we met were extremely friendly helpful and accommodating. We would stay there again in a heartbeat.
20,We were kicked out of a George Lopez show after paying front row seat tickets!!! We were targeted and discriminated against for being Latinos and laughing and relating to George Lopez’s jokes at his Comedy Show!! George Lopez is a disappointment to our Latino Community!!! A disgrace to our Hispanic Community He should never perform again!! His Security is the Worst and The Mirage is also a disappointment for allowing him to perform at their Resort. The Mirage Entertainment Staff should be fired for booking those type of low quality Performances!!!!
40,Mirage was very accommodating having our room available at 6:30 in the morning. Room was clean and beds were comfortable and pillows were great. Our room was on the second floor with no view from the north tower. I’d recommend asking for the South or East tower to view the strip. There’s a lot of ethnic food selections within the hotel. A lot of other high quality Casinos to visit all in walking distance. Great for first time visitors and wanting to experience Las Vegas on the strip. Mirage gets 4 stars because of the view from our room.
50,A Medium sized Clean Air Hotel with a variety of Restaurants and great value Shopping and outside Wildlife Activities. Easy access to the Las Vegas Strip and location is Central to all Vegas has to offer.
20,If you don’t want to gamble don’t come to the Mirage. It’s big and noisy. The hallways too. It’s hard to find the lobby. The room service selection is deliberately limited to make you go down to the casino and restaurants. You can’t get a cocktail to your room other than very limited spirits. Rooms are clean and nice however s d restaurant and bar staff very friendly.
30,The room was small and old. Headboard was ripped tub had rust around drain furniture was well worn and room had a funky odor. Little Vegas vibe inside. This has become a low budget place when there are so many better alternatives sad to see this as it was a better place years ago.
50,We booked a girls' trip to Vegas for right after Christmas and we stayed at the Mirage. It was a perfect location easy to get to/from the hotel. The staff was amazing very friendly and helpful. The room was comfortable once we got the air working though it did seem to shut off every time we left the room. It only took a few minutes to cool back down though (my friend likes an ice box for a room). We tried multiple restaurants in the hotel and had room service- all very nice experiences.    They have a heated pool that is open all winter (not the big one the private one further back) along with a hot tub around the path a little ways. The hot tub was secluded and relaxing the heated pool was a perfect temperature (until the wind picked up then it was just cold everywhere b/c even Vegas has winter).    The casino was great the slots were loose for the my friend and the tables were kind to me. The pit boss was vigilant but friendly which I also appreciated. I never felt unsafe or unhappy. Drinks were well made. The casino isn't smoke free (I don't believe any of them are in Vegas- expect smokers to fill all casinos) but the atmosphere was pleasant anyway and I went with a smoker so she appreciated not having to go out into the cold. This was seriously the least offensive of ALL casinos we went to as far as cigarette smoke goes I was extremely glad we chose this hotel after visiting many others!
30,Room is nice sized- stayed in strip view double queen.  Bathroom is small with towels that were really not up to snuff  Room smells like smoke and it is nonsmoking  Furniture was dirty  Beds pretty good  Resort fee covers really nothing that shouldn’t be free  No coffee maker in room but Starbucks downstairs with extra pricey coffee
10,Nothing was good the staff don’t help the security’s they thing they work for the police they cannot help whit nothing if you ask something you lucky if they take the time to look at you ...go spend your money somewhere else they will appreciate more for sure
40,Kids loved seeing the baby dolphins and all the other dolphins interact. We were able to catch 2 training sessions and saw some cool stuff.  The Tigers were very active so when we were there so 1pm is a good time to go as they sleep alot.  A lovely lady inside gift shop by dolphin pool does names in animal shapes. We have all our kids done from previous years but definitely recommend.  Because my mom lives there and was with us to show her id we got a locals discount which saved us 20$. Otherwise a bit pricey but worth it if you see what we got to.
10,There was no fresh air in the room and everything was expensive. The refrigerators had sensors and if anything moved you were charged. To get a usable refrigerator cost $35/day. No coffee machine in the room. Our son had water and a small can of Pringles before I could warn him and that cost $28. He called from the room phone a few times and it was $24 per call.
50,Great resort clean rooms great casino excellent restaurants and shows. Room size is great there is an iron and hair dryer in the room. Went to Tom Colicchio's for dinner- food was delicious! Had the prime rib and mash. Buffet for breakfast was great - many choices and never ending mimosas! Had fun in the casino at the tables - dealer was great! Had a very funny lady at the roulette table. Only downside our room was not ready. After a long day of travel that was not how we wanted to start our trip. I would go back though.
40,Beautiful hotel relatively easy check in with friendly service. Room was clean and attractive. Hotel offers many dining options and has Walgreens McDonald's and whitecastles across the street for some cheaper options. A bonus for us! Pool was closed a d we didn't use hot tub but Iooked beautiful out there.
40,Mirage is not one of the newer casinos but they have done a good job of keeping it clean and updated. Could use more choices of eating establishments in the hotel itself since there really isn't much around the outside of the property
10,"We found two areas of damage immediately after receiving the car back from the valet. They are denying it and even provided a picture saying it was their ""intake"" picture but the picture is dated well after the valet had the car and they only took one picture of the specific area that they damaged and not any of the other areas of the car where there are also scratches???"
50,Clean Friendly and Helpful Place! All employees were great restaurants were diverse and tasty and the M life program is good value. It is near the middle of the strip and we had a good time. I'd be happy to go back!
50,Easy online check in and very nice modern clean rooms. Casinoa allows smoking but didn't have the heavy odor of some places. Great ventilation. Courteous and helpful staff. i'll stay there again for sure.
40,Stayed in a hospitality suite for 3 nights. While it is spacious the hotel is showing its age. Old wallpaper and worn carpet is evident. Beds are super comfy however. Rest of the hotel is looks great and lots of food options.    Looking for brand new rooms? Not the place. Looking for a good value...go for it.
10,We stayed at several hotels during this month in Vegas. We stayed 4 nights at 2 bedroom tower suit.    Check-in:  -VIP lounge was nice and service staff are accommodating.    Room:  -Rooms were clean but very old had a bad odor believe its from the old carpet. Pillows and bed sheets were very low quality and uncomfortable.    Casino:  Compared to other hotels smoke odor were much stronger. Dealers were not very friendly several other people at the blackjack and let it ride table had the same comments  two of the floor staffs pointed incorrect direction for Uber pick up and restroom.    Ticket office:  I booked 1 adult ticket for wife through vegas.com for Roy's secret garden to take my young child while I attend IBS (buildersShow) This was actually the reason why we stayed at the mirage. I've tried to arrange everything early and asked the front desk when I could pick up the ticket and was told anytime. However when I tried to pick up the ticket the night before my wife and kid arrived I was told that since I booked through vegas.com I can only pick the tickets up at ticket office which was closed. They open at 10:00AM. Was also told to book the tickets through them directly next time to have more flexibility on pickup time. I was not able to pick up the ticket since I have to attend the show starting 7AM. After several turn-a-rounds I finally picked up the ticket at night and skiped the last day of the builders show to take my child. BUT it was closed due to weather condition. It took me more than 1 hour to return the tickets that costed $22. (best use of time)    Bell desk:  I had to use the bell desk 3 times during the stay and had very bad experience two of the three times. they were rude and service was extremely slow. It does not seem like they like their job and care about customers.    During the stay we spend over $3000 with the hotel its the worst experience we had. I recommend seeking other accommodations.
50,Valentine weekend getaway at the Mirage. Breakfast in the Pantry was excellent booked 2 shows Beatles Love and Bill Maher. Our 3 night stay was just what we needed. Only complaint is the weather was colder than normal for Feb.
50,This was our third stay at the Mirage through the years and we just keep coming back. The staff is professional and yet very warm and welcoming. Casino has all the action you could want and the restaurants we ate at are really quite good. This place is really a wonderful value and a very nice hotel!!!
40,The Mirage is a well-priced nice place to stay with a great strip location very friendly and competent staff delicious and varied restaurant choices. The Beatles Love show continues to impress. Despite being one of the older casino hotels it continues to be a great destination..
10,I was bitten many many times in my bed..itchy and red little bite marks on my body..i showed pictures to front desk .sorry all i got..next night slept in sweatpants and turtleneck..woke up worse..threw cloths away checked out .out of courtesy they said no resort fees..big deal..i sent fotos and letter emails to management asking for return visit ..a chance for casino to show me some customer service...instead i got nada..it was reasonable not to pay for room but no deal...i paid room and they said no resort fees..wow..i will never return to this poorly managed hotel again..i only wish i could post the fotos of my bitten body so everyone can see and prepare for what your in store for..my visit? February 16th and 17th 2019
20,Litterally bites all over my body..red spots..all i azked for was an opportunity to return for a better experience. Result.....SORRY CHARLIE. I will never ever stay there again..poor management and they just forgot what service was..they are in service business and hospitality. They kindly told me tough luck for you..lol
50,Close to everything. Beautiful rooms and property is huge. Many on site amenities do not have to leave the hotel for much of anything. Excellent resturants on site and entertainment as well as the casino. Will be back.
30,Hotel was just okay. There are better hotels on the strip for a better value. They really try to sell you everything in the room. The shampoo and soap were mediocore. You could here everything that was going on in the hallway at all hours of the night.
30,I stayed here for the one night as I attended a show at the hotel. I booked a Volcano view twin room. The room was basic decor is tired looking but beds were comfortable and slept well. The room was clean and served the purpose and thankfully I got this room on a special deal for the night I was there and paid around $100 plus the rip resort fee of around $39. I only stayed the one night because the rest of the week the rooms were $350 a night which are extremely over priced given the basic comfort of the hotel.    I would stay here again if I had to but not my first choice and would never pay more than $100 a night for a room here. The resort tax is daylight robbery as I received nothing at all for this tax or the benefits it is supposed to serve as the pool was closed no free bottled water in the room.    On the plus side check in was quick in spite of reviews I have read reviews that state it takes a while staff were pleasant at check-in also it is not smokey here like other casino hotels are.
50,We always stay at the Mirage when we come to Vegas and I have stayed at other hotels there. I love the size of the hotel. We especially love the atrium at the entrance. The rooms are wonderful and a great deal for the price.
40,I recently visited Las Vegas with my better half for 7 nights. We stayed at the Mirage hotel after finding a great deal through BA - The hotel itself is excellent.  It's extremely well maintained the staff are very hospitable and the grounds have a lot to offer:  -Shows/comedy acts  -Dolphin enclosure  -Siegfried and Roy's secret garden  -Huge Casino floor  -Various shops  -Restaurants  -Free fitness centre for guests  -Swimming pool (CLOSED)    The rooms are very spacious and modern as well...and the bed was huge and very comfortable! (King) I'll include pictures taken from our room on the 17th floor.    Upon entering the hotel it is very fresh and clean. There is currently a reoccurring theme through the hotel/casino for the Chinese New Year. There are various different restaurants and bars you can eat at although I'd recommend 'The Pantry' - it's a 24hr restaurant with friendly staff and fantastic food (generous portion sizes) - However it can be expensive to the average joe. For a main course and a drink you'll be expecting to spend around $50-$60 on average per couple. There's also a place tucked away opposite the indoor Starbucks called 'Blizz' - They offer fro-yo crepes and other treats. We got breakfast there a couple of times as it was a bit cheaper....but still 2 cups of tea and 2 pots of parfait cost around $28.  I'm not blaming the Mirage for unreasonable prices as you'll find vegas as a whole can be expensive so it's worth making sure you take more than enough money with you.    The pool is currently closed for maintenance however there is no reduction on the hotel service charge. The fitness centre is open and free to use but the spa (sauna/treatments) will be an additional charge and they also have separate areas for male/female..which is a bit strange.    As a whole I would recommend the Mirage as being one of the best hotels on the strip! It's very clean and staff are very friendly/helpful - I've always found customer service in the states to be outstanding. I would definitely come back to Vegas again and would heavily consider staying at the Mirage....just with more money.
40,It would be nice to have coffee in the rooms rather than waiting in line at Starbucks. Seems odd there are no coffee machines in the rooms. Breakfast lines were long as well. We went to other hotels in the area to dine at times.
30,The casino was clean and easy to get through. The property was centrally located & our room was ready when we arrived early! The check-in and check-out process was fast & easy to use. The room had no coffee pot & the fridge couldn't be used without a $50 fee. The reduced pool & hot tubs were only open from 9-4pm! They attempted to be environmentally friendly but they still have a way to go on basic things like having 4 hooks to hang towels so they aren't replaced every day. There was no recycle in the room or nearby either. The rooms were stuffy with no air flow (but did have a working thermostat).
30,no room amenities ie robe slippers coffee etc. I realize it was a standard room but a 4 star resort should do better. The staff at all points were very friendly and professional. The restaurants were average to above average. The food was very expensive for average quality. The casino was on a par with most of the rest of the strip. Pool was not open but it was very cold; so no problem with that.
30,The room was clean the bed was pretty nice the bathroom was clean and nice however the restaurants were expensive and charging for parking is inexcusable. I also thought that the food was expensive charging $60 for two people for breakfast at the pantry that’s not great
30,The food might be good at the hotel and the people are nice but we found it was cheeper to eat across the street  The doors are not very sound proof you  can hear people in the hallway.    the elevator you can hear down the hall
40,Friendly staff  excellent accommodations great value ! Many dining and entertainment options as well as great location ! Highly recommend for couples or groups ! Overall  exceeded my expectations !!
20,Don't waste your money! Find another property. It was the worse casino we played at during our entire stay - I never would have booked at this property if I would have known! The rooms didn't have cell phone chargers by the bed! Our phones had to be plugged in across the room. We arrived on Valentine's Day and we saw 2 cocktail waitresses in 2 hours while dumping money into their stingy machines.
50,We only stayed one night. Was a little hesitant at first because we’ve never stayed at the Mirage before and we only needed one additional night for our trip and found most hotels were already fully booked. I must say after our visit we will choose the Mirage first for our next Vegas vacation
40,We enjoyed our stay at this property but I will provide my honest opinion about various aspects of it. The casino itself is rather smoky but I attribute that to the somewhat low ceilings. I feel like the ventilation could be better. I did like that the property itself is not huge like some of them that take 15 min to walk from your room to the lobby. We stayed in a two bedroom Stay Well Hospitality Suite which provided a ton of room and great smelling diffusers. It was however starting to show some wear in regards to the wallpaper furniture etc. The beds were very firm but comfortable. The master bathroom was gigantic and the living room/dining room area was very convenient to have for our other guests to congregate. The interior doors (bathrooms and bedrooms) do not have locks on them though which I thought was odd and the master shower is completely see through as it is full glass. We dined at The Pantry twice (breakfast and dinner) and their food was very good and it’s the only restaurant there that is open 24/7. We also had dinner at The Still and the food was okay but the service was not great; also the television was way too loud to even carry on a conversation. There are two Starbucks at the property which was great. We bought items at the clothing stores and snacks at the shop by the guest elevators which was a nice convenience. We all really enjoyed drinks at the Rhumbar. The outdoor patio there was nice and the service was good. The Mirage is very centrally located on the Strip between Treasure Island and Caesar’s Palace and is across the street from The Venetian. I feel that we paid a lot of money for the suite and for everything in Vegas but we knew going in how overpriced everything typically is there; (ie- a large bottle of Smart Water in the room will set you back $18). There is a refrigerator in the room but it is stocked and all items are on sensors so you cannot take them out or you will be charged. There is a daily fee if you want a refrigerator in your room. We went to Walgreens across the street when we arrived and purchased a cooler for drinks and kept them on ice to save some money. Be sure to sign up for M Life Rewards to get cheaper room rates and use the card at all MGM establishments to earn points toward free stuff. In conclusion we would stay at The Mirage again if the price was right due to centralized location cleanliness plentiful restaurants and smaller size of property.
30,Highly overpriced for what is actually offered. Location is great but it doesn’t make up for the price. You can’t have water with room service unless it’s bottled water. The upgraded room is an extra $40 a night definitely not worth it.
10,Service was terrible. Staff was like robots could not address any issues. While playing at blackjack tables ratings where off on playtime and amount of bets. The staff actually told me every time I was done playing to check to make sure the rating was entered correctly. REALLY!! Because the staff has a lot of tables to watch!! Terrible costumes service.
50,Our stay at the Mirage was above and beyond our expectations. Alex J at the front desk is the main reason we were pleased with the customer service. We will stay at the Mirage again. Beautiful room great location lovely casino
50,Good stay need less pricey outlets for food and beverages.Great location clean rooms great service . Fast check in and we were satisfied with service .elevators were always quick never had to wait on them.
50,Everything was nice I should come back when the weather is better.The staff was super friendly. Restaurants had great food and the walk to other casinos were in a good distance of each other. Best non smoking hotel!
40,Stayed at the Mirage. Had on line check in and check out. Best way to go. Staff super friendly. Room was great. We had king. Very comfy. Rates were good but if I had to say a complaint was the extra $40 dollars a night for the resort fees.
40,Went on a weekend trip to get married....the hotel staff is attentive friendly and professional....I give the Beatles Love show 5 stars....the only reason I give the craps tables 4 stars is because nothing is perfect in gambling. Other than that....it was a very good stay
50,I HAVE BEEN GOING TO THE MIRAGE FOR YEARS. I HAVE STAYED A FEW OTHER PLACES BUT MIRAGE IS THE BEST FOR QUALITY LOCATION SAFETY AND FRIENDLY STAFF. A 5 STAR HOTEL FOR SURE!! I just had some family members stay at Mirage....they will be staying at Mirage now every time they visit. They have stayed at 7 other places before and said that Mirage is by far better then the others They loved it also!!
50,The Mirage is an outstanding property. It is being maintained in a great fashion. If you want fun food and excitement along with entertainment this place should be one of the top places to stay in Vegas.
30,They need to remove overpriced items in fridge so it can be put to good use as well as the snacks. Not really impressed w/ slots in casino. Prefer Aria or MGM Grand. The cleaning staff was super polite and friendly-always spoke when you passed by.
10,Hotel is designed so no matter where you are going you are forced to walk through the ashtray smelling casino! I felt I had been morphed back into the ignorant tobacco sucking age of the 50s. Pained me to see children in this casino that have no clue what damage is being done to their insides. Shame on you Mirage! Times are changing and you should too. You're killing people and for that reason I will never go back and most certainly never recommend you.
10,The room had very old ratty furnishings that were very dirty. The food at the buffet never seemed to change. Alot of it looked and tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for long periods of time. They don't even provide you with bottled drinking water unless you want to pay $18 per bottle. Unbelieveable!
50,Great location! Beautiful Hotel! Spectacular view! Delicious Buffet! Friendly and Helpful Staff! Highly recommend! Great Love Beatles Show in the resort! The rooms are spacious and very comfortable.Beautiful entrance to lobby and casino.
40,Not the old days when the volcano was mesmerizing but The Mirage is still a standard. Friendly staff. Good games and odds. Still has the unique pleasant smell. Carnegie Deli is great. They change just enough to stay fresh but keep the old feel.
10,Dirty rooms broken furniture and leaking windows in room. Hotel need a big renovation. Food was good at Pantry. Service at Rhumbar was great but they change how they make their Mojitos after the Mirage took over the bar and that drink is no longer worth it. Would not stay there again and do not recommend the hotel to anyone. My only recommendation is to just visit the Rhumbar.
50,Can’t beat the location of the Mirage! Friendly and attentative staff. The sportsbook is one the best  very good buffet and drinks were on point by the beverage service going around the casino I’ll be back again soon!
50,We enjoyed our stay. The room was very comfortable with lots of space. The bathroom was functional and clean. The hotel staff were all very polite and professional during our stay. Check in and out was very easy.
30,The hotel offers spacious clean rooms comfortable beds and is centrally located along the Vegas strip. The staff are helpful when asking for information however the popularity of the hotel means long check in lines over crowded pool facilities and very little personal service.
50,Excellent hotel and resort!!! Amazing staff!! Me and my wife love coming to the Mirage and any MGM property for that matter!! MLife is hands down the best reward program in Vegas will return for sure!!
40,Location can't be beat! It's just so central and easy to get in and out of. I also liked that within the hotel it is quick to get to the rooms. It didn't feel like never ending walking to just get to the elevator. Went in January so only one pool was open. I didn't go in but it was nice to just have some outside seating to soak up some of the warm sun rays. Our room was good. It faced the back which was kind of a bummer but no big deal. A few things - shower could've had more pressure but again not a deal breaker. I highly recommend.
40,Food in the still very expensive prices should have been on the menu taco dinner was $18 . It was good but expensive . The buffet was very good. Rooms were clean staff was friendly. Check in was a little slow but overall we had a great time
30,The room was not cleaned and ready for our last day of occupancy despite cleaning workers in the hall. Cleaners came an hour after notiifcation. Parking fee of $24/day higher than advertised. Disappointed with the Mirage this trip.
50,Overall experience great! People were very nicerooms were very clean and I enjoyed everyone's hospitality. If I had to choose again I would come here again.Food was great the clubs were awesome and casino!
50,Great smile at the check in counter. Also hope sekeeping was very friendly. I stayed in room 12110. Only feedback... there was no access to a microwave. Overall was an amazing experience. Hopping to come back soon.
10,Place is a nightmare if you dont want to smell cigarette smoke very poor ventilation and they force you to walk through the casino to get to other parts of the facility. Would definitely never visit again.
40,Lucky enough to win a trip for 4 to Vegas for 5 nights. Dates were fixed and 2 twin rooms booked for us.    Whilst I wouldn't normally choose Vegas for a family holiday the rooms were excellent and facilities were better than most for kids. Hotel has own heated pool but still a tad cold in Feb they also have their own Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat which my 9 year old loved (petted Dolphin). All animals have ample space probably more than in most zoo habitats.    For the Adults: good live entertainment and casino as good as others I have visited in Vegas on previous trips.    When booking please note that resort charges will be charged on arrival ($41 per night per room in our case) and a $100 deposit refunded on departure if mini bar not raided
30,The hotel was very dated I was disappointed with my room. The safe top was cracked and things just seemed worn and dated. I did enjoy the spa (although very expensive) and an Italian restaurant but overall not very impressed. It took me several hours to get a room assigned.
40,The Mirage has great location on th strip. It needs a remodel and they are doing things right now. If you ask for the Stay Well floor it’s newer and has new carpet and beds aroma therapy  air purifier and light therapy or adjustable setting for the whole room.
50,Everything I needed was right there. They upgraded us to a window view of the strip for a very low rate. You could not of ask for better service. We went to see the Beatles Love and it was in the hotel and a fantastic show. Wow it was unbelievable.
20,I stayed at the Mirage in two rooms with my family for 5 days.  Price is ok but service a big difference to the other major Casinos at the Strip.  The pool is also already a bid old.  For Breakfast my kids insisted to go to another nearby Hotel.  Since my youngest 3y old always played around with the minibar they wanted to charge me a fortune extra; after I asked them to come and see the real (0) consumption this topic was finally resolved but not for the hilarious priced water... no further comment on this but I will not return and stay next time again in the Venetian.
50,With M-Life upgraded from volcano room to a suite and all i can say is the room was super nice. And the stay was defiantly one to remember. The heritage steakhouse is the best one ive tried on the strip for steaks and good food. Friendly staff and lots of stuff to do.
50,Nice big spacious rooms with a great view of the strip. Parking should be free or discounted for hotel guests. Buffet was nice the omelette station was the best part. And free beer and wine who could resist!!
50,I would easily stay here again. Staff were very helpful and accommodating. We had a delightful time in our suite which was beautiful. The restaurants were great and the venue was able to take care of all of our needs.
30,Room had vomit on carpet YUCK!  Took a couple hours to change rooms and we were locked out of original room within 5 minutes when it took us 2 trips to move everything out from vomit room to a clean one again YUCK!  When we called to front desk to let them know we needed to get back in the lady at front desk was not very apologetic poor customer relations  Gave us a cheap 75 dollar credit for food and drink big deal! I would have expected better treatment from the Mirage!
50,OMG the buffet has everything in the word int it all sorts of the worlds in one room any picky eater will find something. The beds in the room we had was the best my wife and I never agree on the type of bed until we stayed here we both loved it and we got great sleep when we did sleep lol
50,Beautiful place with the friendliest staff. Our room was very clean and spacious and we had a great view of the strip. My husband and I enjoyed a couples massage at the Spa and it was amazing. The spa is beautiful and the staff is very friendly and welcoming. Overall a great place to stay. Our favorite place to stay in Vegas!
40,Our 2019 Sisters trip was awesome! The Mirage was a great choice for us. Be prepared to experience pricey foods in the retail shops. Veterans....this place is a must stay! The 40% Military Discount at Cravings buffet for yourself and up to 3 family members saved our trip...LOLOLOL! Seriously though well done Mirage well done! Oh and I won $150 the first night using my new card but they got it back the second night. It's all good...no out of pocket :)
30,An enjoyable stay with a typical casino “resort” experience. Nothing terrible but nothing extraordinary. If you want to save a few dollars and still enjoy a Vegas suite experience this hote is fine. If you value high-level personalized service and meticulously maintained accommodations this isn’t the hotel for you.
30,Hotel is an excellent location. Rooms are nice staff on par food so so casino sucks. I would stay again for the sole purpose of sleeping and being in the center of the action. Stay far away from the casino!
20,Ron White was excellent and so was the opening act. The room we had was less than ok --very run down and soap bar was unwrapped and used so was face towel. Soap paper thrown on sink was pretty grossed out by it.
50,Good place. Casino was nice and clean. Rooms nice bathroom could use an update old tub and kind of small. Buffet is not worth $32.00. Secret garden was awesome. Pool was closed for repairs. Transportation to other MGM properties would be nice.
10,There was nothing good to say about my stay at The Mirage. The elevators were dirty the staff was ok and the rooms were not up to par. In fact my bed had a hole in the headboard and the concierge told me oh yea that’s fine a lot of the rooms have damaged headboards. I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to sleep.
40,Not a great place for hot night life but a good solid casino with a great location. Great place to go if it is your first time in Vegas.. Decent restaurants and a really good vibe on the gambling floor. Rooms are nice if not remarkable.
50,I have seen many shows over the years and the show at Mirage was the best in quality and getting the audience involved and amazed.  Music and visuals were stunning with interpretations of songs incredibly thought out.  A must see for anyone looking for something special.
40,What can I say? I love this place! It is my favorite hotel on the strip. The staff are welcoming and helpful the service is quick and efficient and the rooms are beautiful! But my favorite part about this place? Their pool! It’s my favorite spot to escape. I wasn’t able to use it during this last stay as it was temporarily closed but they still had a smaller pool available for the guests to use. I just can’t recommend this place enough.
50,Nice environment customer friendly helpful staff great food  and very clean. Everyone in our group was very happy. We were there on a business trip  everything was perfect. It was a great choice for our convention .
50,We spent 5 nights at the Mirage with 4 other couples all travelling from Australia to Vegas. Found the mirage a great location on the strip with close access to the key places we wanted to visit. The Duce bus stopped just outside for easy travel. Staff were friendly and check in was easy we used the check out via the TV on the way out which was quick and easy. Overall great hotel would stay again.
40,Had not stayed at the Mirage since it was new. We were pleasantly surprised. The staff was very friendly! And it was small enough to find people and get around easily. Our suite was extremely spacious with a fabulous view. Our housekeeper was thorough and friendly!
50,Excellent Value Excellent Food exceptional staff at this hotel. I went for a convention and had not stayed at the Mirage ever before so it was a completely new experience. I found the hotel clean organized quiet rooms excellent food and staff was extraordinary. would definitely stay again.
50,We celebrated our anniversary at the Mirage and had a wonderful time. We love staying at the Mirage...great service good restaurants and fun gambling. Be sure to join M Life...the benefits are great!
50,The room was really nice and spacious. I also really liked the buffet. I enjoyed the scenery and the many different areas that the hotel had to shop and eat. I would definitely recommend staying at the Mirage again.
30,The Mirage is in a great location and is decently inexpensive in comparison to some of the other hotels around. However we upgraded our room for an extra $30/night at check-in and did not enjoy very much difference of the upgrade. Also our room door would not close all the way without force so we accidentally left it unlocked once which is obviously not ideal. We also had issues with the toilet not flushing easily and our key cards stopped working twice so when we went up to our room we discovered we had to go back downstairs for new cards. I would’ve been less unhappy with the room issues if the front desk staff gave us a discounted price after I told them the issues we were having. All of the frustrating things about our room aside we enjoyed the Beatles LOVE show the volcano and the casino and buffet downstairs. We visited the hot tub twice but again the price of a “resort fee” for $37/night is way too much when the hot tub closes at 4 and no other parts of the “resort” are open. We probably would not stay at the Mirage again in the winter and definitely not in an “upgraded” room. Again if we had a discounted price that would probably be different.
50,First time staying at The Mirage and we enjoyed ourselves quite a bit. Parking was easy in the self parking lot Check in was easy and we were able to get an upgraded room for only a small amount more which was nice. My friend stayed in a suite there and that room was very nice with a big bathroom and wet bar. I enjoyed the casino and we ate at the cafe by the elevators both mornings. Sunday it was a little busier but we were still seated pretty quickly. Will most likely come back again to see more of the hotel.
40,I loved the Mirage. Our room had a really cool view of the volcano that erupts nightly. And it's in a good location there's a McDonalds and Walgreens really close. Our room was clean and nice the bathroom could stand to be updated but just a preference. Lots of restaurant choices (avoid the buffet). And if you valet park you can park at any MLife hotel which is a great feature. I do recommend visiting Siegfried & Roy's Secret Garden at the Mirage - Siegfried was there and the dolphins are fun to watch. The check in process was good our rooms weren't ready but they went ahead and gave us the keys so we wouldn't have to wait in line again. They sent us a text with the room number when the room was ready; very efficient. Overall no issues with anything during our stay. I would definitely stay there again.
50,Knock our eyes out view spacious well decorated room. Wow was my wife delighted to be there as well. Nice layout service staff food air quality fitness facility and shops connected to the hotel. We had a great time.
50,The staff is very friendly and always good shows to see. The hosts take care of everything you need. The food at Stacks and the Japanese restaurant are great and the waitresses are just wonderful. We love our stay at the Mirage each time we come to Vegas.
50,We loved our stay at the Mirage! Nice room very comfortable bed! Would definitely stay there again! The food was really good! Check in and out was very easy and quick. When we arrived our room wasn't ready but was offered another room immediately. Great service!
50,Our stay at the Mirage was great! All the staff was friendly and ready to assist if needed. Our room was very clean and our housekeeper was amazing! We look forward to our next trip and staying there!
50,Great stay all in all. The beds and pillows were so comfortable. The rooms were clean. The hotel is nice and fancy. Wish they had coffee machines in the rooms especially for those who are there for work.
40,This hotel is great for the money! It’s big and very centrally located on the strip. Be warned the self parking is a bit of a walk and the restaurants are very overpriced. When we arrived the front desk staff tried to give us a room with two double queen beds instead of a king like we had booked 4 months in advance. She kept on insisting that there was nothing else available. After a little bit of pushback 2 king size rooms magically became available. These practices are common in hotels when they need to fill a specific type of room. Make sure you look at what you’re booking and stay firm if they try to change your reservation!
40,it was good to et away !!!  Ron White was ggo to go to but i wish he had done a new skit .  that is what was disapointing.  Parking was great walking to places was good.  food was great lvb hambers was so good.
30,Probably almost our worst stay. We were not treated well for vip customers. Our room had no view and was almost at the end of a long hallway. Only good part was the Beatles Love show. The super nice lady usher moved us to front row seats! I think we will stuck with 5 star hotels in the future ...on our second last day the housekeeping never even showed up. My husband had to chase one down in the hallway to get some clean towels....and please get your shuttle fixed!
30,The hotel needs to be updated. Not bad for the price not a lot of great slot options or restaurant options. The staff was friendly and the rooms were okay. The location isn't bad. I would've liked an indoor heated pool for the winter.
50,My wife and I came to celebrate my birthday. Our overall experience was amazing! All of the staff were friendly and extremely helpful! We could not have asked for a better experience then what we received from the Mirage.
50,As usual our rooms were clean the staff was amazing and we enjoyed our stay. We love staying here because we always receive great service from the staff rooms are always clean and the location is perfect for what we do when in Vegas.
10,I have stayed years at the mirage for business and have never encountered a situation like this one. I didn’t sleep or eat after being humiliated and singled out by their security! My husband and i were walking to the elevators to head to Or room when one of the security points is finger in my face and says “i need to see your is” shocked because they are ONLY allowed to ask for your room key once you show that you are more than welcome to go to the elevators which my husband showed him and asked what the problem was. The security  with an attitude takes my license and begins to say my information out loud over his walk-in in front of many other guests who were staring wondering what i did or who i was that this security and many OTHER security came to see what the problem was. I asked the other security  what was going on and the one who took my license with an attitude and cockiness says “you’re a suspect” i asked “suspect for what!?” He replied “we just got a call that you are a trespasser” after repeating my personal information numerous times he handed my license to the other guy which then repeated my info over the Wallis by this time more ppl were huddling to see what was going on and what i did! After a humiliating and giving it my private info  he gave me license and said “you’re good” i took my license with tears in my eyes  and embarrassed and headed towards the elevators my husband asked the security “so are you going to tell what this is all about and why you accused my wife of being a suspect for” he replied her cheek bones match our description” shocked and furious i said are you kidding me??” The other security says “if you have nothing to worry about then there should be no problem right” my husband says to both of them  “the room is under her name” i called out to my husband to just leave it alone and let’s go. Once in our room i couldn’t sleep i couldn’t eat  and woke up late to work the next day! All i can think about is “what if” scenarios! The next night i wanted to know how or what it was singled out when i went to management they didn’t know what to say he called the security manager and he made matters worse i left my number with the manager at the coney desk to have the supervisor call me and NO ONE has reached out. Thank you Mirage will definitely NIT be returning in August.
30,Older casino that needs some remodeling. Needs new/cleaner rugs. Rooms also need updating. You can see the paint caked on where they just keep piling it on. No big attractions in the property. Good placement on the strip.
40,Always enjoy the Mirage. Staff was great and very helpful. Room was nice just a regular room but it was very clean. My stay was comped and the front desk and bell desk staff was exceptionally professional friendly and helpful. My husband and I received a complimentary lunch buffet when we arrived at the hotel. Did mobile check in with no problems. Front desk was great when I lost my key and at check out.
50,We always like staying at the Mirage. Got upgraded to a higher floor with a Valcano balcony. Its a great location to everything but eventually the rooms are going to need some updating. I am not going to score them low because updating rooms is a normal occurrence after awhile.
50,We decided to spend the first week of February in Las Vegas to celebrate my wife's birthday and Chinese New Years. From the moment we checked in until we left our experience was excellent in every way
30,The Mirage hotel and casino was just okay in my opinion. The casino and restaurants offered quite a bit of variety and the hotel is in a good location. Our issue was with the rooms being a bit old fashioned not including a fridge coffee machine or microwave but instead having outrageously expensive snacks/beverages that if you even touch will charge you $18 for bottle of Smart Water. There's a Walgreen's right across the street so it would have been nice to bring some beverages in and when eating out you can't even bring home leftovers. We also got stuck in an elevator on our 2nd day for almost 5 mins. called for help and they asked for our room number but then didn't offer anything for the inconvenience. Needless to say we avoided that elevator for the rest of the trip which wasn't always easy.
40,we visited in feb 2019 and was pleasing to find very helpful staff and nice clean rooms.The only dissapointment was early morning gambling when the computers reset you cannot cash in tickets at atm and some machines you can't cashout at all you have to wait for attendent to get your money out.
40,We decided to stay at the Mirage due to its location to other hotels restaurants and attractions. This was only my second time in Vegas and we were celebrating my 50th Birthday. The Mirage was a decent hotel with quite a few food choices. Plenty of bars and the air pumping thru the hotel was ok. Right across the street from the big Ferris wheel and many food options. Since there was 11 of us staying there in 4 different rooms I was able to see the different rooms on the me floor. The rooms definitely need upgrading and maintenance. Our faucet in the bathtub would not turn off so maintenance had to come to replace the faucet. It’s one of those sayings “you get what you pay for”. If I ever get back to Vegas I will definitely stay somewhere else.
40,I have stayed at The Mirage Hoyel for over 15 years. The casino floor is not overwhelming like other casinos. The pool is beautiful. I really enjoy the restaurants in the complex. Friendly wait staffs and cocktail floor people.The spa is fantastic reasonably priced services. Try Thd eucalyptus steam room. The Mirage is truly an oasis in a sometimes concrete jungle.
40,The Mirage is probably considered a older hotel by the strip standards but I really like their rooms and customer service. The staff is super friendly and accommodating and they have multiple restaurants and facilities to meet all of my needs. I will definitely return for another visit.
50,We stayed four nights in a Stay Well room 1/31/18-02-04-18. We were happy with the floor and room last stay. We did notice this time that the device dispensing the essential oil didn’t seem to be working. We hope the Stay Well concept will continue to be a special experience. Love even after the sixth time separates the property from all others.
30,I have stayed at the Mirage at least a dozen times over the years. I have stayed in the small rooms Tower rooms Mirage Suite and better suite. They used to be the GO TO place on the strip. However they have slipped considerably over the last few years. I stayed in their regular queen room recently and was very disappointed with the over condition of the room. It was not dirty but unkemp upon arrival. No soap no shampoo.The head board on one bed had a huge gash in it. It was covered by the pillows but when removed was very obvious. I spoke with the front desk about the state of the room and lack of soap and shampoo. I was told they would send the soap and shampoo to the room but nothing about the ripped bed head. She just stared at me like i was making it up. The soap and shampoo never made it. I think i have stayed at the Mirage for the last time. That is a real shame as it used to be up there with the best.
30,I paid for a resort room. I was given a room on the 2nd flr with no view of the strip & I request another room with a view. I was given a room on the 11th Flr with no view. The third room was given to me after 5 hours wait was a resort room with a view. Bunch of bull ain't it.
50,The room needs some paint. Has no coffee pot location was great but you can hear people talking in the hallway. Also sounds like thier trying to get in your room when they're trying to get in their room.
50,If you want a great overall experience in staying in Las Vegas the Mirage won't disappoint you. Starting with a convenient location on the strip with good restaurant choices on the premises (and more than one option for morning coffee) our room was clean and well appointed plus we had a great view of the strip. Loved the Beatles Love show and the saxophone player in the Parlour Lounge. Plus great valet service and elevators that were fast and efficient.
30,I have been to Vegas 7 times now and as a travel agent I always stay in a different hotel. The Mirage was a major let down as I was very excited prior to my visit to stay here.    Lets start with the good:  1. Great location on the strip  2. Deuce bus stop right out front  3. Rooms were a decent size and the beds were comfy although the pillows were way too soft for my liking.    OK now flipping the coin:  1. Housekeeping was disgusting. There is a sign in the bathroom about water conservation and to hang your towels (which I did) and every day they replaced them. The beds were never returned to their original state with their decorative pillow in place and left over food was not removed. When I complained to the front desk I was told that housekeeping only empty the tiny bins and that's all (weird).  2. Wifi was spotty at best and not a secure network. It could only be used in the room and when I asked to print a voucher for a tour I was told it would cost me to use the business centre computers. Why do we pay resort fees again?  3. The casino tables needed more variety with minimums in my opinion. The two roulette tables I saw were $15 minimum whereas just next door at Treasure Island they have a $5 $10 and $15 minimum. I played the electronic game instead which I can do at home.    On departure I was not asked about my stay at all and the person who served me couldn't figure out my change even after we told her twice.    I expected so much more from a MGM Property and I would not recommend to anyone. Stay at TI way better.
30,Just average hotel. Bed was not comfortable and bathtub had rust in bottom where it was chipped. Would not be my first choice of hotels in Vegas. Casino was also a bit smoky. Location was pretty good.
50,The Mirage is a great option for staying in the heart of the Vegas Strip. I stayed at the MGM Grand my last stay and it was pretty comparable. Great location in between Cesar’s Palace and Treasure Island! Front desk staff was amazing at check-in/check-our. I was there for business and their conference area was amazing! Plenty of shows and good eats just walks away. Or take the monorail thing they have across the strip they have multi day passes that are affordable. Great way to get from end to end to see all the hotels!!
40,Slots pay was off better than other hotel. Quick response to service calls from housekeeping short walk to ride sharing exit unlike the vegas airport long walk to discourage ride sharing. VIP room well stocked
40,Great resort. Stayed over Super Bowl weekend. Restaurants are superb. Staff very accommodating. LV Burger has the most amazing burgers on the strip. Heritage Steak never disappoints. Try their desserts and ask for Ricki as your server.
50,We got our basic room comped so we were ready to upgrade our stay - it was a business trip for my personal small business. For $80/night we got upgraded to a 1200 square foot one bedroom suite. The view is great from the room clean and well laid out and in good shape. The Mirage the original first new big hotel in LV has held up pretty well.
50,"We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of a 1700 mile road trip. The location of the hotel is excellent being mid strip.    We felt that the premium view room was worth the extra cost. It was a great room and was very clean too. Our room was a long walk from the elevators being right at the end of the corridor. This is why the view is good as you are at the far end of one of the ""wings"" and can see in 2 directions from the room.    Can't fault our stay really. Room service was great buffet was great altough I felt that the breakfast buffet was a tad expensive. Price sfor water and beer in the shop in the hotel are ridiculously expensive but it was the same in all of the strip hotels we went in. There is a Wallgreens opposite the Mirage and water etc in there is much much cheaper.    There is also a McDonalds opposite and we went in there for breakfast on our third morning and had pancakes as we didn't feel like stuffing ourselves at the breakfast buffet ""to get our money's worth"" for a third time running!    All in all though The Mirage is highly recommended"
40,Only problem we encountered was the room service restaurant. Tried to order at 10:30 pm. Sat on hold for 45 minutes. Never answered. It claims they are open 24 hours. Never able to get a hold of them. Very frustrating with that.
10,Make sure you make a note of the prices of mini bar items that you take they charged me $5 more than the listed price for a item (and I took only one) and also PLEASE DO CHECK YOUR ITEMIZED BILL they charged me for the items that I didn’t took and when I asked them about this their answer was “That’s why we send a itemized bill” - what the heck
10,Decent rooms but worst customer service of any strip hotel I’ve stayed in. Staff and manager were extremely rude and would not help with basic requests. Room shower did not work and no help provided either had to take bath
50,The Mirage is a great venue for conventions with great rooms and meeting areas. You don't have to leave the Hotel to eat at great restaurant from Italian to Steaks. The staff is very friendly and efficient.
50,The Mirage is always a great place to stay. The rooms are comfortable  beds are really nice & the restaurants are very good also! I have stayed here many tones & never been disappointed after my stay there!
40,My experience at the mirage was great. It’s very convenient in its location to the things I like to do in the strip. The restaurants are extremely good. The staff is always friendly and very helpful. This is my third year staying here.
20,My wife and I booked a Tower Room King for a 4 day Super Bowl weekend 6 months ago only to find at check in that they overbooked and had to put us in a non Tower Room and would waive the resort fee for the night Wr had to stay in the room. Now granted it was Strip view and Queen Beds which resulted in my wife and I sleeping in separate beds. I was assured that they would call me the next day to provide me with a status. I asked repeatedly if I had to check and was assured they’d call me. Of course no call came after 2 nights. What got me was when I went to the Front Desk a super nice clerk Dariana understood the problem and offered me a $100 food and beverage credit that I didn’t ask for. I did accept it. What I simply wanted was an explanation as to why I was bumped and an apology for a non call. What I got was Jay the Supervisor who was surprisingly not qualified to deal with the issue at a major hotel. She didn’t seem to ever care or want to understand what I was seeking. An apology! They must get beat up often and folks looking for compensation and assumed that what I wanted. So then she offered to cancel my reservation which basically was the equivalent of asking me to leave. I was amazed that’s how you’d treat a guest. Of course I’m reporting the story so one has to believe me when I say that I was respectful spoke calmly and always controlled. The way I was treated has resulted in my first negative review of a hotel experience. I love the Mirage you get value for the dollar great location great pool clean nice restaurants best sports book in Vegas etc.    I asked Jay why I was bumped and this time the explanation was a piping issue Not an oversold issue. I also asked if anyone checked in to a tower room after I checked in and Jay told me she didn’t know as she hadn’t worked all weekend. What do you think?    After explaining that all I wanted was an apology I got one. Didn’t taste good at this point. What I asked for was simply that I be assured that on my next visit this not happen to me again. That is if I decide to return.    I’m not discouraging anyone from visiting the Mirage. It’s a great hotel for the price. And I’m sure like I have in the past you’ll get the room you booked. I always feel that you can be measured by how you handle a problem. These are opportunities to stand out and make you feel good about a situation knowing if something goes wrong you’ll be taken care of.
20,Stayed a total of 4 nights at the Mirage. Complained about air conditioning on the first night about it not working properly and no one arrived to look at it or repair it the whole stay. If and when I stay again in Vegas and pay over $200 a night (as I did not counting the amount of money gambled there) I/we will not be staying at the Mirage again.There are many other Hotels and Resorts that cost the same or less with much better accomidations. Thank you
50,stayed here 1/31/-2/5 excellent stay great interaction with all employees checked in early 1:30 no up charge. enjoy every aspect of trip from start to finish. Fridge brought to room for medication they called 5 minutes later asked if I was pleased with the service . Have stayed here on numerous occasions and will agin in the future
50,From the moment we were picked up in the Limo until the time we were dropped at the airport the staff was accommodating and our stay was fabulous! Not to mention I won at the slots and went home a winner more importantly.
40,The Mirage while being older still offers all the amenities required by most combined with its location on the Strip ease of exit through the North valet make it a great place to stay. At some point one the casinos / hotels will go completely smoke free but until such time ......
30,Just average. The location was not right for me. The casino smells like smoke most of the time. Even eating dinner at the Stack -which is an amazing restaurant you could smell the smoke. And we sat in the back of the restaurant. The rooms are surfaced clean. There were areas that had not been dusted in several weeks and spill marks were all over the cabinets. Definitely better than some of the other places in Vegas but I would stay there again. My biggest complaint is that is just didn’t feel clean. Just a basic hotel room.
40,Nice overall hotel and casino centrally located in the Las vegas strip. Rooms were comfortable but no room in the refrigerator for anything other than their items for sale casino was a bit more then other casinos shows were good shopping was limited and expensive for items the strip had for less.
40,Good property with friendly staff. Time to consider updating the bathrooms and offer more TV stations. Casino has all the options you want table games slots video and sports betting. Most of the staff in the Casino is friendly.
50,The Mirage is a great location. We were able to walk to several other casinos. We didn’t spend a lot of time in the hotel but when we were there it was great. We had the breakfast buffet one morning and it was really good. I would definitely recommend staying there.
50,I’m not a fan of mega hotels with casinos that go on for 3 miles. This place is just the right size you will not get lost and there are plenty of great restaurants. Check out the Beatles show it is fantastic. Play my Vegas game and you can get a bunch of free stuff
30,Corporate profits and greed are ruining what was once a great place . The average guest is nothing but a number. Not one employee on the front line waiters servers bartenders can properly extend client service . Either not enough of them or poorly managed
30,The hotel itself is average. Nothing to write home about. Casino and hotel staff are all nice. Probably wouldn't book again. For what we paid we would just pay a little more and try another strip hotel.
40,We loved the location of this hotel was so easy to get many different events from here. The staff was friendly and helpful the rooms very nice and bedding was comfy. We would definitely stay here again.
30,Disappointed in the Mirage as it is one of the hotels I have looked forward to staying at. The pool area if fabulous and took full advantage of it. Just lovely ! All the restaurants closed at 10 which I thought was early. No one has vacuumed any closer to the walls than 2 inches. We were lucky as friends in another room had mould on their vent. Bathrooms were very clean and nicely appointed. So a mixed experience. Staff were very friendly.
40,"The Mirage was a beautiful hotel near some of the main Vegas hotels/attractions and central on the strip. It is home to LOVE by Cirque (highly recommend seeing) Siegfried & Roy's Dolphin/Lion habitat (also recommended) & Terry Fator (highly recommended). It had a variety of unique dining options. The rooms were nice mine had an odd smell--not a dirty smell I overheard another guest say ""it smells like a hospital"" in the hotel towers. The pool area was gorgeous and BIG. Even though it was off season they did keep 1 pool and hot tub open which I was presently surprised by--many guests were sunbathing and the pool was very warm. It was nice just to walk back there and enjoy the serenity (plus a good photo op of the hotel itself)."
30,I stayed at the Mirage Hotel on a  “Stay Well” floor.  The Stay Well rooms offer mood lighting and supposedly better showers with treated water.  I’m very sensitive to hard vs. soft or treated water and this hotel has hard water - even if their “Stay Well” rooms.  The upgrade is necessary as any of this hotels standard rooms is not what I consider clean or comfortable.  The Stay Well is considered an upgrade however the upgrade amenities is minimal yet necessary.  The room was satisfactory.
40,Can’t use the refrigerator because it was filled with drinks you can buy and no coffee maker to use! Bathroom was a bit dated. Needs a little help hotel needs to not charge $45 extra for the use of the facilities when the pool can’t be used. They should charge 1/2 of it!
30,Many times in Vegas first time at the Mirage. Pretty decent location on the strip close enough to the middle. Not many amenities not many restaurant choices but they have about 3/4 in the main level. Not too run down but definitely a little older. Still clean for the most part. Staff was friendly and helpful but not over the top. I do like the mobile check in/out options. Super convenient to skip the lines.
50,We loved our stay here. Great room convenient location friendly staff. Mobile check-in was easy. M Life rewards program has great perks for veterans. Carnegie Deli had great food. The dolphin encounter is awesome!
40,This hotel is huge. It can be a bit confusing for first timers. The room was nice and large and several eating options in the Casino. The hallway outside the room could be pretty loud in the middle of the night but that’s probably typical of Vegas
40,The reason for the 4 stars is the bed in my room didn’t seem as comfortable as the last time I was here. Not sure if they changed to a cheaper mattress and the Buffet was subpar compared to most on the strip.
50,Las Vegas is known for being the most popular convention city in the USA but in rating the top convention hotels the Mirage stants as one of the top locations for business conventions. Offering great accommodations and restaurants.
30,We stayed in a run of the house room. Fairly reasonably priced small bathroom comfy bed and it served a purpose of being a place to sleep and freshen up it was clean. Nothing ‘wow’ nothing overly disappointing and we would stay again. It’s a fantastic location we had many fun evenings in the casino and it’s easy to get out onto the main boulevard (whereas some of the bigger hotels it seems a bit of a mission!). I sleep with earplugs so didn’t notice much noise around when sleeping but noticed the walls/ doors were pretty thin. We didn’t have a view of the strip but actually thought the view out over the city with the mountains in the distance was quite nice and probably quieter.    Only frustrations we had were that on check-in we were informed that we had a free Buffet each evening on check out we were told that this was not the case and it was actually just one for our stay had this have been clearer at the start we’d probably not have used the Buffet so much and eaten elsewhere (not because the buffet was bad just to explore more)! That may have been a miscommunication/ our understanding but something to look out for/ clarify when visiting.    We had many great nights in the Casino and on the whole a fun stay. 40% discount on the Beatles Cirque De Soleil show as well which was great!
20,Stopped over and over again trying to get to my room well other people who looked a certain way didn’t get stopped just a smile. Just felt like me and my friends where judged from our appearance. The whole thing just seemed unnecessary.
50,We enjoyed the Mirage very much. Fun nice clean place. The only complaint I have was the pantry restaurant. The food wasn’t all that and the $5. Cup of coffee was the worst coffee I had all week. The show with Terry Fador was great.
50,All staff from check in to food service provided excellent customer service. Visit the Pantry and ask for Maria. Mr Kim at check in was also Great! We couldn't have asked for better service during our stay.
50,Friendly staff and comfortable beds. The parking garage was a bit tough to find until you get used to it but it did have little lights to show you where the empty stalls were. It's an M Life property but because it is further north on the strip the monorail doesn't reach it to connect to other MGM properties.
50,The Mirage was an amazing hotel directly on the strip just a short walk from a pharmacy McDs and several other restaurants. Also the OTORO  Robata Grill & Sushi restaurant (inside the hotel) was incredible! Rooms were very clean beds were very comfortable (including the cot bed). Our adjoining rooms had 2 queens each and spacious with many mirrors (which was fantastic for the five women reserving the room). If you’re looking for something on the Las Vegas strip this is definitely a great option.
40,We enjoyed our stay at the Mirage very much. Online check in was convenient quick and easy. The Mirage is a beautifully decorated resort with spacious and very comfortable rooms. The biggest bonus is that the Mirage is home to the Beatles Love show which is an exciting and colorful show which includes the GREATEST pop music ever recorded. Boyz II Men also perform at the Mirage and they perform a great concert. The location is outstanding and close to some of the best resorts Las Vegas has to offer.
40,The location is excellent allowing you to easily peek at the Fancier and Bigger Ceasars Bellagio and Venetian. Beatles LOVE show is nice for all ages. Restaurants decent and not over the top. Cheaper rooms at Treasure Island next door but noisier and more worn.
40,Great location for getting anywhere on the strip. The hotel though not the most modern still offers a fun and well appointed experience. Good food options and a fun casino. The poker room is kind of sad but the Venetian is across the street. Only real negative was the rust around the drain in the shower. First class place would never allow that. Overall good value and experience.
30,We stayed in room 25098 during our stay and when I walked in the first thing I noticed was a pistachio shell on the floor and a cough drop on top of the counter. I left both items there during our stay just to see how well the room would cleaned. When we checked out 4 days later both were in the same spot as they were on the first day. The buffet was LACKING!!! Cold food crab legs were dry and hard to get open to eat meat at the carving station very dry and had no flavor. We also had issues with our M Life rewards and were not able to redeem the points we gained during our stay. When we tried to ask for help from the lady at the M Life desk was rude and very unhelpful.    The front desk was extremely friendly and helpful and made sure that I received the perks offered to veterans. The check-in workers gave an awesome first impression.    The casino floor was very clean and had plenty of machines and tables. Very few dealers at blackjack tables seemed to struggle with dealing cards correctly lots of fumbling with the cards and the chips.    If I were to ever travel back to Las Vegas I can't say for sure if I would stay at the Mirage again. I would put it about 5th on my list of places to stay if I go back to Vegas.
50,Very impressed with the state had a great time staff was very friendly  rooms were very clean  Overall had a great time the Mirage is in a great spot on the strip highly recommend this hotel and me and my wife will return
40,I’ve stayed at the Mirage twice and will be going back in mid February. My first visit was for a conference and the second visit was a one night stay with my 12 year old son (my parents wanted to take my son to the Grand Canyon so we spent one night on the strip before returning home). The check-in line was long but surprisingly moved very quickly. I am a T1 diabetic and they brought a fridge to my room for my insulin without hesitation. The customer service was fantastic. My first stay at the Mirage was in February so the pool was closed. My last visit was this September and it was still very hot in Vegas. Sadly the pool closed early for a private event. That was my only disappointment especially since we were there for only one night. We had a volcano room view and had a great show. I’m looking forward to my girls trip in less than two weeks at the Mirage!
40,Great to see that the Mirage has maintained it's quality and image.  The hotel is in immaculate shape inside and out.  Our room was recently renovated with a partial strip view sufficiently spacious with a very comfortable bed. I truly enjoyed the strong water pressure in the shower.....  My only beef is the cost of food and drinks as it is just as costly as airport restaurants and pubs. However the hotel's great location gives the patrons a lot of choices immediately outside the hotel grounds.  We truly enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back.
10,Gave our reservation away we had a king suite reserved and instead were told they didn’t have in upon check in and that we would have to take a queen suite. Keys didn’t work a number of times. Sink was busted we told staff and was never fixed. No fridge to keep drinks cold. No air flow in rooms they were musky. We will probably never stay at mirage again.
10,Rudest staff I have ever encountered. We spent a lot of money to come on this trip and it turned out completely ruined. Every bartender we encountered acted like we were inconveniencing them to order a drink. Similar experience with the waiters and waitresses. We will not visit this property again.
30,It is time for a room redo. The square bed pillows and throws are well worn and make me want to use hand sanitizer immediately! The bed pillows are weird..maybe a solution would be to bring your own pillow. On a plus the staff is always nice and personable.
50,The location of this hotel is perfect right in the middle of the strip. The rooms are large and beautiful and comfortable. Check in and check out are easy. All of the staff are very friendly. The food in the restaurant was delicious and a good quality
40,We recently stayed 4 nights at the Mirage in Las Vegas. We have a players card there and our rooms were comped. Only complaint is no coffee in the room and no real room service. Room was comfy and clean staff very helpful.
30,Mirage markets itself as an upscale property and upon 1st inspection the room looks great. Before continuing with that I'll mention that the customer service whether on the phone with the front desk in-room dining housekeeping or in person they are all incredibly nice and 1st rate with customer service.  Second the variety and quality of the cafes and restaurants are really nice. I sampled the California Pizza Kitchen LVB Burger Paradise Cafe and Carnegie Deli. Each one turned out to be a great experience.  Third I've taken in the Beatles Love show several times and it never fails to be incredibly entertaining.  Now back to the room. The initial view seems very nice but once you settle in and start looking at details it's quite disappointing. I made a list of every item I could find called the front desk and asked to have someone from maintenance stop by so I could review the items. The front desk was very polite but could only document the issues for later inspection by Mirage staff. A few of the highlights:  - Carpeting worn down to the backing (photo).  - Water leak and cracking in ceiling by window above heat/AC unit (photo).  - Smoke alarm hanging off wall (photo).  - Numerous issues in bathroom. One of the smallest (and narrow) bathrooms I've seen in any modern/upscale property. Rusted and worn toilet (photo) was the most surprising since housekeeping would see this every day. Not sure if they never reported it or if maintenance ignored it. The room was so narrow that the (worn & paint chipped) door hit it each time the door was opened too far. The general grime on the tiles light switches tub caulk and drain were really disappointing.  I requested that the room be deep cleaned and have maintenance performance after my stay and I hope to hear that things are much improved in the room I stayed in.
50,The services was good I highly recommend this hotel the only thing I didn't like was the fact that if you move our touch the water bottle they will charge the room with it and even though you did get it but other then that really good hotel and casino
50,I found amazing the level of service I received from the Front Desk Agent considering that at that time this hotel was hosting the Wrangler Convention and check in-check out times were pretty busy for the Front Desk.    The staff was so friendly and they actually upgraded my room to Strip View.    Great stay!!
50,I enjoyed my week long visit to the Mirage. The food and entertainment was very good. The hotel is centrally located on the Strip. Easy access to the Sands Convention Center. The room was very clean and comfortable
50,This was a great place to stay. Nice Casinos Clean rooms and lots of Restaurants. Also walking Distance to other Casinos and Attractions.The Volcano show on the outside is worth to see . And also The Terry Fador show was great.
20,Poor customer service all around. Casino and restaurants were great but room wasn’t well kept. Luggage department was extremely room. Didn’t realize $5 wasn’t enough of a tip for a “complimentary service”
50,The Sports Bar has great staff and Pam one of their daytime bartenders is amazing. A shout out to Steve Brozek in security who assisted me in a very stressful situation. A taxi company took off with my luggage and Steve took the time to view the hotel videos and get my luggage returned to me. Thank you!!!
50,Although I have stayed at the Mirage several times and always enjoyed it this is the first that I stayed there for an event that was held at the Sands since I didn't want to go outside to attend the event. This year I decided to brave the elements and stay at the Mirage. It was an excellent stay the walk wasn't bad and I am definitely planning to do the same thing next year.
40,Have not had a bad experience at any of the MGM properties and the Mirage was the same. Great friendly service upon arrival to check-out. Casino dealers and staff were friendly and fun. Penthouse Suite was clean and spacious. Stayed here due to location near the Sands Convention Center. Recommend staying here for that reason. Still not the Aria....
50,Exceptionally clean room and facility. Great customer service and awesome attractions and eateries on site.We arrived early on a friday and they made sure we had a room that was ready and prepared. Additionally we ordered breakfast in from The Pantry and their food was emmaculate! There are so many great restaurants at this hotel that you hardly need to venture out. While we did enjoy the strip as well as other parts of the city it was always a treat to return to the room and find another great adventure to get into! We enjoyed the dolphins and the tigers!
20,"This was one of our favourite places in Vegas but a few things kind of threw the stay off.  We arrived early prior to check in (around 2 pm). Knowing that check in is at 3 PM (according to their website FAQ) we were prepared to wait. After speaking with the front desk staff they told us that ""they would put a rush on it"" and to come back at 330 pm to check in. We came back at 330 pm and a different front desk staff said that ""actually rooms aren't guaranteed until 5 PM so we would have to wait despite what we were told earlier (and what is listed on their website). The staff member then checked the status of the room and said it wouldn't be ready until 6 PM at the earliest. Pretty disappointing seeing that we got three different times from different staff. After asking to speak with a manager the front desk staff came back and said they actually had a room ready and we could check in immediately. So it went from 330 PM to 5 PM to 6 PM to a room being ready at 330 pm. Im not sure why they had a room but wouldn't check us in but its pretty irritating that there were no straight answers and they had a room ready the whole time. Not sure if staff are confused or poorly trained but this left a sour taste before even getting to our room.  The bell deal staff was terrific (especially Rod and Billy). Very fast and friendly.  The housekeeping staff was also great but you should note that if you want to tip them you need to leave a note with the money or else they can take it (new hotel policy). This was another important note the front desk staff neglected to tell us.  The rooms were very clean and well kept. Accommodations are always good here.  Upon check out the front desk staff forgot to add our food and beverage credit which required a couple phone calls to clear up. Just another example of the staff at this hotel slipping a bit.    Overall I love the Mirage but there are some big gaps in the service now. Unfortunate but the way it is I guess. Not sure if we will be back."
40,Staff was extremely pleasant and the resort has the usual amenities. Rooms were pretty well appointed though found bottle caps on the floor. Dining options were standard. Rooms and dining could use an update or some freshening up (no outlets by the bed no lights in one half of the room).
40,This is a very nice hotel which is centrally located on the strip. Attendants did a good job keeping the casino in a clean condition. The only down fall was the resort fees added to the bill at the end of the stay of $37.00 plus $4.95 tax per day for a daily add on fee of $41.95 per day add on fee.
30,see notes  this was for our anniversary was just in at christmas and stayed at MGM grand alwas treated with excellance  until our points and lack of appreciation as we used Mlife reqwards  thank you .Mold in tub in bathroom  and sink was stopped in room from last guest when we arrived.
50,The Mirage is a great location and beautiful hotel. The staff is very friendly. Large variety of restaurants. Nice outside seating areas. Casino if very clean and well staffed. The room was very clean and comfortable.
30,Headboard in the room was torn up. There was no coffee maker in the room but there was a fridge full of stuff with no pricing that we were afraid to touch. Shower head needed replacing or a good cleaning as it had green deposits on it making it spray everywhere.
30,I would have rated higher. Overall a nice time. It was just disappointing that after a long last day I return to my room at 9pm to find it had not been cleaned. Staff did not seemed too concerned.....disappointing.
50,We went to vegas for my 30th birthday and stayed at the Mirage with 4 other couples. The restaurants had great food with the exception of the buffet which wasn’t the best. We had a blast and would definitely go back to the Mirage.
10,Under no circumstances please don’t use the phone to call home. They charge $24.40 a minute. They don’t tell you so I’m. They don’t tell you how much you will pay if you open the refrigerator or ay. They out to get you.
50,Great hotel. This is the hotel I choose to stay at each and every time I come to Las Vegas now. Location is great and hotel has everything I like and need. Spa services are great and Lisa Lee gave me a excellent pedicure.
40,My wife & I spent 3 nights there jan12-jan15th. we had booked a king suite through our travel points but when we got there they mentioned they had a convention in town and all the kings were gone??? but we had booked one? didn't seem to matter gave us 2 queen with strip view? no we were on side of building over looking pools and could see a tiny bit of strip we made the best of things as we needed a break from work.  the rooms was average  older style bathtub. beds were comfy. on the 20th foor.  Was not offered anything for them overbooking the king rooms my step parents came the following day they got their KING ROOM?????? unsure what really happened. I think the resort fees are overpriced and should only apply when pools are open not year round we didn't get the use of them in jan nor do we use the gym or spas.. so why the large fees. We have come to vegas from canada 9 times try and stay somewhere different each time probably wont stay here again. NIce hotel but for what u pay not worth it newer and nicer hotel in same price category.  Buffet was great for lunch great location. Terry Fator was amazing show. Beautiful gardens
10,The most filthy room I have ever stayed in and I was expecting so much more from a penthouse suite. You could write your name on the furniture in the dust. Sinks did not drain tv did not work no plugs in room. I will never stay it this hotel again. Smoke was horrible as well. Why are cigarettes still allowed in casinos? Do smoking and gambling go together? I can understand a room being dated but cleanliness is unacceptable when you pay so much money for a room you think is going to be exceptional because its a penthouse.
10,"First and foremost this is the worst case of ""Anti-Mark-Up"" I have ever experienced. I have traveled the US and abroad yet have never encountered an $18 bottle of ""Smart Water"" that sells in the grocery store for $1.99? A bag of chips and the other related items that would be $1.19-$2.99 in the grocery store were up charged to $11 each? There is no price list posted for same as who would ever guess that the prices charged would be so absurd?    Another member of our group was charged $337 for phone charges in her room? Her cell phone crashed and she needed to touch base with her family so I would like to inquire exactly how you calculate and arrive at the cost per minute and why that information is not posted either? Please reference Room No. 15044 Conf No. 787466850. Again this is ""Anti-Mark-up"".    Someone who forgot their toothbrush and paste inquired of the front desk if they had these items as most hotels do and was told ""No you need to purchase from ""Essentials"" so not even the most basic items one might need were offered? No coffee pots were provided in the rooms which is unheard of when traveling the rooms were satisfactory at best with rooftop views. Room #18057 reported the headboard on their bed was ""Shredded"" which is a potential health department issue. Further there were no shuttles offered of which we did note the other hotels were providing.    When in the Casino area is it not the norm to have a waitress serving drinks? All three times we went to the Casino (different areas) I never saw a waitress nor was I ever asked if I would like a drink or amenity which is advertised as being part of the Casino experience.    Another young lady in our group went to the breakfast buffet and was charged $30. When she saw the sign regarding ""Military receive 40% off"" she asked if she could go and get her Military ID and when she returned the bill would be adjusted $12. Her request was declined.    The entire group including our CFO and COO were shocked to find out upon arrival that there would be additional ""deposits"" required for incidentals. Normally on a Corporate reservation any of the incidentals would be applied to the Corporate card used to make the reservation? This put many at a disadvantage of having to use money they put aside to bring and enjoy shows etc. so if someone could please clarify why this happened that would be much appreciated.    I have worked and traveled with many a large corporation/group including the DoD for the Navy and Air Force. When reservations were booked under a Corporate entity we were asked ""Should incidentals be applied to the same corporate card"" the answer was always yes unless the person was making a personal purchase which made sense. You may wish to follow suit going forward."
50,Great Hotel. Friendly staff and plenty of amenities.Location is great. The burger restaurant has great food. They do a happy hour at the center bar.The volcano is pretty cool. I have been to vegas several times and this is my first time staying at the mirage. Will be back.
30,First the resort fees are just a way to make extra money you price your vacation and these fees are not reflected in your total. Yes there is in small print about the resort fee. Put it in the total so people who over look it get a surprise at check in along with an additional charge for parking $15 a day. Total $398.00 on 7- day stay. Don't get wrong I knew all this from the get go this is our 12-stay begining in 1992. The in room refrig. $18 for bottle of water and $15 small bag potato chips all shows how MONEY HUNGRY alot not all the resorts have become Pick one with no exter fees and have extra money for the casino play.
20,room was not the room requested walk to room was an unexpected 10-12 minute walk we should have been told that the request couldnt have been met with third party reservation so that we couuld make other arrangements!
20,Booked a room with a king bed months in advance to find out on the night of arrival they only had 2 queen bed rooms. When I got to our room the sink was clogged after and the shower looked like this (not a housekeeping issue they were the only good thing about the hotel.)    We had to go to the lobby not once but twice because our room keys become inactive even after not placing them next to our phones.    Also they had very limited TV channels with no HGTV discovery HBO lifetime or history channels.    Spend the extra money and stay at the Wynn they deliver what they say they will deliver and the facilities are much more up to date and modern.    The only thing that would bring me back to the mirage is the Beatles Love show and the secret garden.
50,The shuttle van pulled slowly in to the portico driveway entrance and stopped. Looming high was the volcano fiery water falls. The driver yelled loudly “Mirage Hotel & Casino”. Hey this is our hotel.    The check in registration process was quick and organized. After getting our room keys we dropped off our bags in the penthouse suite and were free to enjoy the the premises.    Our one-bedroom penthouse suite on the 30th floor had a spacious living room large dining room and private master bedroom with King size bed. There is LED-TV in the living room and another one in the master bedroom.    The bathroom was quite spacious with a double sink vanity soaking tub and a separate walk-in shower illuminated walk-in closet with electronic personal safe separate rooms for toilet and bidet and a sit down make-up desk.    Off the living room the refreshment center included a wet bar with personal fridge and mini bar.    The luxurious suite are appointed with dark wood paneling fine furnishings and artwork for the 1251 square feet place.    The pool is complementary for hotel guests. The open-air pool is heated with waterfalls lagoons and poolside bar.. We were able to use jacuzzis outdoor showers water dispensers and pool towels.    The casio has house advantage for all games. I looked around and did not see anyone happy or smiling. Everyone was trying to get even. I checked my pockets and I was still even so I went out for dinner.    During the low season the room rates tend to drop drastically WE ARE STAYING HERE... at the one-bedroom penthouse suite at the Mirage Hotel & Casino.
50,We were in LV for the Shot Show at the Sands Convention Center and the Mirage was a very convenient MGM property. The suite and transportation were excellent. We also had a party dinner there with great results. The staff was very helpful and the slot machines were generous.
40,last day get away thank goodness they had room we wanted the room ASAP and they gave it to use sooner than 2pm which it was good only thing is that you have to walk way cross the casino to get to elevators and same thing is you have to go to the parking lot but if you don't mind the walking well then they are great!
50,I was very satisfied with the location however I made the mistake of using the hotel phone to call my parents in Orange County to let them know I had made it to Vegas safely. I saw the bill upon check-out and asked to speak to the manager. I tried to see if she could at least make it a 50% charge since this phone call was made by me but the amount was extremely high (I am a college student working towards a Master's). She failed to sympathize and informed me that it was my fault for not reviewing my hotel confirmation when I explained that I had not seen any prices listed for phone calls next to the hotel phone. I know she could have at least shown she cared but failed to.
50,... Las Vegas stay at The Mirage. This is the fourteenth year that my friends and I have stayed at The Mirage for out annual gambling and fine dining weekend. The hotel never fails to satisfy. We'll be back next year too.
20,The worst thing about this hotel is the refrigerators are fully stocked with crap and they are apparently weighted so you can’t take anything out to store leftovers we had to throw away perfectly good expensive leftovers because we couldn’t use the refrigerator. Stupid. Would not return to this hotel for this reason.
50,We splurged for the hospitality suite that was recommended to us by the staff member at check-in. We were pleasantly surprised at the 1700 sq ft. space and the separate bedrooms. The main living room features a huge TV and sofa area as well as a massive dining room table space. We really enjoyed the spaciousness of the room. The entire hotel and casino is definitely our favorite in Las Vegas.
50,Hotel is located in the middle of the Vegas Strip. Great comfortable rooms and very friendly casino and sports book. Several medium priced restaurants and excellent upscale dining choices. I’ve stayed at the Mirage numerous times in the past and will continue to in the future.
50,Best location friendly staff nice restaurants. And Cassie in the salon is the best!!!! Good selection of games and the Beatles show was the best! Beautiful gardens and landscape. The Pantry is a fun 24 hour cafe.
50,The Mirage staff made my business trip enjoyable. The resort facilities and room were clean. All the staff front desk room service house keeping security and casino staff. Were friendly and helpful.
30,Stayed here for a week with an in town convention. Great location and easy to navigate. Hospitality suite was over all very nice but did have some housekeeping issues with garbage from previous guests in room and under furniture significant water scale on mini bar faucet so it had been a while. Over all 4.5 stars. Service and staff training for rouse with disabilities on other hand was horrible. Party member was unable to use elevators and had to use stairs due to medical condition. Would often have to wait for security escorts some times they didn’t seem to care if we used stairs sometimes they did and got a 20 question interigation. Had to wait outside in cold for 30 minutes one evening. Exterior bell hop desk attendant Tatiana asked why we were waiting there. I explained situation and that we had to do many times this week. She stepped back to her desk and other gentleman asked why we are sitting there for 20 min I overheard her explain to him why in a disrespectful manner with an eye roll to the degree I called her over and asked if there was an issue and got the “ oh crap they over heard me” response and she quickly got on phone to check security location increasingly disrespectful young lady poor training for those with disability’s......4.5 star accommodations 3 star staff. Shame on you Tatiana for making fun of those with disabilities    Chad Haring
50,Great stay in the Mirage Good food and great show. Bed was the best I have slept in on the road. Room view was a perfect shot of the Vegas strip. The Beatles love show was fun and well done. Good value.
40,I love Mirage for its location its stunning trees and waterfall areas at the entrance and the fact that it's relatively easily to get in and out of the room/resort unlike so many giant resorts where you get tired just trying to get out of them. The buffet is not as fabulous as it used to be but I like the Starbucks so close to the rooms (relatively speaking) and the location of the buffet also close to the rooms. The casino is still fun although it can be smoke-filled at times. The rooms need a new - sound-proofed - door. The gym needs to stop closing at 7pm (ridiculous).
40,Do you want a fair and best bang for your buck in vegas? Stay in the best location on the strip value is excellent service great pantry rest for bkfast.... buffet breakfast or lunch cirque love show terrific  Believe me your next to ceasers and across from Venetian short walk to bellagio and their great fountain  Have fun  Jimbo bateso
10,They stocked the whole refrigerator and everything is weighted so if you move anything to put leftovers in there they charge you. I wasted my perfectly good leftovers. The bartenders at center bar were very good.
10,When I arrived I had ask before I check into my rm if they can check my rm to make sure the room and bed was clean. I was told it was. When me and my guest got in the bed I found fresh blood on the blankets. We waited 3hrs in the lobby for 3hrs for them to change rm to that was 4 doors down no upgrade. With management in the rm I checked the rm and it had blood stained sheets and blankets. They didnt change our rm. We sleep with no lining and the rm was cold. They have me my $$$ back but I had to beg to go to the spa.
50,Love this spot! Great central location great rooms great service. Love the casino as well- Spent a ton of time in there. The pool was great- Lots of action but not too much of a rowdy crowd; just a good vibe. I had been to Vegas several times and stayed in several places and this is now my spot to stay. I am planning our next trip and it will be to the Mirage. Happy to return!
20,Upon check in we were asked to upgrade our room for $35 a night which sounded awesome because my husband and I would have 2 bathrooms. We entered the room and instantly loved it and were so excited about our 4 night stay. It was a long day of traveling so I instantly laid down for a nap after entering the room while my husband left to go walk around. After laying down I instantly knew that it would be impossible for me to sleep in that room because the elevator was right behind the wall our bed was on and I heard a wheezing and thumps constantly. After a few hours of tossing and turning I got up and got ready for dinner. While I was getting ready we heard a knock at the door. My husband and I looked at each other and knew that nobody we knew would be at the door and our privacy sign was at the door so we figured they had the wrong door and would leave. A few seconds later a member of housekeeping just walked into our room with their key. She saw me and instantly said she was just making sure our room was clean. I told her it was fine and she left. Why would somebody just enter our room when the privacy room sign was on? I called the front desk and said they thought it was somebody to double check on the room and since I upgraded at the last minute they may not have known it was rented. I still felt very uneasy about it! At dinner I spoke to my friends who were also staying there and asked if their wall was padded behind the bed and they said no. Ours was to obviously block out noise but it didn't work. After dinner I went to where we checked in and asked if we could be transferred to another room. The person I spoke to told us the only room available was another $25 upgrade and offered us no other option. We decided to stay in the room and see how it went because I refused to spend more money on a room when we already paid to upgrade once. The person at the front said we would probably not be able to transfer to a downgraded room the rest of the trip because of availability however they wouldn't know until the following day. Sleep was definitely hard the rest of the 4 nights I was there and we also noticed mold growth in the shower. I ended up having to take Benadryl to be able to sleep which is not ideal. I don't think we will be staying at the Mirage again.
50,Just stayed at the Mirage and we had a fantastic time. Check in was quick and the staff was outstanding. Saw the Beatles cirque de sole and it was fantastic. Restaurants were all very good and staff was very friendly.
10,While we are still here at this location we wanted to go for a swim in the big pool. When you read the website it only states that the small adult pool is closed for the season. It doesn’t state anything about the main pool being down for maintenance and painting. The management here clearly doesn’t care and spoke down to me when I asked him the why. He spoke to me like I was not educated. I was not happy about being distracted as I was simply asking a question. I am not done yet speaking to management at this property.
50,When visiting Las Vegas I highly recommend the Mirage Las Vegas the customer service was amazing being in the hospitality business myself I was very impressed a first-class operation The Mirage Las Vegas is definitely a place to visit
50,We love staying at this hotel. The staff is so friendly warm and welcoming. The rooms are comfortable and clean. The Casino is clean fun and easy to get around. We have stayed at several different hotels on the Las Vegas strip and feel this hotel is the best! We can't wait to return again.
30,Place is over priced and over rated. My first trip to Vegas and getting help from the concierge was like pulling teeth - it felt like I was bothering them. We had damage to our vehicle our day was delayed because we had to sit for a couple hours to get the issue addressed - I would have thought that would have been worth a simple meal for our time or $20 to throw in a machine. but nope nothing
30,"The staff was the saving grace! Gaming was like putting money in someone elses piggy bank- not even enough return to keep you interested in dropping $$$ in the machine-unlike other casinos we have been to from East to West.There were two condoms left by previous guest in our bedside drawer- YUCK.Dining-a little too pricey for the surroundings. I don't like paying EXTRAORDINARY prices for an ORDINARY steak.At California Pizza-It's almost like we didn't exist. We sat for about 5 minutes before even ACKNOWLEDGED by wait staff. Then after our pizza was delivered to our table we were COMPLETELY ignored. After we saw our waitress was now ""off shift"" we figured out we would have to flag SOMEONE down to wait on us. That is when he said there was a shift change. Yeah- we had figured it out when the waitresses hair was let down & she was sitting at the bar/counter with a friend or associate. He did not charge me for my one drink because I told him there was no point in having it ""now""- since we were done eating when we finally DID get it.The guest services valet bell hops-TOP NOTCH."
50,The mirage is a warm inviting beautiful hotel with a very friendly and professional staff. Once you walk through the doors the tension of your busy life just melt away leaving you refreshed and rejuvenated.
30,Our hotel room might have been on the list to be renovated soon. There were significant wear patterns in the carpet. The carpet also bubbled up in one area. The specialty round makeup mirror in the bathroom did not work. We asked for them to replace the light bulb twice but it was never addressed. Good hotel for families. We liked the restaurants and the atmosphere. Good location.
50,We stay at the M a couple of days each year. We like the fact that they are a “green” resort meaning they are trying to save energy. They currently off a $10 credit per day if you opt out of daily housekeeping. They also use a room key to control the lighting. Pull your key out of the slot before exiting and all the lights go off after a short delay.    The rooms are great as is the Studio B buffet. The hotel and grounds are alway clean. We’ll be returning again
40,Mirage is a great place to stay. We love the location. Their check in process is amazingly fast. Amazing food although we'd like more day restaurant options. If you like buffets theirs is the best for the money. Wine and beer included. Great drink service on the casino floor. Major drawback to this hotel is no coffee pots in the room though. Have to trudge downstairs to get your morning Joe.
50,Our stay at the Mirage was fantastic. The room was spacious very clean and nicely furnished. The hotel and casino staff were very accommodating for all of our needs. The restaurants that we dined at were surprisingly good and the service was excellent. We are looking forward to our next visit!
30,We are presently at the Mirage. Room is fine but wasn’t ready until after 4pm. That wouldn’t ordinarily be a problem except the only chairs to sit and wait in are in the casino. Not easy or sensible for those with with luggage. Literally no chairs in lobby. Very strange. We had to find the coffee shop at the other end of hotel to wait in. After 3pm they will not text you when your room is ready.....so you have to keep walking back and waiting in line -again-until your room is ready. This makes absolutely NO sense. If they can do this prior to 3pm why not after?? Big hassle.    Like many casinos the elevators to the rooms are as far as possible from the lobby. Unfortunately these elevators are also as far as possible from the car park. This makes coming and going during your stay a real pain. This would most definitely be a problem for someone with mobility issues or someone with a ton of luggage.    The room is a nice size. Comfortable bed and ok bathroom. Very typical hotel room. View out our window is fine as long as you don’t look down. The roof isn’t all that pretty! I wonder why hotels don’t do something about that space??    Room has a refrigerator but beware. There is a sign that says you will be charged $50 if you use it for personal items. There is also a note to call housekeeping for a personal refrigerator. So I did. The charge for this-$35 per day!! So if you want anything cold bring your own cooler or use the super small ice bucket. No coffee pot or ability to make hot water. So to recap: no way to keep things cold OR hot. What a pain to get dressed in the morning just to go get coffee after a night in Vegas.    They do a pretty good job of neutralizing the cigarette smoke in the casino. You can smell the deodorizer they use but it isn’t unpleasant.    We have stayed at the Bellagio and other local hotels. By far we prefer the Bellagio. The Mirage is not even in the same class.  Pay the extra and go to the Bellagio.
40,The check in was easy and they were very helpful! Terry Fator being right there was a huge bonus! Just wish there was free house coffee or in room coffee but Starbucks made up for that I guess... the rooms were great!
30,Been coming here for years and I think it’s time for a complete renovation to brighten the casino and get new interesting food choices for today’s foodies . Staff is very good but need a new younger vibe
50,The Mirage is an elegant and yet friendly place to stay. The rooms are very nice the staff is helpful and overall it was a wonderful experience.this was our first visit but we will stay there again.
50,I enjoyed my stay at the hotel and the room was excellent beds were very comfortable everything went pretty well except for when we went to check out I had lost my tag to pick up my car from the valet and was treated poorly due to the fact that I couldn’t find my ticket the lady at the window gave me a hard time I made a really big deal out of fact that I couldn’t find my ticket even though all my information was linked to my Room and I explain to her that I was the owner of the car in there for the information would match she still is proceeded to ask me questions. I was finally able to get the car
40,My family had a great time during our stay. Room was clean and equipped and ready upon check in. We felt comfortable and and enjoyed our stay. We will definitely return again in the future when we visit
30,Room 10037 Window leak  windo is missing one window latch.Toilet - running Shower head needs replacement MoldRoom was available for check in at 2:56pm Check out is at 11amI asked for a room with a view and got a room with a parking lot or cement area and 600’ away was the volcano view.
20,We went to Vegas for my 69th birthday and my daughter birthday card with money inside was stolen from our room! She was in tears as it ruined my birthday. The only people with access was housekeeping. It is sad as this has never happened before at any hotel in Vegas! Put all your valubles in the safe if staying here!
10,HelloYes i stayed at the Mirage from 1-14-2019 until 1-18-2019 and it was my first trip to Vegas. It was my wife's 50th birthday and are 25th anniversary. I emailed them to let them know how special the vacation was and they let me down in every way.. Nothing to celebrate the birthday or anniversary they had every chance to make me a customer for life and they blew it.... No flowers no buffet card no champagne no upgrade nothing!!!!
20,The public areas of the hotel were clean and at first look as you enter the lobby seems very nice and upscale. The elevator from an entire bank went down for a period of almost an hour with no notification as many stood at the 18th floor waiting to go down to the lobby. I did see some folks find the stairs to walk down. The shower was very very weak and the paint was lacking in the bathroom where they painted over major wall/ ceiling problems. The you have the resort fee which with tax exceed $40 per day. You get free WiFi and use of the fitness center. Since all the pools were closed and there was nothing else. This is an extreme rip off. There are better deals areound Vegas.
50,Beautiful Property clean large rooms quiet lots of places to eat. Wonderful Waterfalls in front of Hotel beautifully done. Close to all amenities and walking distance to Shopping Center. Reasonable rates you won’t be disappointed in staying at this Property.
20,We stayed at the Mirage several years back and really liked it so we didn't even hesitate to stay again when we travelled to Vegas a couple of weeks back. The front desk staff was very friendly and the room was okay if not just slightly dated. I left 2 items in the closet after we left and spoke with someone from lost and found about it a couple of days after we returned. He said that the items had been recovered and asked for my e-mail so that he could send me info for shipping (I had to fill out address and payment info I believe). He implied that I would get that e-mail the same day and the items could be shipped as early as the following morning. That was nearly a week ago and I have heard nothing since. I just filled out something on line at the Mirage so hopefully this second attempt will be successful. We ordered room service one night and everything just came in a bag--we'd expected to have everything served on real dishes and be wheeled in on a serving cart like is typical. This was a bunch of plastic containers in a paper bag. It may seem small but little touches like this make a difference overall. The other piece about the Mirage that was significantly different from our last visit was the cocktail service on the casino floor. We would play easily for 30 or 40 minutes and not have a server approach us for drinks. No other casino we visited had this poor of service so it really stood out. We expect to drop a bunch of money gambling when we hit Vegas but we also expect to drink for free while we do so! We go MUCH better service at Caesar's Bellagio Paris...you name it it was better than the Mirage. For these reasons we will choose a different casino hotel in the future.
50,Went for our anniversary and my birthday. Loved the location and the atmosphere! The Beatles show was amazing and a must see for all ages. The food and drinks are pricey but well worth it. The burger place (LVB) was great and the milkshakes were very good! We will definitely be back!
40,I go to Vegas yearly. I begin my vacation at one hotel and finish at a different one which I may not have stayed at before. I arrived on December 18th at the MGM Grand (4 days) and picked the Mirage to finish my trip on Saturday January 5th (2-day booking). The Mirage offered a Stay Well room which caters to those who suffer from allergies (in any of its diverse forms) skin-sensitivity anxiety or stress and/or are non-smokers. Upon entering my room I smiled at the ambient music which greeted me from the tv. Beautiful tropical fish graced the screen in real-time. You can change the TV to a fireplace feature if you don't want to watch TV or fish. I like the fish. Soft lights glowed from the various lamps. A diffuser sat atop the dresser near the bathroom emitting a soft pleasant scent. I discovered that one can control how quickly and how much scent can be diffused. It emitted a soft hum when active.The a/c-heater was next to the window and functioned properly and quietly. There was also a Rabbit air freshener unit which silently did its job. If you are a fan of white noise you can select low medium or high to your satisfaction. I think it had other features too. There is a device on the night stand that controls the lamps (that are on) from bright white to playful dim. The playful feature also changes the colors of the nightstand lamp while it dims the others. The only lights unaffected were the ones controlled by the switch by the door. All-in-all a spa-like experience.  The beds ( I had two) were comfy with equally comfy pillows. Closet had inner lights. Love that. I hate that booby-trap refrigerator that charges you if you touch it/open it or handle/use its contents. There were booby-trap snacks atop it as well. Eye-roll. The luggage stand was the only worn-out thing in the room. That should have been updated too to complete the ambiance of the room.  Bathroom was clean but not as large as I expected. <place sad smiley here>.  I purchased bath bombs from the Nectar Shop so I used that instead of the bath amenities offered. M-Life needs to change their amenities. They smell too masculine. Yuck.  The housekeeping staff were amazing as I would expect from any M-Life hotel - friendly with a smile helpful and respectful. I wish I could say that of the other Mirage employees. The ones operating the poker tables were mean unfriendly and uninviting. Get a clue - that's why their tables were devoid of ANY players. The young girls hosting for various restaurants/pubs/shops were not friendly either. They were more interested in chatting with each other. I didn't witness this negativity at the MGM Grand. Everyone in every dept and MGM store that I encountered was friendly and greeted me with a smile. I didn't eat in any pub/restaurant at the Mirage since I was put-off by the unfriendliness.  I would stay there again as long as I had a Stay Well room. If I do I hope the staff will be happy to be working there......just saying. Something is definitely amiss.  P.S. Is the volcano under repair?
10,I had a significant amount of cash stolen from my jeans in a locked locker in the hotel spa. When I entered the spa an attendant brought me to a specific locker to use. When I returned from the massage I couldn't get into the locker using the passcode I had entered. The manager of the spa came to open my locker and I noticed my cash and room key were missing from my pocket. The manager of the spa was aggressive defensive and accusatory of my situation and refused to give me a refund. The security guard he called was useless. There was no offer to look at any security cameras. Having money stolen from you is bad enough- the hotel's response was even worse.
30,"Everything was just ok...not spectacular. The hotel and rooms are looking a little tired. With so many choices of other places to stay they need to be on their ""A"" game. They c li early are not. Just a little attention to detail needed."
20,This place needs to update their rooms. The vinyl headboard had tears in it. How could it ever be cleaned properly? The shower tiles were broken. The carpet was filthy. Won’t stay here again. The lobby and restaurants were nice but they need to put more effort into improving their rooms.
40,We had a great stay at the Mirage. We enjoyed the selection of restaurants and the shows available. The Terry Fator Show was SPECTACULAR! A definite MUST SEE! Walking through the casinos we did not feel overwhelmed by the smell of smoke in fact when we first walked through early afternoon we thought it might even be a non smoking casino.
40,This is a very good hotel. Checked in early with no problem and stayed 5 nights. Room was large and clean had a wonderful view of the volcano and strip. Location is great! Would have appreciated if there was coffee available in the room. However it is wonderful value and would not hesitate to stay here again.
50,For me it’s always The Mirage! You cannot beat the location and convenience. The pool area is the best on the strip the Tower Suites are the best rooms with the best views the service is impeccable and the Spa is wonderful.
50,I was registered to stay for three nights. I stayed for two and was informed that my father was about to pass away. The front desk employee was amazing. She even cried when I told her why I was leaving. I wish I could remember her name. She was so sweet. The front desk manager was also wonderful as they waived all my fees. What a special place for me now. My father did pass away the next day. I am so thankful I was able to make it home before his passing. Thank you for being so kind and caring to treat your guests in such a way.
50,This was our second trip to the mirage hotel and casino. The service was amazing! They have great slots as my other half and I enjoy playing the games a lot. The atmosphere is my favourite part! Not too loud or crowded but still busy and fun! We will definitely be back
40,OK-this is a delayed review as my wife and I stayed here last April. I really really like the Mirage. I chose it as my wife was accompanying me on a business trip and I saw they had a pretty nice pool which I knew she would enjoy. We were not disappointed! The entire pool area is a nice clean little oasis for relaxing and leaving the craziness of the Strip behind. Room was very clean and it's easy to find your way around inside the hotel and casino. The only issue for my wife was the lighting in the bathroom could've been better for her purposes. It didn't bother me but hey I'm a guy. I was there for BEA/NAB and it was quick & convenient to walk across the boulevard through Harrah's (I got to know Buck & Winnie quite well!) and catch the monorail for a quick trip to LVCC & Westgate. For cheap breakfast there's a McDonald's really close to Harrah's where I would usually grab something before getting on my way. I'm not a gambler or a show-goer so I won't even try to comment on those attributes of The Mirage. The Linq promenade is a short walk away for places to eat and the High Roller is close by which was a blast! We were also able to walk not too awfully far to Batista's Hole in the Wall Italian restaurant located off the strip a bit. Gotta go there at least once. Some here have commented on the piped-in fragrance at the Mirage but I kind of liked it. Walking back into the lobby after a long day out was refreshing for me and the aroma was like 'OK you're home' (I know it's weird but I'm just being honest here). The only underwhelming thing for me was the buffet which was a bit disappointing. Overall a great experience especially for the pool and proximity to the monorail and various Vegas fun spots.
10,We had great Hope before we arrived it soon shattered after the door. Waiting in line to check in people smoking. Had to pay extra for a room that was an upgrade to have a healthier room. Floor labeled live well is floor 12. Now the room is nice and bed was nice. You have to walk thru entire smoke filled room....go figure. Had a hard time getting to room because of smoke had a hard time breathing and we left early before our stay ended. IF YOU HAVE LUNG ISSUES DONT STAY HERE THEY DONT CARE.
50,Hadn't been able to get back to Las Vegas for three years and was so pleased with our stay at the Mirage again. The food selections are great the Cirque show is incredible the lounge entertainment excellent and the spa and fitness center are an added bonus. Of course the gambling is what you make it!
50,Very nice hotel. The dealers could have been a little more personable but overall the experience was nice. Great food and the sports book is elite. Definitely plan on coming back for my next visit. Waiters/waitresses at the restaurant were very personable
50,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at The Mirage. The room was comfortable and beautiful. The location is great. The Mirage has great restaurants and the best shows. Beatles Love is one of my favorites; Terry Fator is talented and hysterical.
40,Good location and amenities. Free parking is available next door at Treasure Island and is only a short tram ride away (the tram was down for maintenance when we were there). The volcano show that plays nightly at 8 and 9pm is a nice touch.
40,Casino was clean and smoke free however the hotel room bathroom was not. We arrived to find long black hair in the bath tub and on the walls in the shower. Front desk clerk was made aware prior to check out and didn't seem too concerned.The restaurants were very good.
50,It was my third trip to Vegas and third time at this hotel. I really like this hotel it’s in a great location and the staff is wonderful. The volcano show in the evening is really amazing and everything you need is near by.
50,The Mirage is centrally located and still very modern and well kept. I saw Terry Fator the ventriloquist/comedian and he has his own theater on the property. There are nice restaurants and the casino is nice as well. I left several items of clothing in the room and the staff called me and shipped them to my house. This is the only hotel in my lifetime ever to do this and I was impressed. Dolphins and other animals on the property!
40,Love the Mirage for its location and quality. Great staff casino has awesome folks working the table games. Sports Book is great for viewing sports. Pool is top notch. Room prices keep me coming back.
50,We loved the Mirage. The staff were very helpful and nice. The rooms were clean and beautiful. We will go back! The Mirage was well located on the strip and we had access to a lot of events. The food in the Mirage was good and there were a lot of options.
50,First all -- if you want to stay put at your hotel -- this place fits the bill -- has several different restaurants open at all hours -- 2 pools with decent hours -- clean and well monitored -- a bar with happy hours at 1pm to 3pm AND 1am to 3am -- which covers EVERYBODY at some point during their stay. Shopping -- plus shows -- you name it they have it!!
50,The resort includes a dolphin and tiger/lion exhibit. Great for families. Rooms were very clean and the maids were friendly and accommodating. The property has a few nice restaurants and a lounge with fun entertainment. Had a great time.
30,We stayed at the Mirage for a few days on a business trip in one of their tower suites. The suite itself was very nice and spacious. Nice big windows to look out. I don't really have any complaints on the room. The hotel is just ok. There are definitely better choices on the strip but that is reflected in the prices. The part that annoyed us the most was on Halloween we decided we didn't want to venture off onto the strip so we were looking for a good place on property to sit and have drinks with some business associates. We sat at their sports bar the Still. There was no service to be found. We had to walk up to the bar to order anything. They were also not serving any food so we decided to order burgers from LVB. When we would order drinks it was like we were bothering them. Mind you it was only 11 PM and its Vegas! Their website says they are open until midnight but I believe that night they closed at 11. We were all in shock! There was pretty much nothing open in the entire hotel on Halloween at midnight except for the nightclub 1 OAK so unless you were dancing until 4 AM there was nothing for you to do there. We ended up walking to nearby hotels where cocktail bars eateries etc were still open. If you are on a budget Mirage might be an ok option but don't expect major action or nightlife. The casino is very dark and dead a lot of the time. They have some good restaurants like Osteria (new) but they all close very early. Not many bars either. We walked into Parlor which is advertised as a cocktail bar but it was honestly very awkward when you walked in. A big open space with just a few seats on the perimeter and very dark and not in a good loungy way. It looked more like the power was out or they hadn't turned on the lights. If you like a more chill vibe when in Vegas this could work but if you want a little more action there are still better options even at this price point.
30,It’s such a dated hotel water pressure in the showers is low everything is old and this place needs a renovation. But I was here for a work convention can’t complain too much as I didn’t pay for this If I had to pay I would and would go elsewhere.
40,Just returned from our annual Boys Trip to Vegas. We have been going for 23 years in a row...and for the last few years have stayed at the Mirage. The rooms are great the service is great and the location is fantastic...Center Strip with everything within walking distance.  The only thing that keeps me from giving this a 5 rating is the prices for food and drinks...which isn’t the just Mirage but all of Vegas...it’s gotten ridiculous.  Try the Buffet...it’s really good.
50,"The Mirage is great as it's centrally located on the strip and not so big that it takes 15 minutes to go from your room to the strip. The ""adults only"" pool is a nice addition as well and women are able to go topless-there are no cameras or pictures allowed."
30,Was average. Decent location on strip. Room was falling apart door was broken in closet plastic rod on curtains was broke sink didn’t drain tv stand that sent the tv up and down didn’t work and fell apart first try sending the tv down.
30,After Tax and Resort fees our trip cost us 35% more than expected. Lobby is beautiful location is great. Guest room Bathrooms are a bit dated and light comes in through window at all times so if you are sensitive to light there is no way to get a dark room.
50,Talk about a friendly staff! Esther at the front desk was so so so helpful ! She informed us about everything the hotel has to offer including where to get late night snacks and a good drink !!! She was professional and super nice ! Made us feel so welcomed to Vegas ! My girl friend and I travel all the time to Vegas and the customer service we received at the check In counter makes us think we will be returning here :)! Highly recommend !
50,This was a trip given to me as a Christmas present by my daughter. We had a great time. The room as very nice and clean. The beds were very comfortable. We did not visit the pool as it is January and the pool is closed.
50,We met our son and daughter in law from Pennsylvania and we do that at least twice a year and we have always had a wonderful time and especially because everyone Is always so nice and of course we really like the casino there!
30,"Nothing horrible to report but nothing was very good either. The rooms were a bit shabby the bathroom fixtures did not work optimally there was garbage left in the halls by other guests the check in service was slow the smoke in the casino was ever present etc. We did enjoy the ""yoga with dolphins"" experience.    We did not enjoy when the erroneously charged us for mini-bar items that we did not consume. The workout area was crowded and inadequate for a hotel of the size.    There was an intermittent squeaky machine noise that whenever I was about to call for maintenance it stopped. This repeated itself at least a dozen times. Fortunately it was relatively quiescent at night.    It is a good location though. I would not choose to return to the Mirage."
20,Stayed here for a week in January. Managed to get a free upgrade to an end room which had amazing views of the strip on both windows. Room was clean and tidy. No complaints with the room.    Hotel has a fantastic location on the strip right in the middle of the action so perfect for getting around.    Mi biggest issues were 1) extortionate resort fees of $42 per night which added £230 on to the proc for the holiday...for what? A bit of Wi-Fi and access to a cold pool in January? Disgusting really.    2) Smoke.....this isn't just a problem at Mirage alone but everywhere in Vegas really but the smoke in the downstairs part of the hotel.. which includes the reception the bars the casino etc was terrible and a complete health hazard. Unfortunately I am asthmatic and after spending just an hour in the casino area on my first night I almost ended up in hospital. Why oh why Vegas insists on letting people smoke in hotels and casinos I will never know. I loved Vegas but simply cannot go again as I will end up in hospital with severe breathing difficulties. People are smoking all over the casino and in the bars and just the walk from reception too your room is a health hazard...it's disgusting. I had to try and hold my breath all the way but very difficult when it's a 5 minute walk to the lifts. I feel sorry the casino workers as they are sitting in it hour after hour and being given cancer by no fault of their own. Quite sad really.    The smoke completely ruined my trio to this hotel and Vegas in general and as much as I love Vegas and would love to spend thousands in their casinos there is no way I can come back and no way I could recommend the resort for anyone who values their health.
40,Mirage rooms are starting to show their age. I am also disappointed in their lack of diverse slot and poker machine. It is evident they are not concerned with your gambling experience just looking for your money quickly and efficiently. Staff were very friendly and accommodating but with resort fees and parking fees there are other options.
30,The staff was very friendly and helpful. They assisted upgrading our room and getting show tickets. The casino was fun. Wish there had been more live entertainment. The rooms were a little outdated. No coffee/tea pot available. After visiting other hotels would have chosen another based on the activities. Didn't ruin the trip but would definitely try a different hotel when I go back.
50,I decided to spend a few nights here at the Mirage - and as always it did not disappoint.    The folks here understand what service means - and they go above and beyond to give great service!    The room was very good also!    Will definitely be back !!    Thanks!! Doc
10,Switched to 3 different rooms nothing worked had to check out same day. All 3 rooms where disgusting hair all over bathroom floor broken glass old brown tubs (just gross) and sticky side tables with drink marks.
50,Room was spacious clean and comfortable. Housekeeping was very friendly and willing to accommodate our needs. Restaurants were great drinks great service great. Casino floor/service was comfortable and fun played slots and they were friendlier than usual.
50,Where do I start??? This hotel ticked every single box!!    I stayed here for two nights with my husband and two young children. We booked a suite as it was very reasonably priced and was there for my birthday. On arrival the lady that checked us in greeted me by wishing me a happy birthday and gave me a special birthday key card for our door. The suite was huge! Had a kitchen area lounge dining table separate sleeping area which led to the bathroom with a keyed tub shower and twin sinks the toilet was separate and had a small walk in wardrobe. We was overlooking the erruptong volcano which was a nice touch!    The walk from reception to the elevators is magical and lively. Lots going on 24/7 from the casinos to the clubs. We didn’t manage to go swimming but saw the swimming pool which was beautiful and again very lively with fantastic music and full of atmosphere. We booked tickets to visit the dolphins and white tigers in the hotel. The dolphins were amazing! You can get so close to them and aren’t really restricted. Lots of staff there with information and were very helpful. The tigers and other animals were great too but I did feel they were kept in very small enclosures which were a bit cruel but my children loved seeing it all.    The breakfast buffet is huge and offers absolutely everything including ice cream and desserts.    We ordered room service the first night and the food was great. Called to get some extra pillows for the children and they arrived within 10 minutes.    Location was perfect! Could easily walk everywhere.    I absolutely loved this hotel and can’t wait to go back! (Maybe without my children so I can try out your casino and clubs next time)
40,I choose this hotel being a Beatles fan I wanted to stay for the experience Although staying here doesn’t give you any additional extras to anyone walking in from the street!  The rooms were comfortable clean with big beds. (Beware - don’t touch the mini bar unless you intend to pay for it as the items are weighted!)  The jet lag was a killer so the early 5am Starbucks was great!  Fantastic location.  For the money there are cheaper options in Vegas but it ticked all the boxes for our specific trip. If you can get a good deal then I can’t give any reason for you not to book!
40,There are no coffee pots in rooms. Fridge is locked and they charge a ridiculous $400 deposit to open it. Otherwise rooms are very nice. Nice range of eateries. Good room service. Great location. Nice casino.
30,Stayed at Mirage for 10 nights over New Year time Hotel is lovely rooms were nice and housekeeping was excellent also location very good. Now for the bad points....money money money. $400 resort fee...for what? What exactly are these charges for because we had to pay for every place we went in the hotel the Secret Garden some of the bars on New Year’s Eve there are no coffee making facilities in the rooms....is this because they want u to spend more money in hotel buying coffee. We went to Walmart and bought a small kettle. The prices in the hotel shops were extortionate. The pools were closed obviously because of the cold so we couldn’t be getting charged for using them. It was freezing when we were there snowflakes on 1st January but no heating in the room not even an extra blanket. I don’t need their internet as I use my 4g we asked to keep our room on bit later on checkout day charge for that as well. So can someone please tell me what we are paying these resort fees for we did ask only to be told “ unfortunately that’s the way it is Ma’am”. Stayed at Bally’s twice b4 we were in Vegas; resort fees half the price lovely refurbished room coffee maker definitely made wrong choice this time. Oh and beware of the well stocked fridge and goodies on top of it they are all there to tempt u just so they can get more money out of u......DO NOT EVEN TOUCH or u will be charged......
50,I really like the set up and location of your hotel . The rooms are a good size and housekeeping was very nice ! Had fun in the casino and liked your buffet “Craving” it had a good section and was very clean . Everyone was nice and helpful . I would definitely come back !
40,This was our first visit to Vegas so I have nothing to compare it to. We arrived around 9:30pm so the check-in line wasn't too bad we waited maybe 10 - 15 minutes in line. David checked us in and he was fantastic very helpful polite and professional.    The walk to the room takes you through the atrium which is gorgeous - fresh plants water beautiful. You then walk through the casino to the elevators. I have dry eyes and the forced air / smoke / freshener was really hard on them because you had to walk through that every time you wanted to get in or out of the hotel. But my partner had no issues so it was just me.    We had booked a king strip view room and the view was amazing - we actually overlooked the volcano and could see both views of the strip (room 19-084). The room was very comfortable - reasonable sized bathroom small sitting area. Ice machine down the hall.    There is a Walgreens and McDonalds right across the street which we used for snacks/drinks/breakfast. There is also a street crosswalk right in front of the hotel which was very useful.    The hotel is towards the north end of the strip but no trouble to get to the other major hotels. We found the location very convenient.    We extended our stay by one day with no issues at all stayed in the same room. Check-out was fast easy and convenient. Would stay here again.
50,Beautiful environment and really good food. Staff was friendly and helpful. The sushi bar Otoro was excellent. good time had by all!!!We will definatly be back to this property again. Resonable priced rooms. nice location. easy to get to Ceasars for shopping and Celine Dion
40,Second visit to Vegas and second time staying that The Mirage. It’s in a great location to explore the whole strip and the rooms and spacious and comfortable. We stayed in one of the ‘Stay Well’ rooms because I suffer from migraines and it was the best sleep I had in ages.    Casino is large and they frequently come round to ask if you want a drink.    Enjoyed the breakfast buffet too. Better buffers on the strip but it is a decent enough breakfast with lots of choice.    Would stay again!
40,I've stayed here what feels like 1 million times but probably more like 15-20 times. It's my family's go-to spot in Vegas. Super convenient because it's in the middle of the strip so not too far from any other hotel. Big clean rooms tons of good restaurant options all that you'd expect from a nice hotel on the strip.
20,"I paid almost $1000.00 for a 5 night stay and my ceiling was leaking (flooding the bathroom while we were in it). We called the front office and their response was sometimes these things just ""happen"". As a travel agent I have never experienced the lack of concern and lack of assistance. It took them over an hour to get someone up to assist and move our things to a new room. The sense of urgency was non-existent and disheartening. Imagine using the restroom and as you are ""handling business"" a gust of water falls upon your head! Not to mention we were in an ""upgraded"" room. We get into the second room and the toilet does not even flush... We were first in room 25-111 then 25-125! For that we could've stayed in a regular room."
20,Sadly the Mirage is going down hill our room wasn't very clean (hair on floor and in tub in bathroom) beds uncomfortable and stained linens. Cravings buffet wasn't very good at all crab legs were pencil sized and sushi was horrible. However the worst thing is Mlife rewards you get none when betting sports! In addition you have to place a $500 bet for 1 free drink that's insane! I come to Vegas 3/4 times per year and until thet give sportsbook comps I'm not staying at a MGM property!
30,There some issues with the hotel that were kind of disappointing ie: duct tape holding a panel closed in an elevator mildew in the shower. I did get a really good deal on the room so to a certain degree it’s forgivable but if I was staying when rates are above $200 then I’d be pissed!The Mirage also hosts an awesome Dolphin trainer for a day experience that is worth it and the best part of the hotel (you don’t have to be a guest at the hotel to do the dolphin trainer for a day experience).The Pantry has really good pancakes!The Cravings buffet is decent...
20,We arrived at 4.15 pm which is a good hour and 15 minutes after check in time to be told that our room wasn't ready and they would email us when it was but it shouldn't be any more than half an hour. At 4.55 I went back to the desk to see what was going on and the gentleman said he would get us a room which was better than the one we had booked (still a strip view room but on a higher floor). To say it was a strip view was stretching it a bit as we had a great view of a roof with all its air conditioning pipes and the car park for the hotel next door. You could see the strip in the distance but not enough to get enthused about. This is the first hotel in the world I have stayed in that doesn't have tea and coffee making facilities in it but it does have a well stocked minibar fridge. So well stocked in fact that we had to take a couple of bottles of beer out of it so we could fit our bottles of water in to cool overnight only then to be charged for the beer. When we explained to the desk we had not drunk the beer and what we had done we were told you're not supposed to do that. If you want to cool your water you have to rent a fridge at $35 a day. These things along with the $42 per day resort fees (something you only pay in Vegas hotels) left a very sour taste in our mouths about the hotel.
50,We had a great time at the mirage and the dealers were so nice Alum Sonya and John were patient and welcoming. We stayed 3 days and wished it was more the check in was fast and easy.The grounds were clean lush and was very good value.The buffet Cravings was ok not great the staff was not helpful there I was trying to find a fork but that's alright.The room was average no fridge and the main issue with the stay was the goobs of somewone s hair all stuck on shower wall. I didn't complain about it because everything was great we all had fun and liked the experience and would recommend this hotel again
50,Couldn't have been cleaner friendlier or more comfy. I loved everything about the Mirage. The beds were incredible. i am very fussy about my pillow and there were four choices on each bed. The aquarium at the check in counter was amazing.
10,The mirage is mostly reviewed as a family friendly hotel in Las Vegas. However while traveling with five children my experience was anything but kid friendly. I personally talked to four different reservation specialist before our trip I explained to each that we were requesting two rooms to be connected with a door because the old children would staying in one room while I stay with the younger children in the other room. Not one of the four specialist told me of the hidden $60 fee to make sure the rooms were connected. Only until I was there was the charger brought up. My room had a hair brush left in the drawer and the windows open and one of the locks was broken off in the children room. There is a $50 charger to use the rooms only refrigerator. After I explained all my complaints I was told nothing could be done for my type of complaints. Will never stay at the Mirage or any other MLife hotel in Las Vegas.
20,For the most part the people who work there were nice and helpful. The maid service to one of our two rooms was terrible the other was fine. I had plans to get comped for our fourth night were shut down and wound up costing me.
10,Found leftover food in the mini bar. It was very disgusting. The mini bar was not refilled so we were charged for the drinks taken by the previous guest. Our cheese cakes were taken out from the fridge and just left on the counter.
50,I always read reviews and try to educate myself with the information included. Of course many reviews have to be taken with a grain of salt. I am doing my best to leave factual and unbiased information. That being said - for us the Mirage was Excellent. We chose the Resort King Tower room - just slightly higher than the run of the house and still a bargain by Vegas standards. We enjoyed having special elevators for the 24th and 25th floors only. The room was nice and clean and spacious. The view we had allowed us to see the strip and the mountains. The small closets by the bed were plenty for the two of us and the bathroom was fantastic with the huge vanity and double sinks and the lighted makeup mirror. There are no outlets right by the bed but there are plenty of all sorts on the desk area. On advice of the desk staff (Victoria who was amazingly friendly) we did not touch the refrigerator or the snack tray. No problem at all as there were places aplenty to purchase water snacks and to get free ice if needed. We knew there would be no coffee maker - no worries. We ordered a box of coffee on rising each morning from the Pantry and it was delivered to us lickity split. Even adding the cost of the coffee - the room charge is a bargain. The only noises we heard were guests letting their door slam shut - even that we didn't hear at night. The bed was comfortable too. We dined at the Pantry which was super yummy. Everything we ate there was great! We also ate at the California Pizza Kitchen and the LVB Burger. Those were very good as well. All the staff was courteous and extra friendly. The casino and lobby areas smelled fresh and tropical. The only smoky area was the sports bar which is to be expected during NFL Playoffs. I can't think of a thing that needed improvement. I was very impressed and will definitely return to the Mirage.
50,When you get to the MIRAGE you have to find one of the nicest people your ever going to meet TERRY at the slots. She can really can make your day better with her smile and her jokes are great. She been a beverage server for over twenty years but loves her job and is a very positive member of the Mirage staff.
50,Tom Colicchio’s Heritage Steak House - Wonderful flavors in all the food we ordered! Excellent filet rib eye mashed potatoes...great service where dishes were delivered removed water refilled and we never lost a beat in our conversation. Very much appreciated to not be interrupted yet have the meal and drinks appear seamlessly.    LVB - Fabulous bacon cheeseburgers and salads. Efficient and friendly servers. Great quick meal before a show.    Pantry - Breakfast server Christian is a kick in the pants (great sense of humor) fabulous fluffy pancakes scrumptious Apple Smoked Bacon and large omelettes. Coffee stays hot in the carafe.    Rhumbar - Great service and even better drinks. Excellent Margaritas and Whiskey Sours.    LOVE - Saw it for the 4th time and the technical updates from the 10th anniversary are fabulous. 6 speakers in every seat. My fave seats are Section 200 Row P Seats 1-4 though there really isn’t a bad seat in the theatre.    I can’t say enough good things about the management team - someone in particular bent over backwards for me to make this trip a memorable one. I’ll remember his kindness forever and be true to The Mirage for as long as I travel to Vegas.
50,Mirage staff always goes over and beyond for us. We have stayed at the mirage for more than 10 years we love it. We’ve stayed at other properties but the mirage is the very best on the strip to us. You definitely won’t be disappointed. Kenjo Kelley
40,Our family enjoyed a wonderful 4 nights stay. We had a two large and comfortable Volcano view room on the 14th floor with good facilities. The hotel is located is perfect position with the Venetian just across the road and within easy walking to the Bellagio Caesars Palace etc. with easy access to the Fashion Show shopping mall via Treasure Island Casino.
30,I booked my rooms together in advance. I checked in via the app early in the morning. I followed up with a phone call to confirm my check in and was told both rooms were successfully checked in. I arrived and was told that only one room was checked in. I was given my room keys and was told that one was a bit higher than the other. It was an inconvenience because we had children with us but they told me thats all that was left. Then they told me that one was a different view from the other. I reserved the exact same room for both so why were they different? The worker came back and said never mind they both have the same view. We go to the elevators and realize that not only are the rooms on two separate floors but in two different buildings! Then I got to the rooms and realized they were not the view that I had reserved so she basically lied to hush me up and send me on my way. I was upset and brought it up and was brushed off like thats what there is so too bad. I did not let it ruin my trip but I was irritated. Then while on the casino floor I was never offered a drink during the 4 days I was there. I had to hunt down the waitress to make an order. The housekeeping staff was excellent and attentive.
50,Great time at the Mirage! Staff was excellent the only issue was my rug in my room could be vacuumed better. I would recommend the hotel and being right in the thick of the strip is also desirable for me.
50,An excellent vacation spot for the New Years celebration .We had a good view of the fireworks from right outside the Mirage crowded but a good spot. A lot of great restaurants and a good sports betting parlor.
50,This was a special trip for my family.    This was a trip our father has promised my brothers and I since we were little kids.    We had a hospitality suite on the 22 floor with an additional bedroom attached on. It was absolutely incredible. Suite was cleaned whenever we asked. Service is absolutely incredible at The Mirage - they truly try to make you feel at home.    Any type of trip to Vegas - I would recco the Mirage
50,A happy new year surprise. The fireworks were spectacular to watch from the Mirage. Well worth braving the cold weather! We enjoyed the resturants  gambling and location at the Mirage. Will definitely visit again.
40,Staff was amazing front desk crew was awesome and friendly. Suite was gorgeous. Lack of any entertainment if the club in hotel is not open on the particular day of your stay. I ended up having to walk next door to find something to do besides gamble.
30,Stayed on the 14th floor. Room was tired. Bathroom was really tired so much so that it was hard to determine if it was dirty or just dilapidated. Love the location of the Mirage. Parking was convenient and well lit.
40,We enjoyed our stay at the Mirage. We like to stay at different Casinos each time we visit. We would for sure stay there again. Being right in the middle of all the attractions. The only downside was when we checked in (on my Birthday) they said there was nothing special they could do. I mean NOTHING. Hard to believe with all the money they bring in. Overall it was a very nice place and the rooms were pleasant.
50,The Mirage continues to provide a great location and great service to their guest. We had a great time and great experience during our stay. The casino is fun and I feel very comfortable at the Mirage.
50,This was our first trip to Las Vegas. My wife and I loved the hotel appearance and location! The staff was all very courteous and helpful! They were able to answer all questions/concerns that we had. I recommend a room with a volcano or strip view!
50,We used mobile check-in so skipped the long queue Be confident-you will not be on your own. Joey at the mobile desk cheerfully adjusted our rooms to be across rather than way down the hall as initially assigned.    Stay well floor 12 - book for sure all renovated rooms fresh air filters  volcano view rooms if you like.  We ate at California Pizza kitchen-Rocky gave us great fun service. Wild mushroom pizza was delicious.    Otoro for sushi and robota. Againservice was terrific. Pauline’s suggestions added greatly to our experience.    Never seemed smoky public areas clean. We will stay again.
50,The Mirage is now one of the oldest hotels on the strip yet it has maintained its first class service and products. We felt like we did not need to visit other hotels because this hotel has it all. We loved the spa area and the staff are wonderful.
50,excellent and amazing experience. The cleanliness was also very good and satisfying. I really appreciate the staff help in providing me the room when my flight got delayed. Thank you so much for all your help and wonderful experience that you have given me at Mirage !!
40,Love the Mirage because it is near center strip where we like to be. Lot's of stuff going on and good gambling in many locations. The hotel is pretty well maintained and the room rates are occasionally reasonable.
30,Our stay was for 2 day after new year first of all encountered misguided with watchman/guard about the property as this is not mirage resort its only casino after spending 45 min on road and calling them finally landed on same location as precious one then other hardle came as long queue for check in in was again almost more then half hour standing with children and luggage.no place to sit around you have to park in self park area and then bring your stuff through parking lot till hotel reception and then in room. we stay in 16107 informed us earlier that its strip facing room but it was not.room was modren style but not aspect basic amenities like microwave and fridge and if you ask for hot water as i needed for my baby milk they said i have to pay for that also. Need mini fridge pay for it also.then washroom there is pic attached of clean towel with some red stain over it. Serious concern about hygienic point of you after that.After that when we want to go outside the hotel car parking card not workingguard said we have to go back to reception in ling queue again yo solve this issue once we come back to hotel again.our all i will not prefer this hotel again for my stay.specially after that dirty towel
40,I've stayed at Treasure Island Flamingo and MGM Grand over the years. MGM Grand was so big it was a pain to walk around or even find out how to get out of the hotel. That's why we picked the Mirage this time. It's midsized. Rooms were a good size but had no plug next to the bed which is a must nowadays. Poker room is a nice place to play. Tried LVB Burger Carnegie and Cravings Buffet. Didn't care for the first two - overpriced and mediocre food - and the buffet was just okay. We ate there twice for convenience but the selection was small but they get points for included beer & wine. They must have known I was up late playing poker because when I got back to room they sent me email asking if I would like to check out later. Yes I did! $40 to stay until 3 oclock which we took them up on due to a late flight. we considered New York New York before booking this. We actually liked walking around New York New York and the restaurants do may consider that down the road. All in I'd choose this hotel again for the location and moderate size and fair price.
30,We have stayed at numerous hotels in Vegas and decided to try out Mirage. Of course location is great (central). It was in Jan. so no pool review. Our room was on 21st floor and we splurged on a strip view. Not really worth it. More of a side view overlooked Caesar's mostly and then saw lights of strip. Bed was comfy room was clean. It is dated. The cable on the TV kept cutting out -every 5-10 minutes. VERY annoying. The mini fridge is practically a computer. We were told by front desk not to take anything out or we would be charged for it. I guess everything is in place with sensors. NO room to even put in a pop or water. In the end we had to have a charge taken off -$15.00- and I never touched any bottle or can. I missed having fridge space and also missed a coffee maker. The resort fee for 4 nights came to $167.00 piracy no matter how they try to justify it to guests. The central bar was nice The Stack was a good place for a drink just know we're talking a $9.00 beer and $14.00 cocktail. No good deals like years ago (not even pretzels or peanuts).Buffet was good and we got a veteran discount which was nice.
50,Our room was confortable quiet and clean. We loved The Beatles Love! It was fantastic. The food at The Pantry was very good. We enjoyed breakfast. Cocktails were good. Loved the Beatles store! Nice selection!
10,I was given the wrong room upon check-in due to overbooking. So I got a queen room and booked a king room. The next day I was given a king room and come to find out after talking to people in the elevator they got a king room when they booked a queen room. There communication between mirage staff is obviously not there. The windows in some of the room are sealed shut and the smoke seemed to be worst in the casino I couldn’t stand it. I’ve been staying here the last 13 years and I’ve decided it’s time to move on to a different hotel.
50,This was a nice surprise we got to see the baby dolphin. The tiger exhibit was very well laid out and the animals are clearly well loved and cared for. The cafe and gift shop are also well stocked and the prices aren’t bad. I would recommend it for those with families of all ages.
50,For price/value and for central location (especially for us who often travels with folk who stay at the Venetian and harrah's) the Mirage is hard to beat. great restaurants (Pantry for brekkie and Tom Colicchio's for steak especially) and an incredible pool given that it is one of the few with shade during summer. we swam this trip - chilly outside but pool was fine (although just the smaller pool). overall consider the Mirage a good option not going to break the bank but offers excellent services and very comfortable beds.
40,Nice hotel!! Staff are very accommodating. Bathroom could use some updating but overall a nice stay. Great location! Food at the Pantry is excellent! Buffet was good too. It is nice to have buffet include beer and wine :)
30,The hotel is nice warm and welcoming. However the main issue for me is the lack of cleaning that is done on a daily basis. The room isn’t vacuumed and therefore this causes the carpet to be very dirty. The bathroom also needs some attention as does the majority of the room it’s looking tired and unkempt which is a shame. Apart from these issues all in all a good hotel to stay at location is great!
10,The room is in need of repair and a deep cleaning. The carpet is dirty it appears that housekeeping doesn't vacuum every time. The bathroom needs repairs there was a gap between the ceiling and the tile and there was no lock on the bathroom door. The drywall is peeling of from water damage in the bathroom as well. We are also irritated at the fact that they charge a resort fee and charge you for parking every day whether you move your car or not.
40,I stayed at the Mirage after having stayed at two other places in Vegas.    Location: The Mirage is located quite centrally on the strip. It is almost in the middle of the strip which makes most casinos walkable.    Rooms: The rooms seem to have been renovated.  The bathrooms are a bit small though and 2 persons can not fit simultaneously. To be honest it wasn’t the best hotel room I’ve had in Vegas.  Checkout was also easy this could be done via a link sent to you by mail. No need to go to the front desk!    Parking: the Mirage is part of the MGM group. This means that if you pay for a day to park at the Mirage you can park in other MGM casinos free of charge by just inserting your room key at the entrance of the parking garage. This way I managed to park for free in the MGM Grand Bellagios New York- New York and Excalibur.  Considering the fact that most casinos have paid parking garages nowadays this will save you money if you don’t want to walk long distances!    I did not have breakfast at the hotel but there are plenty of options nearby to get food. We ate at a nearby Panda Expres.    The number one selling point of this hotel is thus the location and the parking benefits!
30,Room was adequate but nothing fancy. Casino felt a bit dark and dated. Food choices were limited. Seems to attract families. Volcano is fun to watch. Location is good with walking distance to Bellagio Treasure Island Cesars and Pallazo.
40,"I stayed at the Mirage on my way to another destination. I've stayed there before. The young desk staff were very friendly and helpful. At one point my key didn't work on my door and they helped me immediately. The hotel is a little older and the digs are not quite as shiny and new as some of the other hotels but I liked it. It feels a little more comfortable and not quite as hectic as some of the newer hotels that seem overcrowded and chaotic. ( I also stayed a Bellagio). --but still plenty to do. A nice casino and really nice choices for meals. My room was comfortable and clean. It overlooked the erupting volcano on the front of the building but was still quiet enough for me to rest on my trip. Did not see ""Beatles-Love-Cirque du Soleil"" but have seen Mystere across the street at TI. Definitely recommend that and would recommend Mirage."
50,Great clean property with friendly staff. I love the smell of the Mirage too. The location is perfect right in the middle of the strip. Sports book is nice and big. Great restaurants must go to Stack!
50,This is my third time coming back to the Mirage and I can't wait to plan my fourth trip. The hotel is located on a great spot on the Strip. The casino is my favorite to gamble in and they have a huge Sportsbook with a different variety of seating to watch all types of races or games! This trip we came during the winter time but in the summer they have the best pool!
30,Went to The Mirage for a New Year’s getaway. Knowingly paid premium room rates due to the holiday. Very disappointed in the lack of casual (i.e. low-cost) tables. Bar drinks super high. Long waits for breakfast which appeared to be slow due to staff not demand. All food really costly and kinda average.
50,Lovely hotel centrally located on the Las Vegas strip. Great heating and shower. Beds were comfortable. Only a small section of the pool was open which was fine for the children as it was heated. We had a nice view from our room too. Only down fall staying at this resort: we couldn’t use the refrigerator to store our bottles of water/milk and extra food. Be aware if you move any items at all from the refrigerator you will be charged for the items moved. You can request a seperate refrigerator at the cost of $35. Also very tight on supplying the minimal items for the bathroom but there was no problem when requesting more. Staff were very lovely. Would highly recommend this hotel for families.
50,Once again both my hubby and I were in Vegas with friends. We chose the Mirage both for their elegant hotel as well as their location to other nice hotels we like to gamble at. The rooms are always clean spacious and the shows inside the hotel are amazing. They include the Beatles cirque de Soleil Terry Fator and Boys 2 Men all shows I have seen and highly recommend. Since it was December we did not use the resort (pools outside ambience) yet we were charged 37.00 per day for resort fee which I'm still agreeable paying; however during the evening I took out a large bottle of smart water which would cost about 2.59 cost me 18.00 (there were no prices on mini bar and I imagined it would be overpriced but 18.00 is dispiible) so I'm warning everyone to buy your water at CVS or local store. Other than this the hotel/casino has a great staff a Starbucks great stores boutiques and truly is a great place to stay. You're across from dennys or an outback if you're trying to watch a budget or have children with you and your a cab ride or bus ride from old vegas/Fremont st. I would definitely go back to this hotel.
40,This was our second stay in this hotel room was fine comfortable beds plenty of choice for restaurants and bars would not hesitate to stay again. Well situated on the strip we were there for New Year and only had to step outside for fantastic views of the firework display. Would love a coffee machine in the room but as there was a Starbucks within the hotel this was not going to happen.
40,Decided to book a lastMinute trip To Vegas for the New Year. The Mirage was reasonable and theLocation was perfect. Had a nice time and would stay here again. The Rooms were clean and the bed was comfortable. And we had a great view for the new year fireworks show.
10,Staff was rude and not able to provide proper keys. No refrigerators or coffee makers in the rooms.The casino had such a poor ventilation system that we could not breath due to too much smoke. As the result both my wife and I ended up with soar throats.Hotel is really showing its age.Finding the hotel's parking was also a hassle.
40,I love the location and room layout. It is not too expensive.The only problem I have is the parking fee since it is $24 and higher than I expected.However the friendly staff (except the security at 9:00pm ) helps to solve all necessary issues.
20,Was there new years eve for my twin daughters 21st birthday. The room was very damp and musty. Around the window was all wet. Seemed pretty warm in the room and like air did not work. Great location just disappointed in quality of room
40,Looking forward to going back. The staff is Great and enjoyed my trip immensely. Clean Friendly many tables and machines to choose from when gambling. Close to all attractions on the strip or great shows in house.
40,The rooms here are spacious and mostly well equipped. The bathroom was a bit dated and there was no kettle. Check in was pretty quick and efficient. The hotel was incredibly busy but the lifts coped well and it never felt too hectic. Love the location of this hotel and restaurant choices are reasonable.
50,"The hotel is VERY nice clean and beautiful! I loved how it had it's own attraction with the Volcano eruption at night great little show! The casino itself is on the smaller side but it was great. The restaurants in the Mirage were all very nice and the food was fantastic. The check-in process was horrible. We got in on a Thursday night around midnight and the line was crazy. They only had THREE staff checking in people. We were on line for over an hour! We finally got helped and they didn't have a room available for us so they put us in a suite for one night. Obviously that was an amazing room but we had to wait around the following day for a text that never came in order to be put into a new room. This held us at the casino for half of the day. We finally called down to get the status of our new room and they had one available. We get to the new room and the bathroom was disgusting so we were moved AGAIN. Needless to say we complained and we were comped the resort fees as well as given money to spend on food. We had no issues for the remaining time and our new room was fine. I will not book a ""run of the house"" room when booking again. It's worth a little extra money to secure a room."
40,The rooms are quite large and it was nice and comfortable. We paid extra for the view of the strip though I don’t think it was worth it. There are very bright spotlights on the structure in front so all you can see are the spotlights reflected in the glass and it’s hard to see the volcano erupting due to this. As with all Las Vegas casinos it’s quite a walk to get to your room. This hotel is in a great location with the mall close by pharmacy and convenience stores are also close by. There were a few annoying things like you can’t use the fridge (though they are very clear on the policy that you can’t take anything out of the fridge and you can’t put your own things in) and tea and coffee facilities would be handy.
50,The Mirage is our favorite Casino and Hotel on the strip. The location is excellent and easy to access. The casino is welcoming and friendly. The staff is great and the casino is clean. There are a variety of restaurants and the buffet is affordable. The rooms are nice but our pillows were a bit flat.
40,I love the Mirage the rooms are nice and big super comfortable and clean I’ve stayed here one previous time and loved it! They use to have a delicious Brazilian restaurant but got rid of it so sad. So we tried the buffet on our second stay and let me save you some time and money this is a buffet you can definetly skip. Everyone loves a good Vegas buffet but unfortunately the one at the Mirage is not one the choices are extremely limited and not that great tasting. The dessert station is super sad smallest dessert station I’ve ever seen at a buffet place your better off eating at Hometown Buffet than the Cravings buffet at the Mirage. My husband left the buffet hungry that says a lot no one should ever leave a buffet still hungry.
50,We loved the family like atmosphere here. Everyone was so friendly. We are at heritage steaks and it was great. Pantry was great for breakfast. The steak street tacos at the still are amazing! Will definitely come back!!
30,First the Mirage belongs to the MGM Resorts Group. No matter what your rate is at any of the Resorts add about $40.00 for a resort fee it does not matter if you use their services or not. Also there is a fee to park. At the Mirage I suggest using the $24 a day charge and use the valet parking as there is no place to park to check in. I also suggest you check in early thru their app. if it works you could save up to an hour in a check in line. I learned this this the hard way. Be ready for $5.00 coffee $9.00 beer etc. The reason I gave them an average score was their employees are wonderful in all departments otherwise it would have been a lower score.  The Mirage does great with the big things like shows landscaping casino etc. It is the little things that I was critical of. We were suppose to get a text when room was ready did not get a text until 2 hours after I was in room heater did not work after two tries in two days got it going cheap items like the toilet beginning of mold in shower USB plug pulling out of mount slow draining sinks hard water. When a place charges first class prices I expect a little more. Overall I had a good time and might even go back depending on what other resorts have to offer.
50,Our tower king room was great as usual. I love the bed and we had a nice view as well. The casino was busy but not overcrowded over the holiday. My husband had to work remotely but I was entertained by all the new slots and many old favorites.
50,The Mirage hotel is a very nice hotel located directly on the strip everything is walking distance. My fiancé and I enjoyed our experience at the Mirage. We visit the bar nightly which served decent drinks. I would definitely stay at the Mirage again.
10,We stood in line for 35 minutes while 3 of the 5 desk clerks walked off into the back and never returned. Then what appeared to be directors also walked away into the back room and never returned. Everyone in line was shocked at the lack of customer care that was shown by the staff. Hostess at the Pantry was rude and dismissive.
50,My family and I greatly enjoyed the stay. Over the years this was our third or fourth visit to Mirage. Always loved it. Great location amazing food and very clean. They do need to renovate the bathrooms.
10,"I can't say enough bad things about this hotel. We chose it because the website claims that the pools are ""open and heated all year long."" That is apparently a lie. The pool was closed. Another issue is the price. The price is high for no reason what so ever. You get much better value at a simpler and cheaper hotel. Then there is the issue of the minibar. There was no price list for the items in the minibar and I thought that they couldn't be TOO expensive. Boy was I wrong. I was charged $10 for each item! In other words $10 for a can of diet coke! Unlike other hotels wifi at the Mirage is not free and neither is parking. The rooms are worse than at a roadside motel since they contain neither a refrigerator nor a microwave. Not even a microwave! In other words this hotel should be at the bottom when it comes to prices but it costs anywhere between $2-300 a night. Please do yourselves a favor and go elsewhere."
40,We came down and spent New Year's in Vegas. The Mirage was reasonably priced for such a major event. Staff was friendly and the Hotel made every attempt to make sure people were safe to the best of their abilities for such a big event. They had extra security staff onsite along with making sure no glass bottles or glasses left the property. We had a great time and look forward to our next visit to Vegas.
50,This was my first time to Las Vegas. We stayed at the Mirage. The staff was helpful the rooms were clean the bed was comfortable. The casino was great. This hotel is within. Walking distance of Treasure Island Caesars Palace The Bellagio and many others.
30,While this hotel was nothing special I was still glad to stay there. I love the location of the Mirage. Check-in and out seems chaotic but moves quickly. The room was of a decent size the bed and linens were comfortable. However the quality of the amenities were lacking. There was a huge gash in the headboard of the bed; the faucets for both sink and shower were poor and the water ran really hot. The thing I liked least about the stay were the smelly toiletries.    The cleaning staff was really great. They were a presence but kept pretty quiet and made up our room very quickly.
40,Overall its a great place to stay right in the middle of the strip. We had no issue finding parking and locating our room which is sometimes a hassle in a big casino. The only downside about my stay was the restroom they made a wider entrance for the room but took a lot of space from the restoom which you cant do anything when the restroom door is open as in shower or use the toliet but other then that i would recommend this hotel the view from our room was great!!
40,"I when in Las Vegas we always choose the Mirage as we can count on it being a good value clean & attractive environment great dining choices & fun games.the staff was very friendly and upgraded us to their ""wellness floor"" which had aromatherapy machines & a more relaxed and comfortable accommodations including a memory foam mattress."
30,Mirage has a great location on the strip. the room was ok with good bed but nothing special for the price. Table minimums for craps and table games a bit on the high side. Gym and spa was nice. Uber pick up drop off out on the north entrance
40,I really enjoy staying at The Mirage because of its prime location on the Strip. It's right across the street from the Venetian shops and next door to the shops at Caesars Palace. The restaurants are great too; Otoro has absolutely phenomenal service and quality of food. Fantastic! I stayed in the Resort King which was a nice and beautiful room with a very comfy bed and modern design.
10,Rooms are outdated! You walk in and the smell is strong. Ripped leather head boards Hair in the tub glasses are dirty towels smelled. If you can stay away from here. Staff downstairs is very friendly but its not worth your money.
50,Mirage is always our go to place. Friendly staff beds are comfortable  food is delicious and most of all gambling is excellent pay out. First time for New Year’s Eve and it’s definitely a partying good time.
30,The hotel has a good location. Too much confusion of room availability at the time of checkin. Frustrating that room is not available even when we had reserved it in advance. The drink service at Casino slot area is not good.
40,Loved the location of this hotel. For us it’s the ideal spot on the strip. The hotel offers the usual Vegas variety of in-house eateries and a casino.    We were given a free upgrade to a State Room/Spa Room on the 12th floor. The room has mood lighting a view of the Volcano aromatherapy infused air com ortho mattress on a super king sized bed some sort of infusion in the shower water sun rise alarm clock desk and comfy snuggle chair.    The mini bar prices were expensive. Remember if you pick up an item you pay for it so don’t pick something up to look at! Water is $18 a bottle - extortionate! Pop to Walgreens across the road and it’s $2 or free if you drink from the water fountains.    The first room we were allocated hadn’t been cleaned as we discovered when we opened the door. After ringing the front desk we were allocated another room and told we could use the same key. We couldn’t so I had to traipse (it’s a long way through the casino to the lobby) to reception to have the key recoded. We were credited one nights resort fee for the inconvenience.    All the staff we met were lovely. The room was cleaned every day and was always spotless. Not sure about all the spa stuff in the room whether it worked or not and how much the extra charge is but we liked it. It was something different and added to our experience.    Worth signing up for an Mlife Card the loyalty not the credit card you can use it every time you buy something use a slot machine gamble in any MGM Resort hotel of which The Mirage is one and collect points. The more points you collect the more options you have e.g. free upgrades.
40,The stay at the mirage started out with a really long wait to check in. 3 people working at the counter to check in a very long line. This was at midnight. They were short rooms and put us in a beautiful suit for the night. They said they would contact us at 7am to switch. We waited until about 12 then complained because we wanted to go out and explore. They comped a bunch of fees and moved our room. Our next room had not been cleaned so they moved us again and gave us 150 to spend on food and beverage. Overall the rooms were beautiful and had very comfortable beds. I would recommend to stay and if there is an issue definitely complain. They are generous with comps.
40,The slots were tighter. The mattress on the bed is awesome! Location is great-we ride the monorail and it’s an easy walk across the street to Harrah’s to get the monorail. If you check in later be ready for a room you didn’t necessarily reserve. We had a handicap accessible room and the shower water goes all over the floor so be sure to order extra towels to help that. Would stay again.
10,We waited for an hour at midnight to check in. We are a family of 6 and need 2 rooms so we were charged an unexpected 80 dollars for each room plus they put a 400 dollar hold for damages! When we were shocked the clerk told us it was because of third party bookings I let her know we booked direct and she just shrugged. As we cancelled our second night. We went to our room and our headboard had a huge tear mold was growing from under the sink and it smelled like stale cigarettes. The pool was closed except for a small area and the attendants were too busy eating breakfast by the Cabanas to tell us where to find the hot tub another guest showed us. We went to another hotel to gamble. The mirage was “Sad” and “Smelled” per my children. When we asked for a quick bite to eat the bell hops told us nothing was nearby...really? The area outside of the Mirage was something else... my kids met their first meth addict and my son (who is 14) was whipped in the butt by a woman dressed as a police officers with her butt and breasts out...it was 9 am!Later we did find the Linq promanade. That is where I would go if you are going with your family. Stay clear of the Mirage!!!
50,There are so many choices in Las Vegas but the Mirage is hard to beat because of their great location modern amenities the overall casino games lots of restaurants to choose from and a great pool. I may gamble $200 a day so the M life offers are very generous.
50,Had a wonderful experience. Check in was kind of slow but to be expected at a busy hotel. We decided to stay a second night and I wish i could remember the ladies name at the front desk because she was amazingly helpful!!
50,Quick vacation choice and a very good one. Will definitely go here again. The Mirage made this Vegas trip truly enjoyable. Ventilation is all to often a problem in the rooms when cigarette smoke is not agreeable but the Mirage does a great job with smoke mitigation.
50,Amazing hotel! We loved staying at this hotel and plan on staying here again. There is so much to do just at this hotel the staff our friendly and the food at some of the restaurants that we went to were really good and not very pricey.
10,This Casino has the most children and baby strollers in Vegas to make matters worse the room had large water leak in ceiling of bath despite multiple notifications it was never fixed... then we received absolutely no assistance when changing rooms and new room had mold issues...
20,We checked in a little late and had called them to inform our late arrival. They said there is not problem we can come and check in anytime before 4AM. We had 2 rooms they gave us the handicap room which had no chairs and was very different from the normal room. Since it was late and we were tired we went to sleep and continued our stay in the same room. There are a number of hotels on the strip much cheaper than this. I am sure the rooms cannot be any worse than this.
50,The Miage has an excellent location on the strip with easy walking in any direction. We were very pleased with everything during our recent stay. All of the staff we interacted with was very friendly and helpful. We also felt very comfortable at all hours with the number of security personnel walking around. Rooms were very nice excellent food choices and amazing entertainment with the Beatles Love show! Enjoyed our time in the casino as well. We are already planning our next trip and we will be staying at the Mirage.
50,Our favorite place too stay . It’s very close to Eve and we love the pool in the summer .Food is good and we love the sushi restaurant.The rooms are clean and good service . Just hate the paid parking .
20,Mirage is still a good hotel but the age definitely is showing. We had leaking room during our first night of stay and we had to drag our luggage around 1 in the morning to change rokm twice. Because they can’t do it right the first time.
50,"Excellent value for the money spent. Top location on the strip as well. Overall excellent experience. Would definitely stay hear again. We booked the ""Stay Well"" room which included some nice upgrades."
10,28 year anniverary date night almost completely ruined. Online check in desk attendant was unhelpful and unfriendly. Room was gross dirty tile old peeling wood on most surfaces. Headboard once pillows were moved had huge hole in vinyl tv didnt work. Took 17 minutes for hotel to answer phone for repair or change rooms and we werent even offered a new room 1.5 hours later a tv repair guy reset the system and kinda fixed tv. Our show tickets to Jay Leno were purchased over phone the attendant insisted they were great seats! Get to venue and were were in absolute back in some booth with 6 people that were very very large in front of us..... the seating was level so we couldnt see. We got up to leave and the very nice usher stopped is and changed our seats! He saved the trip!!! Only redeeming quality of our anniversary!
50,Just so I could say that I had been to Las Vegas I booked a King Suite at The Mirage Hotel and Casino.  Took me ages to work out how to get to Valet Parking as I came into Las Vegas Blvd the wrong way. Did a U turn at the lights and realized that I had turned too early as the entrance was already behind me. After another couple of attempts got there in the end.  Wasn't that impressed when I got to Reception with the time it took to check in even though there is a large reception area.  Ended up with a suite on the 25th floor which was excellent. Went to inspect the Hotel and Casino Area. Impressive.  Went to Denny's across the road so I could watch the Mirage Volcano.  After Dinner I watched the roulette table and other gambling areas. I don't gamble at Casinos and it was frightening to watch the amount of money being dropped by some people at the Roulette Table. Sad actually. In 30 minutes that I watched  one guy gambled a $100 chip each time and lost the lot.  Went to the Terry Fator Theatre as I had booked to see Bill Maher at 10:00PM. Great show.  Las Vegas to me is a place of sad dreams.  Glad I came and stayed but won't be back.  The Mirage Hotel is however recommended for those that do like Vegas.
30,This was my first stay at the Mirage. The check-in and overall interaction with staffs were nice and friendly. The room was ready earlier than 3 pm which was also nice. The room was nice and fairly clean except fir the bathroom. It was hair all over from the sink to the floor to the bathtub. I had to call the housekeeping to have someone come over to clean the bathroom again. When I first called in about the bathroom condition they asked if I just checked in. Told them yes and then they said they would send someone to clean. After I called in a supervisor arrived in about 30 minutes and she inspected thr bathroom and sent someone to clean again. She did an ok job.
50,Loved the MLife program for Veterans Free parking throughout my stay and hefty 40% discount at the buffet at Mirage which it self is outstanding dining even without the discount. Close in to all other casinos like Paris Venetian Caesars Palace.
50,We stayed here for a week first time and will not be the last.. Top notch resort!! Super clean all of the staff was absolutely wonderful from check in restaurants Bell hops casino floor. The pool area is amazing only negative is the opening time. I am an early riser and it would have been relaxing to go sit by the pool at 7am with coffee and soak in the peace and quiet. Elevators were quick excellent location. Love the Mirage
20,Room on the 12th floor was renovated and was nice. Other than that you can’t use the fridge in the room because it’s sensored and you’ll get charged if anything is moved no coffee maker no kettle no microwave snacks and water in room are sensored so be careful not to move anything. The elevators to the rooms are really far away from the entrance and the rooms at the end of the hall are super far from the elevators you can’t use the stairs and the guy checking us in took almost an hour finding us rooms. They only care about nickel and diming their guests everywhere. Don’t stay here! Lots of better options!
50,We celebrated our birthdays in the 2 bedroom Penthouse. If you're celebrating...do it in style. The Penthouse is large & comfy. TV's in each room and the living room. Lovely coffee counter bar. Only thin missing was a coffee pot. Feels like you're being spoiled. The high floors are quiet and the service is good.
50,We were very pleased with the Mirage especially compared to the other 4-5 star hotels on the strip (they are too crowded). Easy to navigate and friendly staff. I was surprised how much I liked the Sleep Well rooms! Getting coffee in the morning is a chore and room service is not up to par- however I really enjoyed the more relaxing and beautiful environment after all the other casinos. Good family choice for hotel as I had previously read in other reviews.
40,Recent stay for the first time was a very positive experience starting with easy mobile check in and excellent staff who found another room for early arrival. Room was clean comfortable and i enjoyed the upgraded strip view on 17th floor. Easier to navigate the property than other larger mega-hotels but great location for easy walking to other hotels shopping and eating.
50,One of the best hotels I have been to for the last few years. Really what you would expect of Las Vegas. Good food Casino on the ground floor and a really nice pool area. Only downside is that it is right at the end of the strip.
40,Hotel was clean and comfortable and staff was friendly and helpful.Location was great because you are about in the middle of everything .Lots of gaming and entertainment choices.Very prompt service for checking in and concierge service
10,"Horrible check in experience. Even though I had pre checked in online my room was not ready. I asked the priority check in desk when it might be ready. They said ""This line is for Gold card members only. I can't even talk to you."" They said I could wait for an email or stand in the regular line (now over 200 people). I waited an hour and the email came. I went to the mobile check in and ALL the machines were down. There were NO attendants on duty. A number of customers tried over and over to get them to work. Finally I went back to the priority desk and they sent someone over to manually prepare room keys for everyone. I had arrived at 4:45 and got my room key at 6:45. Horrible Service!  P.S. I have a suggestion for you. Have a person on the floor not behind the counter to answer questions and ensure that operations are running smoothly. Is that too much to ask?"
50,We stayed in a Comfortable and quiet room. Very clean. Happy looking staff. Good stay. Convenient location. Free parking at other properties owned by same company. Parking garage easy to navigate. First time staying here.
40,My family (wife 14 and 19 yr old daughters ) enjoyed our post xmasMirage stay. Our suite was beautiful though lacking in some surprising things (eg shower caps mouth wash).The strip location is perfect: easy walk to Bellagio PH Miracle mile TI etc.I would give 5 stars for the Pantry 4 for California Pizza Kitchenand 2 for the buffet (service relatively poor/food mediocre).The Terry Fator show: excellent for most any age
30,The room was dirty and had maintenance issues. When we reported them they were brushed over. We asked for a blanket after tracking someone down in the hall as no one answered the phone or was downstairs and they said they were on their way and someone showed up an hour later. Hotel was ok but the attention to details was missing
20,We stayed at the hotel with the guarantee of 2 connecting rooms for our family vacation. Upon check-in they could not honor that commitment. Also the hotel's air handlers are old and casino smells smokey.
40,Overall it was good. Had an issue when someone showed up to change a filter unannounced walked in to the bathroom and one of our party was completely naked and quite embarrassed. Reported it to the desk clerk upon check out but didn’t really receive an acknowledgment
50,Good stay the suite was well appointed. Gaming was disappointing not that I lost that usually happens... I just didn’t feel good about it this time. Not enough action and excitement on slot play. Still I had fun
50,Wanted to do a special trip for my birthday and going to Vegas top of the list this year my friend stayed at the mirage hotel earlier n recommended this hotel and I was well pleased I would also recommended also. I like being on the 17th floor you can see the layout of Vegas nicely
50,its was very very nice staying here i really liked everything in this hotel.casino was clean rooms where awsom specially the customer service was wondeful and main thing restaounts where very very good again and again thank you
10,Room has no functional shower and the service never attended after multiple attempts. They had charged us double the amount for a single refreshment that we have used. There toll free number never works to discuss the bill....totally had worst experience.
30,We took a family trip to Vegas for Xmas this year and based on some reviews I picked this place for being more kid friendly.  Pros:  1. Great central location  2. Good eating options reviewed separately  3. Spacious rooms  4. A dolphin exihibit in the hotel  5. Friendly staff for the most part  Cons:  1. Older rooms but clean  2. House keeping didn’t come until 4-5 pm  And not very thorough  3. No indoor pool  4. Resort fee !! I found this completely ridiculous  Overall I would say a decent place to stay but as for being kid friendly I don’t think that’s the case at all.  I would recommend one of the places that don’t have a Casino .
50,This was my 4th trip to Vegas and we just loved the Mirage! Not too big not too small. Great dining options beautiful pool helpful staff very clean and roomy guest room. And the location on the strip is absolutely perfect!!! You can walk to almost anywhere very easily. I will definitely be staying at the Mirage again!
50,I can only comment on the Stay Well rooms & they are very nice & refreshing. Went to see Terry Fator & he put on a great Christmas show. One night staycation for us. Just enough to get away. This 200 minimum survey is stupid!
50,I love The Mirage! My mom and I have made the tradition to come to Vegas every Christmas It is our fourth time at this hotel and we absolutely love it. The rooms are very comfortable and spacious. I personally think it’s located in the best part of The Strip close to the Fashion mall and the other cool Casinos in the area. The hotel staff has always made us feel very welcoming and they have a pretty fast service . I love the casino even though I haven’t win a lot. If you love Starbucks there’s one just before exiting the hotel. I think staying her is a brilliant choice don’t be fooled by reviews that say the hotel looks old not true. We will keep coming to this hotel we love it in every way. We are checking out tomorrow! Don’t want to leave we will be back Mirage!
50,Great Customer Service self parking close enough in the center of the strip accesible to many outside restaurants and very clean amazing desk service and felt safe lots of security staff. Valet was always moving
40,First time at The Mirage. Overall great stay. Staffs were nice. The room could you use a little updating but other than that it was nice and comfortable. Due to the Christmas holiday check in/check out line was a bit much especially if you need to ask a question rather than do auto check out.
10,When arrived there was someone in my room. Front desk sent me to another room on another floor. The key didn’t work and I had to return to the front desk to jet the key reprogrammed. Took over an hour after calling to get my luggage. Was told resort fund would be refunded and $25 food/drink credit given. Didn’t happen. When checking out by phone was told receipt would be email. Haven’t received it. Horrable customer service
30,Had just a so so trip on this visit to LV. Staff were friendly but the hotel is showing it's age. Valet was slow. Buffet was just OK. I would suggest just going to Denny's across the street and saving your money rather than the buffet. Breakfast buffet was $80 total on Christmas eve for 2 people. Took 3 calls to get a bulb replaced and they still didn't show. (1st call waited an hour. 2nd call waited an hour and half and had to leave.(do not disturb was on after that) and then the third time we called at 9:30pm when we got back the last night and was up until about 1:30am and they never showed no call no knock nothing. A little frustrated by that. As I said before some wait times just to drop off your car with Valet. (5-10 mins) You had to wait as they cleared a whole lane and then the cars would move forward etc. Not what you expect for $20+ a day service. Thankfully it was free. But still might help if they hired more or had more on staff as this seemed to be a daily thing. (5 night stay) The hotel shows its age and could use an update so if you're looking for something fancy stay at the Bellagio or Pallazo. I'll go back but won't seek this spot out on purpose which is a shame because in years past we've had good stays there.
30,Nice spacious room and decent interior refurbishing but old bed(?) with soft springs at center was so awful to sleep on. Body ache following morning. Bath tub doesn't look clean. Slip resistant coating in the tub makes it look dirty. Silicone sealant around tub was yellowed and dirty. The poor patch work of new calking at tile walls reminds me an old apartment.Shower head looks old and stuck so the water is inconsistent. One of the worst shower experience in my life. No complimentary bottles of water and coffee maker in the room.
20,"Overview: The Mirage is old and tired and in desperate need of a) room updates and b) attitude adjustments.    Checking in - Check-in is at 3pm. I got to the desk at 3:40pm went through the check-in process (which for whatever reason is painfully slow) am handed room keys then told ""Come back in 45 minutes and we'll tell you the room number since they're still cleaning it."" So here I am with all my luggage and stranded for 45 minutes. Real classy. Check-in seems to be an extremely slow and inefficient process (every single one I watched while I was standing there had to go to the back room while checking in a guest for what?!?!) and while they're trying to be nice you can tell it's a ""forced"" nice with an unfortunate ""I just work here"" attitude.    The Room    Room doors no longer auto close/latch. They get real close to it then just hang. Two rooms I was in did this and saw a few others in the halls that appear to have been the same. Time for new self-closing hinges. Speaking of doors these doors block ZERO sound. Every single thing going on in nearby rooms or in the hallway is clearly (and loudly) audible through the door. There were kids screaming and playing well into the wee hours of the morning and it sounded like it was right outside the door. Super annoying and sleep preventing.    Bathrooms are VERY dated! Mildew in the shower caulk and you can tell they've just caulked over it each time. The bathroom etched glass/mirror probably used to be fancy but has some nasty buildup behind it which looks disgusting (the bathroom light is part of the glass/mirror so it really shows up). The towels are well worn - don't expect any fluffy or soft comforts.    The bed was okay definitely aged. The linens were okay nothing special. The carpet is gross and needs to be restretched; there are bumps in the carpet everywhere where it has been stretched out - literally almost tripped on a big one at the end of the bed several times.    The room could benefit from some additional updates! Looking for an outlet near the bed to charge your phone at night? Be ready to pull out a dresser and unplug a lamp; outlets are few and far between. And when you DO find an outlet cross your fingers that your charger will stay plugged in; my outlet was so loose the charger would fall right out and I had to push the dresser against it to block it in place. There's a outlet/USB at the desk but it's nowhere near the bed where most people like to charge up. The decor - meh... Not awful but dated for sure.    The mini-bar in the room is ridiculous an absolute cash grab (shocker). Prices are NOT visibly listed and while you my think it's convenient and couldn't possibly cost more than a few bucks for that bottle of water think twice... It's an $18 bottle of water. Fire up your TV and make your way through a couple of menus and you'll eventually see the absolutely insane prices they're charging for the snacks ($10 for a single 12oz can of soda anyone?)    General -  General maintenance in the hotel areas is lacking... Multiple times there were bags of trash in the halls near the elevator like someone came and emptied some cans but left the bag near the elevators for someone else to pick up. Also really annoying: one of the elevator buttons (16th floor) did not work... So you push it wait awhile for a lift and realize it isn't coming... So you try the one on the other wall and BING! Here comes the lift.    ""Security"" at nights check room keys before you get to the elevators... Not sure what the purpose of this is (since you can just walk through with some random stranger and say you're with them) but it's really annoying. Came back with my hands full one night their machismo demanded to see a key... Like I'm hauling an armload of crud up to just abandon in the hallway somewhere?? I suppose there's a point to it but I found it annoying... Not the end of the world.    The casino is a casino 'nuf said. The hotel quality and the greed (i.e. ridiculous ""resort fee"" for nothing beneficial)... Yeah no thanks. It is very unlikely that I would stay at The Mirage again in the future."
50,The concierge services were great the house keeping is awesome too. The food and beverages are ok. The room AC made some noises and it sometimes bothered us sleep. The hotel location is great as well.
40,We enjoyed our stay staff were very helpful room upgrade to a stay well room was good although it’s hard to know if it was better than the resort tower room we had booked.A bit disappointed the bathroom in the stay well room didn’t have a nicer shower or double vanity.
40,This is a great hotel with many activities. I only got to see the volcano erupt once but would definitely return. The food is really good. I ate at Carnegies Deli last time I was here and the portions are HUGE. The slot machines have a good variety. Also don't miss Beatles Love show. It's FANTASTIC!!
10,We arrived to check in and we verified where the oversized parking was located. The valet attendant told us how to get there and to call for a shuttle to give us a ride back to the hotel. Once we Arrived at the oversized vehicle parking the security guard at the lot checked us in then directed us to the pay station and the courtesy phone to call for a shuttle to the hotel. We paid for lot ($15.00 for 24 hrs) and then picked up the provided phone to call for the shuttle. I was put on hold when the gal returned We were informed that there was no shuttle available. NO SHUTTLE SERVICE was available! I asked them how we were supposed to get all the way to the hotel said she didn’t know I asked for a Manager and waited on hold AGAIN she apologized and said she couldn’t find her manager. We had to walk carry our luggage and get our dog into the hotel check in What a nightmare! The rooms are accessed alll the way thru the casino so we had to walk our dog all the wAy through all that noise! She was freaking out we also asked for early check in we had to wait until 2 pm.  For the price we paid for one night ($250) it was NOT a good fit. Check out was 1100 so were were onthe room for 21 hours! Outrageous! We will not be back!  Not Pet friendly too far for pets to acc SS outside.  Not handicapped accessible from oversized vehicle lot.  Not a good price!  Avoid the Mirage!
50,Everyone at this property were awesome. Our check in was fast and easy Mlife desk was AWESOME Cravings Buffet was great and a lot to choose from. The slots were fun and we never had a problem getting on the tables or slots. Great property. Thank you Mlife we had a great time!!
50,What an amazing place from the entrance to the staff o the amazing rooms I would recommend the Mirage time and Time again! You are in a great location and close to Cesar’s Forum shops and then you can be across the street at the Linq promenade in no time!
50,We took the trip just as a getaway for the weekend. Our room was a corner view see could a lot of the strip and it overlooked the Volcano as well. The service was great and it was relaxing. I usually don't stay in the main strip area as my normal reason for visiting Las Vegas is racing and it is on the north end of town. The Mirage is right in the middle of everything and is easily accessible to everything. If you stay at an MGM resort and valet park you can valet park at any MGM resort at no charge and parking is around $24 everywhere.
10,Broken thin blanket not warm at all. No free coffee tea coffee machine or kettle as other hotel has as standard amenities. Ask for hot water reception said need to pay extra charge. Will never stay this hotel again!
50,Excellent overall casino with great personnel and facilities. Definately would stay here again . Casino has perfect and convinient location overall . Access to everything is at hands reach  recomneded 100%
40,Used comp room for my stay last weekend and upgraded to resort king tower. The room is very nice and clean. I like the decor very modern. 2 things lacking is outlet on the bedside table for my CPAP breathing medical device charging outlet for my phone and iPad. The bathroom is very nice with 2 sinks. Would have been better if there is a magnifying round mirror on the wall. Lots of restaurants inside the hotel so it’s very convenient. Tammy from Dolphin Habitat is very informative. The hotel staff are very nice and goes above and beyond. We got locked out of our room one night but one guy from housekeeping and Kathy from Security were awesome. Great customer service. I played slots and black jack table. Both were fun but don’t count on winning. If you do have seasonal allergies bring your meds. Overall good place to stay and hang.
40,Please bring back your coffee maker to the hotel room.Why do we have to pay for parking if we stay at your hotel?And why don't you get rid of liquid body wash?The hotel gave me the room on 6th floor all the way to the end of hallway; although we ask for a room in higher level.
50,I’ve stayed at 5 different hotels in Vegas and this was the best one so far.    The Mirage is an oasis in the middle of the strip . It’s conveniently located and everything was perfect !    The rooms are stylishly elegant and offer relaxing comfort and are very noise proof .    The vibe is classy and vibrant throughout . Oh and that pool !! Out back is Hawaiian island paradise where you can enjoy a siesta in the sun or take a dip in the beautiful pools.    You will also love the outdoor drink hut nestled in the palm trees - located out back away from the pool .    We sooo loved our girl’s getaway at the Mirage- everything a gal needs to feel pampered . A very fun stay !
40,The Mirage has a good location on the strip. The rooms are comfortable and if your trip includes a trip to see the Beatles Love this is the best place to stay. Also consider going to the Secret Garden. The dolphins were great.
10,No water in room. Tap water undrinkable. Bottled water (generic) $10. Coke $10. No coffee. No hot water no tea. No slipper. Forgot to clean room. $50 charge if they find your diabetes medicine in their minibar refrigerator. Room dated. Bathtub tiny. Since small. No amenities . No Nothing.
40,We love being center strip. Mirage is aging but still most convenient place. The coffee sop was closed so we ate breakfasts at the Venetian. The Pantry was nice but too pricey. The gal at registration when we arrived was delightful. Totally not busy the week before x-mad. Wish they’d get rid of the room fridge
40,My business associates and wife and I had a great time at the Mirage love the place and will attend again!Thanks you again for the great time and service by the Mirage staff amenities and MGM facilities along the strip.
10,I booked a suite 6 months in adavance kept checking to make sure the room was still available for me and it was two days before check in the morning of check in I called and was told I no longer had a reservation there and my room was given away. Spoke to manager Charlie Tran who was extremely rude and told me they were not obligated to accommodate me and proceeded to hang up the phone on me. He was very unprofessional and I felt truly insulted at how I was treated
30,I stayed at the Mirage and the room was nice. This is more a statement about casinos in general not only the one at the Mirage but too much smoking. Those of us who don’t smoke don’t want to walk through it or have to wash our clothes to get the smell out. Isn’t it possible to make at least a portion of the casino non-smoking? If I didn’t want to deal with the smoke I suppose I could not go to the casino. Well you have to walk through the casino to get to the elevators to the rooms. Perfect way to introduce me to the ambiance of the hotel. Other than the smoke the hotel was very nice and the food was great. Staff were friendly and accommodating. Overall an enjoyable experience and could be so much better if a non-smoking section could be available!
50,I've seen the volcano display in movies and really wanted to see it in person. It was everything I'd imagined. Wish I could have seen it closer but with so many people there to see it I'm just glad I got to as much as I did.
50,A 21 year olds dream came true. The Mirage showed very well for my young man fulfilling a request for his birthday made years ago. He enjoyed Vegas and the Grand Canyon while in the hands of his father and the staff at a famous great casino! Thank you Mirage!!
40,Nice 4 day early week getaway. Check in was smooth and efficient. Wife wanted a nap and noticed the sheets on the bed smelled a little and we were given a new room without any questions. Found all the persons working in the Casino to be very professional and a couple of the ladies that were over 80 years old were terrific. Not the top of the line in Vegas but very good for family trip. Had plenty of 10 tables to play but 6-5 on odds. Seems to be the norm in Vegas unless playing 25 per hand.
50,Great classic casino hotel but watch out for that minibar. Room was surprisingly huge and modern. The bedding was just white sheets that was strange. Nothing fancy there. Love the casino. The whole place feels classy without being pretentious like some other hotels in the area. Just perfect.
50,First stay in a few years and The Mirage continues to impress. It’s not as flashy or pretentious as some of the newer resorts but it captures the right balance of elegance and comfort. Very conveniently located at the north end of the modern strip.
30,Beautiful resort best I've been yet only problem for me is that dogs are allowed in this resort and unfortunately a couple rooms down from mine there was a small dog that would not stop barking and I couldn't sleep for hours til I went out and a security was coming and asked if I was bothered by it too so apparently there were more complaints and later the dog stopped but took a while to make it stop. Didnt get a nice rest like I wished
10,They nickel and dime you for every little thing. They put pressure sensors in the refrigerator so if you move anything at all you get charged. No personal fridge. Long walks to the room from lobby. No shuttles running to parking garage offsite.
50,The Mirage was built in 1989 but it has been kept up so nicely that if feels very new. The property is well maintained and smells great too. The restaurants are very up to date with many assorted offerings for food types. The staff is very friendly courteous and helpful. I felt very comfortable at the Mirage. The show (Beatles LOVE) is great - I saw it during my prior visit. Lastly the gambling related offering provided many types of games to play including lower than expected minimum required bet amounts. This allowed me to get involved without becoming over committed right away. I will be back. Thank you.
50,This hotel is really nice. The food in the restaurants is great. Its right next to everything and very walkable for the strip. We walked across the street to Dennys and The Venetian Caesars Palace Treasure Island and several other hotels are nearby enough to walk to.
10,Found a needle on the room floor bathroom very dirty. Windows were opened on the 8th on the floor and had no screen very unsafe for children. I don't think the room was cleaned and after finding a needle it was very uncomfortable to stay.
10,Talk about rude. She(Karissa sp?) definitely doesn't belong in the job she's at. Belongs somewhere hidden from the public. She's a liar and was called out on it. Nothing much she could do but pout then.
50,We had an amazing weekend at The Mirage! We got married over the weekend and David at the front desk was so kind as to upgrade us to a One Bedroom Penthouse Suite and it really made the weekend extra special for us. The service was incredible. We only had food from the Pantry for room service and breakfast but everything we ordered was really wonderful. Checking in was a piece of cake and even though there was a long check-out line they processed everyone quickly so it didn't take too long. I would definitely stay here again and will be sending my clients here as well. Thank you for a wonderful weekend!
50,We have been staying at the Mirage for over 10 years and go 2 to 6 times a year. We have never been disapointed with our stay at the Mirage and it keeps improving. My wife and I will probably always stay at the Mirage as long as our host does.
10,Usually water in rooms is complimentary or if not at least the person knows it’s lrss than $5 per bottle. Not the case there. $18 per bottle. And no price on the menu. Plus a beer is $7 for room service so most would assume water would be less. The bar downstairs has them for $5. Rhen foe 48 hours the maid never bothered to clean my room (even after leaving by 9:30 am) and upon return it had the worst lobster seafood smell (from room service night before) that had permeated my luggage and clothes for over 2 days. Just disgusting. Try somewhere else.
30,Approaching this property and going in initially is very impressive but wow the very long walk from the check in counter to the guest elevators takes you through the casino and tons of cigarette smoke - YUK!Also I had packages sent ahead of me under my Fedex account and the FedEx office inside of the hotel charged per piece to handle and another charge to deliver. What a racket. I couldn't just send a box to the hotel and have the bellman deliver.The fitness room is AWESOME!
40,Have stayed here for years and love coming back. The location is great and California Pizza Kitchen is a great place to eat. Staff at the player's desk if very helpful. There were a few glitches this time with the charges not showing on the TV but eventually the problem was resolved.
10,"So after an exhausting drive all I wanted to do was put my items in the fridge and go look around the casino and experience the atmosphere. Nope you get charged if you touch and move any item in the fridge there is no room for your items. And if you want a fridge its $35 a day!!!! NO thanks I already paid for the hotel room and the parking and the ""resort fee"" come on."
50,Short trip to Vegas for work. Had never stayed at the Mirage. It was outstanding!!!! Quick check in at the lobby!!!! Room in excellent shape and the spa is outstanding! The steam room and water areas are fantastic - excellent cure after a night of fun!
50,This was my first stay in Vegas so I can't really compare the Mirage to other casinos. However I was very impressed it lived up to legend. I can't really comment on value though because I didn't pay for it.
10,Room was worn out and not fresh. Mattress was hard and uncomfortable. Sheets were dingy white and chair and half was worn out. Bath fan sounded like a generator running and shower was poor. Restaurants had long lines and less than average food. Room service says 24/7 but they never answered your call on Friday night. For a $296.00 Sat night charge and $250 Friday night charge plus the $37.00 resort fee the stay was VERY DISAPPOINTING!
40,My daughter and I visited Vegas for the first time in Aug 2018 to celebrate her birthday. We did not know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised. On checking in our room was upgraded with a view of the Volcano which was great. She also received $50 to use on drinks food etc for her birthday. We we so impressed with our stay that we have booked again for March 2019. Staff are very friendly and helpful.
50,From the moment I booked with Mirage I was kept up to date with emails. I was able to pre-check in which made check in a breeze. The employee at the Mobile Check In was extremely helpful. Confirmed all the pre-made plans. The cleaning staff were kind and helpful as well. We were on 7th floor. The convention facilities were nice and spacious for all the cheerleaders for our event. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would gladly stay again.
10,"AC was out in our room when we got there. Complained to service desk was told it was due to motion censors cutting AC off because of inactivity. Gave it a chance to cool off never did. Stayed up an extra 2 hrs waiting on maintenance to fix AC the SECOND NIGHT we were there (they were the only nice/professional people we encountered). Said they fixed the AC and it still wouldn't get under 75 degrees in our room with outside temps in the 40's all they did was change the filter. After asking for a fan we were told absolutely NOT! So then we asked for another room and were told absolutely NOT. Asked for a coffee maker and was also told absolutely NOT! Terrible dated rooms! And this was a room in the suite tower and was one of the more higher end rooms they offered. Everyone in the customer service department we talked to was extremely rude and if you had any type of issue it was always an argument instead of them finding a solution. Cleaning ladies will plow right trough your ""do not disturb"" sign on your door handle and enter upon will. We stayed in a sauna for 5 nights straight. I frequent Vegas often and have never stayed in a worse place. Even the Linq right across the street is an economy style hotel and it's twice as good! Wouldn't stay at the Mirage again if it was free!"
50,First time staying here and it was great!Staff was friendly room services responded promptly got in late due to flight delays and the availability of opened restaurants on a late night was good I was able to get dinner after I checked in without having to leave the hotel.
50,Thank you for your great service and comfortable beds my daughters had fun . just wish you had a place for young adults who are not 21 yet maybe a karaoke place with food. i think this would go great and it would be awesome for the adults as well
50,Lovely hotel nice pool rooms very clean nice views stayed for 3 nights good resteraunts staff very pleasant would recommend reasonably priced parking expensive but overall thourughly enjoyed the stay .
50,I have no complaints about the Mirage. I have yet to experience a resort in Vegas that is as beautiful and complete as the Mirage. It's my home in Vegas. Excellent restaurants theater shops huge casino floor with any game you could want...
30,Check in staff was friendly and efficient. Room was freezing at night. The heater did not seem to work at all. I informed the girl at checkout but she did not seem to care about anything other than collecting the payment. Bed and pillows were comfortable.Room was clean.
50,My trip couldn't have been any better... I enjoyed the room service everything was great. I thought the hotel would be tired and dated... I was wrong. It is in great shape and the staff is well trained.
50,Everything was beautiful. Nice cleaning I just don’t like the bar in the room when kids are going to be in there. I believe it should be put on by request. Other then that I love my stay can’t wait to go back!!!
30,Uncomfortable beds and noisy rooms you can hear inside and outside noise. Asked for an refrigerator for medication. My room had one filled with alcohol you can’t remove or you pay a restocking fee. Bed was uncomfortable as well
50,We had a great time staying at the Mirage. Having stayed in Vegas many times in amazing properties such as Wynn Aria Bellagio and others we had quite a bit of comparison scale. And with those first-hand experiences for comparison we did enjoy our stay at The Mirage.    The Mirage is very centrally located so it makes walking on the Strip in any direction very convenient. It has lots of very decent restaurants and the Carnegie Deli offered very authentic New York food especially the pastrami sandwiches.    The hotel overall is very clean and it's rather compact meaning you don't have to walk for eternity through the casino part to get to the elevators taking you to your rooms. Similarly the conference facilities are conveniently located.    The rooms too are very clean. They may be slightly smaller with ceilings that are a bit lower than at other high-end properties but they are still lovely rooms. The decor invokes Japanese motives. The shower pressure in the bathroom was absolutely spectacular and they had high-end toiletries. The beds were very comfortable.    Initially Ali Rizvi at the front desk (and he was very helpful) had offered me a volcano view room but on a lower floor so I requested instead a higher room floor overlooking the pool with partial views of the Strip. As soon as I got into the room though I knew that this was a mistake as this section overlooks both the highway and the industrial physical plant running the hotel and both of these factors make that low-level buzzing noise that is very annoying. So I called and requested a change. It took 3-4 hours but they did move us to a higher level floor overlooking the volcano and the Strip and we loved it. Did not have to stand in a line to get the keys for the new room.    Make sure to check out the volcano when it erupts as it's quite a sight! Also when you overlook the Strip from this direction you get no noise just the sights that are so typical of Las Vegas.    The Beatles Love show is at The Mirage and it's an absolute treat of a show so do make sure to go see it it's totally whimsical and lyrical. The theater has a strange setup and it may be confusing when you are trying to book your seats but rest assured that most seats will deliver excellent views. We were pretty close to the stage and we had spectacular views of everything.    We would stay at The Mirage again so happy to recommend it to others.
30,Very disappointed in the Mirage decline in quality. It has been several years since we’ve been there but it seems as though the property has aged 20. First we checked in early. Check in was very courteous and accommodating but once we saw our room we were slightly disappointed. It was clean except; the paint on window sill is bubbling there is cold air leaking in around frame the bed baseboard looks beat up from vacuuming there was a tear on the leather headboard by mattress the bathtub stopper was broken so I could not bathe while trying to - I see hair on the base of toilet bowl. There are no USB ports but there were RCA plugs/phone cord/2 outlets - outdated media options and no bedside plug options or outlets. It seems like money was invested to update the mini bar & snack tray with high dollar tracking though. While checking media charging options I picked up a box that includes cords to visually observe it contents and then had to stay on hold with front desk to see if charges would apply for simply picking it up. (They removed the charge). The outdoor pond at Rhumbar entrance was drained the tram to T.I. was out of service and we have never seen so many kids in a casino other than Circus Circus! I have written The Mirage directly with other comments.
50,Hubby was on business so I tagged along. This was our 7th trip to Las Vegas but our first stay at the Mirage. We chose the Mirage because of it's great location and reasonable price. We were not disappointed. The room was standard but nicely decorated and clean. The hotel was quite beautiful. The pool area was lovely with one pool and one hot tub open for us to enjoy in December! The staff were super friendly. There were plenty of eateries and bars to enjoy. The shops had nice items. The parking lot was easy to access and a quick trip from there to our room. We would stay here again for sure.
50,Excellent hotel customer service is wonderful rooms spacious and well kept. Variety of casual and fine dining 24 hour restaurant named The Pantry has great food and delivers to rooms. Visit the RHUMBAR for great flavorful rum drinks in a variety of sizes
10,The rooms are not very clean. They have veneered everything with glass over the old wood. Bathrooms are very small with old dirty tubs. Food is horrible for price. Staff is rude. We did win some money in the Casino though.
40,Mirage was a nice resort. Good variety of food. Clean and neat gaming areas. Hallways can be noisy at night but then that’s really the people. No coffee makers in the room was disappointing. We would be willing to stay here again.
20,I checked in on sunday the 9th and was not very impressed by this hotel.The food options though many were horrid and nothing was fresh so we decided to eat at the Dennys across the street. The hallway to our room was always littered with bits of trash and empty drink glasses. The room was ok but there was room for improvement the bed cover was ratty an torn the shower head plate was dislodged from the wall and the shower head had so much lime and calcium buildup it hardly put out water. I was stopped 3 times by security asking me to prove i stayed there cause I wear hoodies and jeans and everyone else was in suits and expensive clothes. All in all it was not what I would expect for this caliber of hotel/casino. My next visit I will stay and play someplace else.
50,The hotel was really good with a large room and great value as I booked the room through Dialaflight . Amenities very good too with a great pool free to guests .  We arrived very late in the early hours of the morning and we were greeted very well and checked in very quickly as we were very tired
10,"I had high hopes for this resort as it was first stay on the strip in a ""fancy"" hotel but my stay was ruined as soon as i walked to the check in desk and the information was never received. Staff was really rude at check in and even accused me of possibly filling out a form when i had the original document just in case. Room was filthy you'd think they'd clean it really good knowing that there was a conference going on with hotel owners from all over the united states that have the first instinct to check everything in the room. Of course on the morning of my checkout i was greeted by the mirage cockroach very relieved i took a shower the night before this critter made its presence known."
50,I loved everything and everyone. Great hotel to stay at! Will return! Had a lot of fun at 1OAK loved my table and my waitresses. My suit was worth every cent comfortable spacious beautiful really great!
30,Not Really Impressed. I drove to the hotel and could not unload my family at the front door and was forced to park at the parkade which feels like a block away when you have family. Housekeeping needs to step up. I would not bring my kids to this hotel too smokey from the front desk area to the elevators. Wish I could charge my food to my room. My first time to this hotel and I was not impressed.
50,The Mirage is a wonderful stop among the just north of central strip properties. Great and updated rooms Restaurants that you REALLY want to go to with a great variety of foods on premise. Customer service has really made a comeback at this resort as I was regularly asked how my stay was so far and if there was anything that could be done to improve it. I believe they are taking input from customers and making great changes.
50,We had good experience.Lot to do but as i do not play or try my luck with casino I just waked around with like friends and enjoyed the ambiance or the Hotel and all the entertainment of the volcano at the front of the Hotel Mirage. It was supper seen at night when I saw the volcano in action at night. I can feel the heat at where I was watching from. Awesome !!!!
40,overall good stay. will stay again. should provide microwave and should have access to refrigerator to keep personal items fresh and should have at least coffee maker. water should be provided at no charge.
50,"If you are looking for a team to excel in execution ""get 'er done"" and support your on-site execution efforts The folks at The Mirage are it. From check-in to check out restaurant staff and food quality as well as all meeting and business services - I could not be more pleased and grateful for such a positive overall experience for me and my team."
10,we stay at mirage every year for the National Finals Rodeo and i book the rooms months in advance every year. This year as a i am trying to check into the rooms they tell us the booked all the king rooms up and we would have to stay in a double queen? and to make matters worse the bathrooms were very nasty the tile by the tub has water stains and was broken with big chunks of tile missing. In other words i am done spending my money with mirage i feel their hotel needs a massive hospitality and cleanliness intervention and they are due for a face lift.
40,"My husband and I stayed at the Mirage for 3 nights: we found the staff veryconsiderate and helpful. The Secret Garden is a must see Cravings is a clean tasty buffet. All and all it was a ""winning"" fun visit."
30,Location is excellent. Staffing is very friendly. Room is noisy at night window needs to fixed properly. You can hear noises from the air conditioning from the roof top. Valet parking checkout was horrible experience. Clerk is very rude.
30,Well to Start off they messed up our reservations and our friends had to move rooms and then we still don’t have adjoining room or a view with the valcanno . And that was what we requested when we made the reservations/ payed extra we asked about the rodeo shuttles and the staff didn’t really know much about the rodeo and this hotel is one of the main Sponsors . Once we got in room that we’re not A joining Their was hair in the bag tubes and all the out let’s In The room were bad and wouldn’t charge our phones the rooms were very out dated
50,We stayed at The Mirage for vacation. The room was clean and met our needs. The only problem was I checked in online and waited the whole day for a notification for my room I never got. I ended up checking in at the desk at check in time and got the notification after that.
40,Early AM Truck Backing beeping was very loud every Am just at day break. Out side noises a problem. Over all costs in the hotel for all services was much more than we paid on our last trip out three years ago.
40,The hotel and staff were awesome! Great food! I have been telling everyone about the Carnegie Deli! Super comfy beds! The bathroom in my room could have been cleaner and my shower head needed cleaned to spray properly.
50,We have our sales meetings in Vegas every year in December at the Mirage and always stay at the Mirage. It is a great hotel friendly staff and good restaurants. The staff is quick to get us in and always flexible if you need a late check out.
40,Good stay room was nice and clean and well designed; also priced well. Casino floor is a confusing mess like all casinos but that's not going to change. Didn't have any issues with staff and everything in my room worked
30,Las Vegas in the last 2 years is changing with the hotels charging resort fees per night and also this hotel now charges for a strip view per night you would have thought this extra money would be used to refurb the rooms but no the baths and fittings are outdated and shabby. We have stopped here over the last 10 years and spoke to various people who were staying at this hotel and we all said the same thing.
50,Nicely appointed rooms exceptional service nice location on the strip. This hotel offers fine dining and all of the services necessary to make you feel like royalty while visiting Vegas. Very enjoyable.
50,We have been coming to Las Vegas for over 35 years. We have stayed at resorts all around the Mirage and just never had the chance to stay here. That was just dumb. The Mirage was the best place we have stayed. It is the right size in the right place with the right amenities all at the right place. The rooms are nice and well equipped yet not so opulent that they cost an arm and a leg. You can't go wrong here.
50,Courteous staff...good and clean hotel...apt location on the strip ...all of this summarizes Mirage...Had a good stay ....The essentials are a bit expensive in the hotel shop but who cares...Its Vegas...Also this hotel charges for any incoming packets for guests @ Fedex office...so please take note of it...Overall stay was good and is recommended...
50,Awesome time with brothers and nephews!! Servers at the sportsbook!! She was awesome. Sharon who was a servers in the am in the slots department was so full of energy!! Allyssa who was a server in the sportsbook went above and beyond to make our nephews remember this trip for a long time!! Thank you Mirage!!
30,I've lost count of the number of hotels guesthouses and B&Bs I've stayed in but this was a first for me - no tea or coffee facilities in the room. Every morning for a week I had to get dressed in order to walk the length of the corridor (a ten-minute walk) then ride the lift down to the lobby and then walk the length of the casino to get to Starbucks to spend $4 on my morning coffee. I'm not a morning person at the best of times and this fiasco did nothing to improve my mood.  It's fortunate then that the staff were all so friendly happy and helpful. It also helped that among the many dining options there's Cravings which offers a very comprehensive all you can eat fixed-price breakfast buffet. The chocolate croissant bread pudding is a strange experience.  Cravings is also the most reasonably priced of the many dining options at the Mirage and be prepared to pay for your drinks too. Averaging out at $8 for a beer buying a round of drinks will make you wince.  Then again you can always cheer yourself up by going and having a tattoo done. Oh yes the hotel/casino has an in-house tattoo parlour.  On the casino theme if you think you'll be able to use your spare change up playing the slots think again. The machines only accept the MLife rewards card (it's an MGM thing to get you to spend more money in its resorts; Mirage MGM Grand Mandalay Bay etc) or notes.  However to end on a positive note the Mirage is opposite a CVS pharmacy and a Dennys so cheap eats await and the CVS sells drink so that's all good then.
50,From the first time we check in til the day we left we were treated with happy smiling staff. The room we were put in was a pleasant delight that we felt this is our 2nd honeymoon!!!!! We enjoyed every second of our stay in Mirage. My husband who seldom says anything about any casino couldnt helped but says everyday that he loves the casino here all because the server knows exactly what he drinks and even brought him his drinks without asking what he wants....He is amazed with the service!!!!!
50,We enjoyed our stay at the Mirage. The room was nice the price was fair. We enjoyed gambling and the restaurants. We dined at Stack and it was delicious! The only reason I can’t give 5 stars is because their mini bar items are extremely overpriced! $18 for a bottle of water!!
50,Good location on strip. Bus stop nearby for strip plus walk across street to Harrah's and catch the monorail. Room very clean and easy to get to. Took advantage of mobile check-in and there was no waiting. Casino easy to get around and there is only 1 tower to deal with. Buffet was just like others -nothing to brag about but food was good and priced in line with others. Only problem I saw was the floor's Coke machine. The 3 days I was there it never got filled. There is a shop adjacent to elevators where I was able to buy a soda so not having coke machine on room floor no big deal.
50,Definitely one of my favorite places to stay on the strip. The rooms are amazing and there's plenty to do inside.    The other thing I like about it is its location you can pretty much walk to anything you want on the strip from the mirage.
50,Great hotel location is perfect easy access to parking. Lots of things to see and do. Shows are amazing “Love” show was worth seeing. Great coverage of the rodeo nice set up with live music nightly.
50,Stayed here for 4 nights the hotel was great clean and staff gave great service. The location in the strip is perfect and in comparison to the other hotels on the strip it seemed the have the best atmosphere and facilities. Would definitely book again.
50,Stayed during the National Finals Rodeo. The hotel is nice staff friendly and helpful. Location is great centrally located on the strip. Dining was great. However they really do not have a quick/fast food court which makes just getting a quick/lite/small bite to eat difficult. Check in was quick and easy check out can be done from your room. All in all a pleasant experience.
50,Great hotel that covers everything. Casino Shows Location and Value. Not the 5 star Bellagio or Wynn but in good shape and decent dining options. Rooms clean and staff helpful. For a group of friends was perfect.
50,"Don""t miss the daily free show at the Mirage Hotel & Resort (20:00 21:00 and 22:00) a mix of water light and fire. either get a room facing Las Vegas Blvd at the Mirage or you can walk by and watch it from the sidewalk - enjoy it"
40,It has everything that you would expect from a top resort in Las Vegas and it is also very central to a lot of other top locations & entertainment venues.Also the restaurants are very good and not very expensive
50,Very nice staff front desk housekeeping and security. Nice shows and restaurants. The slot machines and gaming area were very clean and serviced often. The casino wait staff were always nice and available for drink requests.
40,Made a quick stop in Vegas last weekend. Had a wonderful time with my Mom and Daughter. The Mirage is a great little spot with lots of action and cleanliness. Especially enjoyed our meal at LVB Burgers. Very Yummy!
50,Highly recommend The Mirage in Las Vegas. The Well room provides a level of peace and tranquility that normally can’t be found in any hotel. It’s like staying at a spa every time you walk in. Please check it out.
10,"We reserved a king suite only to be told that our room had been given away and the only thing they had left were queen rooms and that our ""resort fee"" would be waived. Well thanks. My finance is 6'5"" and a queen bed really isn't comfortable -- but okay...since you are going to waive $30 bucks... smh."
50,We love the Mirage. Great location comfortable casino Resort rooms are the best.....direct elevator! One of my favorite things is the breakfast there...smashed potatoes with breakfast....OMG!! All the food is great.
50,"I was nervous when I first booked the Mirage because I had read some mixed reviews - but I was not disappointed in my stay AT ALL. The front desk staff was helpful accommodating and easy to work with. We needed a fridge in our room for diabetic medication and they were beyond willing to accommodate. We called and asked for extra towels and they brought them up within 15 minutes which was great. The hotel was clean and beautiful as soon as we walked in. The room was clean smelled fine (I read reviews saying it was musty or needed updated - we never had this issue!) and the bed was super comfortable. The temperate was easy to change the bathroom was nice. One ""compliant"" is that the shower head wasn't the best but that's literally the only minor ""bad thing"" we had. The hot tub was great especially visiting in from Ohio in December. :) It was only open a few hours a day but it was better than nothing. Great location lots of places near by or within walking distance and Uber's were always nearby if you needed one. We never waited longer than 3 minutes for an Uber. I will definitely stay again if I ever come to Vegas."
50,This was a special trip for my husband and I so we really wanted to stay somewhere that we would enjoy. The Mirage provided an exceptional experience. From checking in to dining the casino gaming to the local events...we were pleased with every aspect. We will definitely stay here every time we come back!
50,Everything about the stay was great. The only thing that could make it better is coffee pots in the rooms. The restaurants we went to were all great- food and service were excellent. Beds are super comfortable.
40,Stayed at Mirage overnight. Room was nice and comfortable. Enjoyed gambling there because they had many of the slots that I like to play. It also doesn’t hurt that I won a $1200 jackpot! Overall had a great stay!
20,When we first arrived we got there very late almost 12am. After checking in and going up to the room I noticed a couple of dirty towels in the bath tub garbage still in the trash can of the room (bathroom trash was empty) and knowing we will be staying till Thursday decided to unpack and put stuff in the dressers. The dresser by the bathroom had stuff like a target bag with garbage in it pebbles that looked like some animal food. I decided to just use the drawers under the TV but just in case really wiped them down.I didn't bother to call housekeeping as again it was already late and after the drive and unpacking didn't have the energy. The cleanliness of the rooms throughout our stay was displeasing. There was another day towards the end of our stay where housekeeping left dirty towels and didn't leave any face towels. Called housekeeping and they came up to take the dirty towels and gave face towels. How is that missed? Other inconvenience we experienced is the valet parking. Initially checking the car in was fine but trying to take the car out the next day was a bit of a hassle as the lady in the small office of valet area couldn't locate me in the room I stated so she wanted me to pay before getting my car. Kept telling her that we had a room and we were staying for a few days and I wanted to put the charges on my room. Finally with someone else's help they found my information. My roomie had an emergency and we needed to extend out stay by one day. I checked me out and she was able to get a room for one night. When we finally left Friday her valet was comped for the one day at the front desk and when I was trying to retrieve the car the same girl I had problems with initially said that there was no comped reflected and that I needed to pay. I went back to the front desk and was told it was taken care of an shouldn't have any more problems. Getting back to the valet area the lady said that still needed to pay. I asked her to call the front desk and to please bring my car up. She wouldn't bring the car up until it was either cleared up or paid for. Such a hassle that took over 30-45 minutes with having to go back and forth to front desk and valet and then waiting for my car that should've been retrieved at least in the time that we were getting the account cleared. Either way I was going to get my car and I feel like it was being held hostage for $24.00. With this new process it's so inefficient and frustrating to your patrons. Should be included in your resort fee clearly as a patron we automatically lose at least $50/day with parking and resort fee. With these fees I at least expect a clean room at the very least!
50,The Mirage is located at the North end of the strip. It is an absolutely beautiful resort. Definitely a good location for families as they have the dolphin and tiger exhibit. The rooms were clean and staff was very friendly. The selection of places to eat within the resort was a plus. Overall we had a great experience at the beauty in the desert.
40,We really enjoyed our stay at the Mirage. The check in was quick and seamless with them offering an upgrade if we check in a little later which we took. Everyone was friendly and you got good bar service in the casino. The room was large clean and had a great mini bar. One thing that impressed me was that the maintenance was done well. I have noticed other hotels on the strip of the same age have done a poor job at upkeep. The view from the room was of the volcano so the was a bonus. Prices are good as well.After staying at many places on the strip we may have found a home.
40,If you want to be in the midst of it all the Mirage is your location. Vegas is all about the glitz and excitement. The Mirage captures it. The rooms are comfortable and cleaning staff seem to be working 24/7. Be prepared to walk. The conference facilities are massive as well.
30,The Mirage is fine. The location is unbeatable. The rooms are tired and need updates fast. There's some decent restaurants inside but it's hard to eat there when you compare the value to the other options at the Strip. Good gambling.
50,I requested a strip view room and had a topside view of the volcano erupting. (This is better viewed from street level out front.) The buffet is phenomenal although a bit pricey. The Japanese restaurant off the main casino floor was excellent as well. My only negative was my room was at the end of a hallway which made it a long walk after an evening of play.    Go see the dolphin habitat and Secret Garden while there. Informative entertaining and a beautiful walk about that is far different from the casinos etc.
50,Very nice Hotel. Great service and great dining. We enjoyed staying at this hotel/Casino. Casino was clean. The service in the Casino was great. We will recommend the Mirage to all our friends and family!
50,I have been staying there for years....always a pleasure to deal with a never had an issue with anything. The staff and facilities are great and offer a very upscale dining and environment to enjoy ..
40,I asked for feather pillow in the remarks when booking my room not the sponges- I did not get them. Would have rated a 5 but in 2 days my wife and friend were only offered drinks once playing the slots.
50,We love the Mirage. Conveniently located on the strip for easy walking access to the tram and the strip in general. Love that is just across from a crosswalk. Easy access to restaurants of all price ranges. Nice rooms friendly staff and an over all great experience. We only stay at the Mirage when we visit Vegas.
50,The overall decor was beautiful from the gardens and fish including the holiday penguins! Having the 2018 National Rodeo Finals in town allowed for a quick western cowboy make-over that added to the festivities.
40,Enjoyed stay. Clean excellent food and service. Thankful they honor military. We can’t wait to go again. Great location on strip however so many choices inside you don’t have to beat down strip. Food was fabulous. Staff always helpful and friendly.
50,This was such a great hotel for our first trip to Vegas! Our room felt brand new and fancy even though we got a good price for it. The staff and concierge were so nice and helpful. Francesca helped us book a Pink Jeep tour and she was awesome. Also Dexter and others at the baggage area helped us store our bags after we checked out so we could walk around. I loved how much this hotel had to offer such as restaurants venues etc. but it was not overwhelming like other Vegas hotels we saw. Siegfried and Roys Secret Garden was awesome too and I love how they’re helping the animals. I definitely recommend doing online check in and check out saved us a little bit of time and was super easy.
40,had a problem with check-in but still love this property. Our complaint about check in has been handled and we're happy with the offer. Will advise how our January 2019 stay goes. Restaurants and health clubs were great.
40,Enjoyed staying at The Mirage.  Price point played a huge factor in staying at this hotel.  Service was wonderful staff was so friendly patient and kind.    However there was an overwhelming fragrance in the casino area one that is nice but too strong in my opinion. I did not encounter any other fragrances at the twelve hotel casinos I visited. And if I did it was so subtle that I was unaware of it.  If walking through the casino you will definitely smell like smoke afterwards which is to be expected I guess.  The rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable. Although certain aspects of the rooms are dated. I stayed in both a suite and a resort tower king room. Each had nice views.  Both rooms were located on the upper floors with dedicated elevators.  Advance check-in is available via email along with mobile check-out.  The food drink and service at Osteria Costa was impressive. Highly recommend!  Overall a great experience. Located in a central location close to everything.
50,We stayed at the mirage for a second time with our first stay back in 2012. Again I cannot fault the hotel. We booked a tower king room and got a strip view up on the 24th floor which was lovely for our week stay. The casino was updated so lots of new machines to test out and enjoy. We had a great time exploring the mirage eating and gambling and will definitely come back soon for another stay
50,Love love the Mirage!!! We stayed here for the first time three years ago stayed at New York New York last year and couldn’t wait to get back to the Mirage this year!! Love the ambiance cleanliness and friendliness of the staff. The Still is a great location to watch football the gym is very well equipped great restaurants too!!
50,I don’t know if we could stay anywhere else! Everything was so clean and well kept. The restaurant selection was FANTASTIC there was a wide variety! The rooms were very spacious and clean as well. Highly Recommend!
40,Love this property. I am not a fan of pet friendly places but hands down this is how it should be done. No sign of pets anywhere. We had 2 rooms all which were clean. My only suggestion as far as the dart was concerned was that the Cravings buffet should be open sooner. Places are limited and there were hundreds of people looking for food. More restaurants in general would be ideal. Love the comfy beds ! Slept so well and the linens smelled great. Thank you Mirage. Until next time.
40,We had a good stay in room 25008 Dec 4-8 however every night there was construction taking place nearby and the backup warning beeper on the equipment was clearly heard in our room from 8pm until about 6am. It made for a very poor night of rest. We would wake up and move on forgetting to mention it to management but I would highly suggest you see if you can mitigate the problem!  Also the survey company you use does not allow direct contact with the Mirage and the Mirage website did not have an email contact for this type of feedback.    Todd
50,I stayed at the Mirage for the first time. I saw some of the negative reviews but my wife and myself loved the Mirage. It was what a Casino should be. We ate breakfast at the Pantry and had lunch at LVB and the Carnegie. I can’t wait to go back!
40,It was overall a great hotel. Great food. There is a 24/7 restaurant that had many options. Staff was friendly throughout the hotel. Great casino. The Shower wasn’t great the shower heads need updating.
50,Enjoyed the location food and atmosphere of the Mirage. The Terry Fator show was very enjoyable and entertaining. The Carnegaie deli is by far the best deli in Las Vegas. The pool area is the most relaxing and laid back in the area. Every one was so friendly and helpful
20,Bad stinky old rooms with no amenities at all. Just wasted my money here. No amenities available at the room everything was costly. No swimmpools were operational the room given was at the poorest location.
50,We lowered our expectations knowing this was an older strip property but was extremely happy with the rooms. They have been updated very nicely. Not just a standard update but you felt you were in a new hotel. No need to leave the property for food we enjoyed the Carnegie Deli LVB & took California Pizza Kitchen to the room the last night. All delicious :) Location was great for walking the strip. Volcano room isn't worth the hype bright lights shining up on your window distracting from the view. Watching it from street level is recommended.
30,Chose this hotel for weekend of 11/30-12/3 due to its location of the activities we had planned. Have previously stayed at Venetian Paris Excalibur and Luxor. I would rate this hotel very average not horrible but not good. Only plus was location for us. The hotel at check in the guest elevators are located complete opposite of the building so have to drag personal items through the casino. We also found the restaurant selection to be very poor compared to other places and mostly opted to cross the street to Venetian to eat. We did have their breakfast buffet for BOGO with MyVegas rewards so for half price was okay again nothing good but not bad. Our room was 3rd floor down a long hallway. It was dark and had a stuffy smell the whole way. When we got in our room the decor was very nice however again the air was thick and fowl smelling. We are from the Midwest and used to winter temps already so the thermostat only going down to 65 was an issue for us it felt like 70+ the whole time so we found it hard to sleep. Our biggest issue with the room however was the plumbing. Taking a shower was very loud and could hear air and water beating in the walls. The toilet also back-flowed every little thing it was very loud and gross. The highlight of our stay however was the Beatles LOVE show which highly recommend and the Secret Garden which was amazing! We got to see the baby dolphin and went as soon as they opened and had the underground observation room to ourselves for at least 30 min of watching dolphins play. Overall it is nothing special good location but we won’t be staying here again.
30,I have been to the Mirage once a year for the last six years and it is slowly going down hill.The rooms are shabby bedding very hard bathroom had mold around the tub everything chipped and old looking.The hallway always has trash in it and it is very loud doors slamming shut all night windows need cleaning the hotel needs updating with other hotels on the strip around the same price it will be the last time staying here unless something changes.
40,The Mirage fills the refrigerator and counter space with items that if you use them there are extra ordinary high prices attached. There is no obvious explanation to the cost or how the system works. I understand that if you lift an item and based on weight if it is not replaced within a certain time period you are automatically charged for the item. Carpet was dirty. After walking around in room then stepping in shower there was dirt coming off your feet indicating a very soiled carpet.
10,The lack of transparency and the ability to communicate effectively was not only frustrating but embarrassing. I purchased the Stay through the MGM email that was sent to me for black Friday. The offer for two nights included $80.00 food and beverage credit. When I checked in I was told I did not have that package. But I ordered it directly from my email sent from MGM. That took the act of god to fix and while doing that my second night stays rate went up from 52 to 95 without my knowledge until I checked out. I was at the front desk 4 times within my two-night stay because my room number was blocked from charges even though I had a food and beverage credit. I was told it was up to the restaurant manager to call the front desk to verify my credit. I went to lunch asked for them to verify the credit and was told by the manager of Pantry I did not have a credit. So I paid cash. Every single time I went to the front desk for help was told they needed to get a manager they would go behind the closed door and come back without any answers. This would happen a couple of times and then the manager would finally come out to talk to me. I felt like I was trying to buy a used car and Bubba had to approve my terms. Finally on my second day a manager lifted the hold and asked me to please not spend more than 80.00. Weird.... you have a deposit and my debit card! In the end my bill is still not right and I am waiting for that to be fixed as well. Next is the in-room water I purchased for $18.00. The 2.50 water I can buy on the corner is marked up to 18.00???? You are kidding right? $8.00 maybe but 18.00. Come on MGM. Then there is the information I was told the rooms were remodeled since the last time I stayed at the Mirage 7 years ago. The bathroom drain was rusted and gross the shower leaked Remodeled I thought and there were used tissues in the nightstand drawer.
10,If you want to get hassled by the security team. Be told 3 different things. Then get surrounded by them when you complain because they tell you 3 different things. Then get threat that they will kick me out when i'm a paying staying guest in the RESORT!!! Never will stay again.
20,Hotel was overbooked and they had me moving between rooms for a couple of nights. I had to pack my bag twice and wait until I got a room that I booked in advance. This is not how an hotel should treat his customers! The people in lobby have scripted answers and they have no intention to help getting the problem solved or help you feel better about it...
50,The workers make me feel so good and they always had a smile providing any asistance the check out person even help a little extra by proving all all the help I need it to make my check out even better
50,My husband and I just spent 3 wonderful days at the Mirage to celebrate his birthday in Vegas. This was our first stay at this MGM property and we experienced nothing but top service! From the moment you walked into the hotel/casino it gives you that old Vegas vibe which we love! The Suite was absolutely amazing with clean tasteful decor throughout the most comfortable bed we had slept in within the last few years a ENORMOUS tub that was jetted (I thoroughly enjoyed it every night) and incredible views of the Las Vegas Strip where we could also view the volcano show from the suite. From the warmness of the front desk during check in the constant care of their wonderful housekeeping friendly and FAST nightly room service (I believe his name was Francisco) and the helpfulness of the concierge desk. Every employee we encountered was attentive kind and very genuine. We frequently ate at Pantry during our stay (food was very good) and dined at Stack our last night which was AMAZING! As we were packing up today to head home we were literally sad that we were leaving and felt like we should have stayed a couple more days (that never happens with us). Overall we recommend staying at the Mirage when visiting Las Vegas. From the suites to the food and the overall service you definitely will feel special in every way. Thank you Mirage for making my hubby's birthday one we will never forget :)
50,The casino was very interesting and upbeat. But the best part was the lounge they have out front called Rumbar. We were able to drink and smoke hookah while watching movies on large screen TV's around the perimeter and it was just really chill and relaxing. The staff was really nice (and very good looking lol). Plus we could see the volcano erupt next door on the left and were within short walking distance to the Bellagio fountains and the pirate show. It's really the most centrally located hotel making it easy to accomplish all of your destination goals. I was staying at Aria at the time I went which was lovely but next time I think I'll definitely stay at The Mirage if for nothing else but Rumbar. Soooo much fun!! And a nice chance to relax from all the other craziness that goes on in Vegas lol. :)
50,We go to Las Vegas once a year and we usually stay at the Mirage. The location is hard to beat. We liked the bed. Neither of our backs hurt while we were there. The curtains stand open but my mother taught me to travel with clothes pins so that problem was easy to solve. I liked the shower. They had a grab bar to help people who used the tub. I wanted one to help me get in and out. I'm getting older. They have a nice gift shop. The drinks (cokes sprite zero and cranberry juice) were all $5. As someone noted in the reviews there's a drug store right across the road for better prices if not convenience. It's also right across the road from Denny's which is a reasonably priced meal. Cowboy week starts on Friday I hear and it was fun to watch them get the hotel ready for it.
20,I got sick from the cigarette smoke in the air of the hotel and room. In this day and age Las Vegas must be one of the few places in America where smoking is still permitted in public places. I really experienced is a terrible practice and counter to the business values of the Mirage. Making people sick or shortening their lives smoking does not create more revenue.
50,The Mirage is approx mid strip so getting around especially on the Duece is easy. Walgreens is right across the road for anything you forgot to pack or to pick up a bottle of wine.Friendly staff throughout the hotel/shops/casino. Comfy beds. The rooms don't have but should have coffee and tea to help get you going in the morning.
10,"I had a number of issues while I was there. The first room I was assigned had a very strong mold smell. I notified housekeeping and when the manager arrived he agreed the room had a musky smell. He scheduled the housekeeper to run the ozone purifier the next day. A few minutes later the front desk called and told me there was a water leak within the walls. I was relocated to another room and was given a free buffet at ""Cravings"".That evening I went to ""Cravings"". While I was there (Sunday Nov 25th at around 5pm) I witnessed a live mouse run across the sushi buffet. The entire back-of-house staff came out to do damage control and threw out the sushi. Another customer had filmed the incident and stood outside of the buffet warning other customers to not eat there. He remained there until security was called.Needless to say I had worries about what I had previously eaten there.Back in my room the shower head in the bathroom was rusted into place and would only spray against the wall making it a challenge to shower. The faucet trims were falling down.In the bedroom there was a latch missing on the window. This prevented the window from closing tightly and I got frequent noise from the departing helicopters."
40,Didn’t stay at this hotel (had done on a previous trip and very happy with it) but used it for the casino and breakfast buffet. Service quite slow in the casino but thought the casino had a good vibe. The buffet was the best value we could find and we weren’t disappointed great selection
50,I love the room there. The stay was very comfortable and relaxing. The Beatles' Cirque du Soleil show is located on the lobby floor (and that show is a must see!). The hotel is right next to Caesar Palace where you are free to explore there. My only recommendation for improvement: I wish there is a massage parlor there or I might have overlooked.
50,The staff went above and beyond to accommodate us. We requested a room change and was granted as per our request. Everyone was very helpful with us. They even holded the new roo. for us to return from the Grans Canyon at 10pm...I will sure recommend the Mirage.
50,Enjoyed a weekend stay at the Mirage. I have stayed at this property several times and have found it to be consistently excellent. Housekeeping service was on point this stay going above and beyond to ensure our comfort. The Mirage is our go-to hotel in Las Vegas.
50,The whole trip was perfect and one of the best parts was how accommodating the staff was to me. When I checked in I was greeted with smiles and they used my name. The staff answered all my questions. The rooms are very clean and the casino is lively. The buffet is very good and is good value as well.
30,We stayed here recently in 25th floor corner room facing the strip. The room itself was nice clean and modern with a great view of the strip. The room really exceeded my initial expectations. The property itself really needs to consider some upgrades. The hotel can make some pretty spectacular noises which kind of make you scratch your head & wonder about the pipes & infrastructure. Here are some other examples that signal need for renovation:  -elevator had a card slot for security in tower but was not functional (there were people stationed outside elevators in evening hours checking for room cards)  - lights out that designate floors chosen in elevator  -Sagging aged stained ceiling tiles in hallway  -missing pictures (empty nails) showing in hallway  -LOUD bathroom fans  -plugging in blow dryer blew GFC and lights/fan in bathroom went out when powered on  -Funky vanilla smell pumped through filters...especially strong at entrance of property    All in all for the price we paid it was fine. It’s in a great location on the strip and we enjoyed breakfast at The Pantry and watching football/eating dinner at The Still which are both on property. To me it’s all in the details...I can’t help but notice them however if these details do not bother you than it’s a great place to stay.
50,4 night stay in Tower suite. Worth every dime. Sports book is spacious and staff friendly. LVB has good burgers and sides to go. Cocktail service better than most casinos. Looking forward to returning
10,long lines for check-in and check-out SUPER high food prices (~30$ for a burger and fries) staff does NOT respect the DO NOT ENTER sign on door handle (what the hell is it for if not for cleaning staff?) people smoke inside the casino and no coffee in room!!!
10,My room was not ready at 4:15 PM on the day of my check-in. The staff told me to wait a couple of hours and return later. When I finally was able to get to my room the bathroom had mold on the tile floor and walls of the bathroom. These were never cleaned for the duration of my stay.
10,"I had the worst check-in experience last week at the Mirage. First they gave away my room and asked that I pack my bags and leave them with the bellman the next morning while they make a room available. I got a text informing me that they my room was ready at around 4:30 pm the next evening. When I arrived at the hotel around 9:00 pm they told me that my room had again been given away and I'd have to do the same all over again. When I refused to do so and suggested that they just leave me in the suite they were planning to put me in that night I was threatened with ""calling security"". All I did was refuse to go through the rigamarole again. By the way when I asked for a manager I found out that the person I was dealing with was the manager!"
50,My wife wanted to stay here I DID several years ago but I think this stay was even better than 10yrs ago. So many machines and dinning areas it has a great atmosphere staff very helpful very clean and decorated for xmas. Love was such a great show but sensory over load with all that goes on in the show just terrific.
20,Check in was horrible. I made a reservation for King bed but I was told that the room was given to somebody else. No king bed rooms available. The check in staff was very impatient. I asked requesting for higher floor (higher than 17th) and she didn't want to even listen to me. She told me i am already on the higher floor.
50,Came here on a trip with a large group of friends from the moment we arrived we received nothing but excellent service from the staff. The employees at the front desk were extremely friendly and equally accommodating and every staff member overall was very pleasant and helpful. The casino was very nice and everything the hotel had to offer was excellent. Not to mention that the hotel is within reasonable walking distance of many of Las Vegas’ other attractions. Will definitely keep this place in mind for future visits
50,Love the location. Love the staff. Stopped up sink in bathroom was fixed immediately upon request. VIP services went beyond to accommodate any request Buffet had excellent choices. Room cleanliness was second to none. Love the Mirage!
50,I have been to Vegas several times to attend conferences and this hotel is one of the best I have experienced on the Strip.  Comfortable spacious quiet rooms and a great selection of eateries and bars. Service was also superb and the very central location of the hotel meant that everything was easily accessible.  Highly recommended!
40,nice hotel very clean and right in the middle of the strip friendly staff  rooms could do with tea and coffee making facilities but  every thing comes arta cost though special beds at the pool cabana's everything extra. all places seem to be the same though
10,Stressful and UnhelpfulWhen we went to check-in we were told we didn't have a room then we were told someone else who we didn't know checked into our room then they said they can drop us into a room even after we gave them all of our confirmation info.
50,I stayed at The Mirage for six nights starting from Thanksgiving. Online check in was quick and easy and obtaining my room key from the self service machine just as easy which avoided the queue at reception. My room was excellent and spacious which overlooked The Strip. All the staff from maids bar staff waitresses and security were professional and friendly. This was my second visit to The Mirage within a year I think that speaks how highly I recommend the hotel. I hope to visit again in the future.
40,This trip was so important to me because I reconnected with friends from grade school and hoping to do it again with them in Vegas. Life is too short that I want to do this more with my high school friends too.
30,The hotel is still and oldie but goodie. But....if you are looking for nightlife and people watching this hotel is on the older side. It still keeps up but probably more for the older crowd. Rooms are nice.
50,Wife and I flew down from Canada to spend the week with family and new fiends from England. Amazing trip and plenty to do. Great hotel in the heart of The Strip. Clean rooms friendly staff and actually won some money.
50,We stayed at The Mirage Nov. 22 - 25 and had an excellent stay. The hotel was clean the room was large and clean also. Restaurants were great and staff very friendly and helpful. Location is great. All in all we had a great time.
50,Beautiful hotel and location staff friendly could not have asked for anything better Deuce bus service out front of hotel recommend using service it stops every couple blocks along entire strip Fremont to Mandela Bay $30.00 for three day pass unlimited. Will recommend Mirage to everyone going to Vegas. Slot machine paid well won over 10k on one machine!
50,The Mirage is in the perfect location right in the middle of the Strip. You can walk to just about any place you want to go.Everything is first class - the facilities food shows and lounge entertainment.
30,There were positives and negatives to our stay.  On the plus side the casino was well ventilated the parking was easily accessible and the amenities were plenty the staff was also very friendly and helpful.  On the down side the rooms smelled stale  the hotel has a worn feel in many areas. Also the food we ordered up to the room was below average the pizza was especially bad.
50,the hotel was clean and comfortablethe convention center was impressingthe services were excellentI would recommend this hotel to anyonemy first six days were for business and I was so impressed I stayed another 4 days for pleasure.
10,"Having stayed at your other properties Mandalay Luxor Delano Aria Vdara and Bellagio we have never complained. I thought I would make excuses for ""The Mirage"" since it was Thanksgiving but there were to many issues. On Thanksgiving I called guest services. I told representative I was a Platinum customer and I was checking in Friday 11/23. I told her this was our first stay at The Mirage (using an offer) and realizing it was going to be busy where do I check in. She told me to go to the unmarked door to the right of the Essentials store. When my husband and I arrived in your valet there was a line. I left him in the valet line and went inside to check in a little before 6pm. I proceeded to go into the unmarked door in your lobby. There was no line at the counter but was told by the person behind the counter she could not help me and that I had to go outside and stand in the priority check in line. WOW! So I left the secret room I was told to go into and stood in the other line. I asked that representative what is this Platinum experience I'm supposed to receive upon check in? She said it was a letter that would be left in my room? Come to find out on my last night while asking for a late check out that representative gave me a letter at the front desk. Needless to say checking in at ""The Mirage"" was the worst experience. I was left dumbfounded how I was steered to the unmarked room felt ridiculed by even walking in there then left the counter with no letter. Very unorganized. - Upon walking into our room 23021 the room smelled old and musty. Smelled like an old motel room on the strip. (You may want to walk in and check it out yourself.) This was due to the old air conditioner. Had to turn it off our entire stay. Even had to ask if we could open the bolted window. I brought some air freshner but it didn't help. The headboard was all scratched and tore up like an animal had been in the bed (were we in a Pet room?) The Bathtub has a big long rust stain in it. We left the maid our usual $20 tip and a note for the room supervisor that the air conditioner stinks and the room is old and musty."
40,find a way to reset the sensor on the fridge in the room so if I pick something and put it back it does not charge me cause I have to stand in line and waste my time to dispute that do really need that gimmick?
30,Don't get the tone of this review wrong because most of the problems with this hotel can be easily fixed. First I booked 3 rooms for a family vacation (4 months in advance) with my parents and in-laws 2 of which have mobility issues. Therefore I made several requests prior to arrival. Most importantly I requested 2 rooms as close to the elevator as possible. The other request was extra towels & pillows in my room. Well none of these requests were accommodated. The desk representative said that the hotel was full and they had no rooms close to the elevator. This would be completely understandable if I had not requested this by phone months in advance and again online prior to arrival. By not accommodating my requests my family members had to endure a long painful walk to their rooms.    Next my parents room had a sewage odor masked by a lemon-like scent. My in-laws room smelled like someone held a cigarette smoking competition in it (this is supposed to be a smoke free property). Also the A/C in my room only got cool (never cold) and you could hear water dripping inside of the unit.    We checked in after midnight and once my family got in the rooms they were too tired (from the long walk to the room) to try to change rooms (which was fruitless because there weren't any other rooms available).    My point is what's the purpose of booking early and making special requests if you get punished for checking in late. How hard would it be to block 2 rooms off close to the elevators. Moreover someone on this hotel's staff should've known the condition of these rooms before I arrived. Someone should be doing quality control inspections.    To sum everything up this hotel is in an excellent location. Besides the problems we had with the rooms they were descent sized. Also the entire staff was very friendly.
40,It was our first time staying at the Mirage and it was a great experience. If you have kids this should one of the top places to stay. Great entertainment and facilities available for families. Truly enjoyed our stay!
50,My husband and I our first time staying in this hotel and I must say it was amazing! The staff was great and helpful and the rooms were very comfortable! Our beds were always made and our room was always clean! The hotel is beautiful and clean! I would definitely stay here again!
10,I checked in late. I didn’t notice the mold til around 1 AM. I was told there was no other room for me to move to that night. The next morning I was moved to another room which had less mold. Then I was slightly upgraded to a room that was supposedly newer around 1 PM. Very dissatisfied. Was offered a free buffet as compensation for wasting my whole day
30,First time staying at the Mirage and last time. Been to Vegas half a dozen of times been in several Hotels and the Mirage is aging. The room was average nothing special. The ceiling in the Shower which is also small at one point was leaking and not properly fixed. The bed was very nice with lots of comfortable pillows.    For the price which they are on the more expensive side therefore the value is not worth it. Plus Vegas recently imposed this insane Resort fee which is very expensive per night. Not a fan of that.    To add we were a large group booked separately but a few of guys that were attending they screwed when they checked in as the Hotel gave away their Suite because a high roller was in town and didn't compensate them nor gave them equivalent accommodations for the number or people that booked and was going to stay in the Suite which was pre-paid. That was so wrong!    $8 for a bottle of Mermaid Orange Juice??? WTF.    Within the Casino which is also aging things are just average when you compare it to the new Hotels.    My advice for the price you will pay look at other properties.
50,We spent 3 nights after Thanksgiving to enjoy the long weekend. As usual we were treated very well by all staff especially Jennifer Lord and Greg at the High Limit Lounge. Our usual favorite eateries are CPK Stack and the Pantry.
50,I came for a business trip and had an enjoyable vacation at a fantastic hotel in an amazing location on the Las Vegas Strip.The restaurants various bars and the amenities at this hotel was fantastic i will give this hotel two thumbs up!!
40,First time to Vegas? Just be prepared for the distance from the entry to reception and then through the pokies to the rooms.    The Mirage is quite centralised in terms of its location on the strip. I reckon you can walk a fair way around without too much trouble.  The rooms are quite good clean and are a decent size. Bed was comfy even more so when you have walked all day and just collapse in it at night.  I had a strip view room and upgraded upon check in to the higher floor overlooking the strip and volcano.    Views were good of the strip just remember the strip isn't just outside your window. The rooms are a fair way from the hotel entry as all the Casino floor is between you and the actual strip. You may end up overlooking the Atrium and a concrete roof. In saying that the views of the other hotels and overall strip is pretty cool.    There are plenty of food options internally for all times of the day as expected in this kind of hotel / Casino.  Past reviews have warned about the minibar which you can't use for your own drinks or food or you will be charged a fee.    The hotel decor and public areas are really quite nice. The garden and waterfall in the main entry are pretty cool and give you that real resort feel. Then you see all the pokies and realise you are in Vegas.    You feel safe in and around here with plenty of both internal hotel security and on street security and patrols.    People smoke everywhere which I guess is bearable unless they blow it in your face.  Overall this is a great reasonably priced place to stay when in Vegas. In my view one of the more up market options available.    You can't miss the Volcano displays at night the presentation is blooming awesome.
50,Our Airbnb was a nightmare so we needed to find 3 hotel rooms fast. The Mirage offered reasonable prices clean and comfortable rooms and was located in the middle of the everything. We had a wonderful family vacation. They even replaced some worn mattresses in one of our rooms. The customer service at this resort is exceptional. It also seems to be a dog friendly hotel which is wonderful. It would be nice if they offered some vegan options in their restaurants but otherwise we were very happy. We will be back.
50,Cant ask for a better property in Las Vegas than the Mirage. Walking distance from other hotels and right next to the Fashion Show Mall. The entire staff is friendly and very knowledgeable about the property and what is nearby. The M Life program is one of the best loyalty programs out there and the dedicated check-in line is a big plus. Can't say nothing but great and wonderful things about The Mirage Las Vegas!
30,It is ok.You are forced to wait in long lines to check in.There is no in room coffee maker and a fridge is $80/night. There is no up front money put on your rewards card like some other hotels.Our room always seemed to be musty and damp even though we put the fan and cool air on.
40,We booked last minute and was worried that the prices were so low. We were very pleasantly surprised. We booked 2 rooms and our group arrived at 2 different times. There was a little confusion with the checkin when I arrived but nothing they could not quickly resolve. The front desk staff was so quick to check us in that I do not think I was there for more than 5 minutes. There was something strange with the first room they gave us seemed that the first checkin (at the mobile checkin location) the clerk assigned a room that was already blocked for someone else and at 11pm they were unable to get into the room where all their stuff was. The front desk was again quick to correct the issue they got their belongings and were reassigned a room on our floor. Even with all that hassle we still loved staying at The Mirage. Hospitality in Vegas needs to take the show on the road and work with other high volume destinations. They know how to do it!!    Rooms are very lean and comfortable. Maintenance needs to work on the room doors as they do not always close without help. This could be a security issue if guests are not paying attention.    We will stay here again in a heartbeat! Location and service are perfect.
10,“Malfunctioning” slots failure to provide shampoo and soap in guest room securing a deposit on our debit card yet not allowing to charge to our room special offers to entice us to get us there and then treated us like they wanted us to leave....
20,If you are a decerning buyer don't stay at the Mirage. It is not worth it and you will not be heard. We booked 2 rooms with 2 queen beds each - then at 3pm check in we were told there are not connecting 2 queen bed rooms. so we had to down grade to a lower floor and loose 1 of our 2 queen beds for a single king - then pay more. plus we booked and were charged for strip view rooms but on the 12th floor all we could see was the mirage dome and our hotel windows - no strip. WE were there for Thanksgiving and ate at the buffet - worst buffet I have ever had (and that was our Thanksgiving) - If a Vegas hotel buffet can't get the thanksgiving buffet right (really sad) Vegas is loosing it's value and enjoyment. The Mirage is going down hill fast.
50,The first time in 5 years we are all together. Couldn't have picked a better place to stay. The staff is wonderful and go out of their way to help and make you feel at home. The restaurants have unspeakably great food. Enjoyed every minute of our stay.
50,MY husband and I recently stayed here for our anniversary. We had a great room with a view of the strip. The restaurants were great. we also saw the Cirque De Soleil Beatles LOVE show. We were able to do so much at the hotel which was wonderful as he is in a wheelchair.
30,This property smells As soon as you walk in the fake overripe vanilla chemical smell assaults you  In addition 30 bucks a day for a frig and NO FRICKIN’ COFFEE MAKERS!!!! Are you kidding me.  I know where your damn casino is. You don’t need to jam it down my throat  Pathetic
40,Service was great and the staff always had a friendly word. The room was quiet and away from the hustle of the casino. The conference area was lovely and the food was very good. Overall we enjoyed our stay.
50,The mirage hotel was wicked cool!  Great first impression when checking in they have a massive fish tank wall behind the desk  The room was really nice clean and spacious!  Obviously as every hotel in Vegas is a casino the casino was right at the bottom of the elevators where you come down from your room. Plenty to do in the casino with a sports bar normal bars and a selection of restaurants to eat at
50,Fantastic trip with family. Love the facilities. Great food although rather spendy. Will definitely recommend to others. Hope to come back again. Everyone was very friendly and accommodating. Thank you
40,Great staff service. Main facilities are very clean. Great hotel location. Too much masking vanilla scent used on the main floor. That combined with the smoking and e-cigarettes make breathing difficult. MGM properties which includes the Mirage has implemented a $15 per day parking rate if you are planning to rent a vehicle while in Las Vegas. Bed mattress was not the most comfortable.
10,Beware of your bill and when ordering at the restaurants. I was given the wrong steak and side dish at Tom Colicchio’s Heritage Steak restaurant. At the bar The Still I was double charged on my card when my friend paid the bill!
30,This Vacation at the Mirage was not as good as my previous experiences at this property. One of the rooms smelled like mold bartenders were not attentive even with an empty bar and lack of slot machines that other casinos have at their properties.
40,This was our first stay at The Mirage thanks to a great deal I got online. The desk staff was extremely nice and helpful. The room was clean and beds were super comfy. The only 2 complaints I have about the room are:    1. No actual fridge for items only the mini bar fridge. Considering the price of these rooms I would expect a fridge.  2. The bathroom is tiny. The door literally touches your knees if you're on the toilet.    Overall the hotel was great and we felt welcome and safe during our stay.
20,The room had 8 plastic convenience store bags shoved in the top drawer next to the bed from the previous guest. The smoke alarm needed the battery changed at 7:00 am. It started beeping every minute. Took an hour to get someone after sitting on hold for 10 minutes. The shower handle was neatly broken off the toilet didn’t flush well and spontaneously overflowed while we were out. The room was super moist and the towels didn’t dry. Truly a disappointment. The resort fee is super high and so is the parking. Finally we were going to do late checkout for a fee. The night before it was $25.00 to check out at 1:00 pm and the next day it had skyrocketed to $99.00!
