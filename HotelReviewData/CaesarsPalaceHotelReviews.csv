10,When can I start. Well first the whole stay experience was one of the worst that I have ever had in Las Vegas. Second the hotel charged you for everything. If you moved an item in the mini-bar you were automatically charged for it on your bill. Then if you had the audacity to put anything in the mini-bar to keep it cold you were automatically charge $75 storage fee. They only had two working elevators and we were on the 66th floor and had to wait minutes for an elevator. There is no room service in the hotel. To order food you had to contact one of the inhouse restaurants to order (an additional $12.00 charge). The ice machine was two miles from the room in a nondescript room. There was one bar cell phone service in the hotel but the minute you stepped outside it went to‚Ä¶
50,Katherine at check in was amazing. So kind and helpful late at night and it was a great start to my trip. The room was gorgeous and clean with an amazing view. Will definitely stay at Caesars Palace on my next trip to Vegas!
30,Caesar‚Äôs is big crowded and cleanliness is borderline. The signage inside the hotel is not very helpful and I spent too much time wandering around lost. This is the first time I stayed in a hotel that didn‚Äôt have complimentary coffee in the room. I think they can do better for the hype and the price point.
20,We‚Äôve stayed in many Vegas hotels Caesar‚Äôs always seemed like a higher end hotel on par with the Bellagio or Wynn so we were looking forward to our stay upgraded our room a few notches. Well we‚Äôve been there done that now. First off they restrict ride share drop offs to the far side of the complex so your first experience is dragging all your luggage from one end to the other with very poor signage to the lobby thankfully the employees were very helpful. Check-in was long then a very long trudge back to our tower. The rooms were no more than ‚Äúok‚Äù. They are large his and hers bathrooms comfy bed and it stops there. Considering the upgrade we expected some amenities but there were none. One average size tv seemed small for the room onLy fridge is the stocked one.‚Ä¶
50,My first time staying at Caesars and given the outstanding service I received I will be coming back. Linda at the Diamond check in could not have been nicer and went above and beyond. The property has everything from great restaurants to an awesome gym.
50,If you going to Ceacars Palace Las Vegas Hotel Look for Emma.She is Very Helpful and the best Customer Service. She will help you What ever you can Ask for.. We Really Appreciate all the help Emma your the best.dont forget look for her when u check it.love this palace ü•∞ü•∞
10,I was shocked at how run down the room was. I have stayed at several other hotels with exceptional rooms and ammenities so when I booked Cesars I was expecting something similar. Instead my room looked like they took the used furnature from a budget motel to install into the room. The room was old all the furnature was scratched/banged up the carpet was wavy and half the lamps didn't work. The location and brand of Cesar was way nicer than the stay. Many way-better options for the same cost on the strip! That said it is a classic resort on the strip so stop in and see it. The restaurants were good but expensive. Just don't stay overnight.
50,"I had booked this weekend trip over 6 months ago and assumed I had booked an appropriate room for my wife and I to have a fantastic winter excursion. We were able to check in early but when we got to the room it was LESS than expected. I went down to the front desk and spoke with MARIA S about the situation. She calmly said"" talk to mewhat can i do to help"" putting me at ease and calming me down. I discussed the situation with her and at that point went to discuss with the manager on duty TAJA N. After less than 2 minutes of discussion they both came over offered me a new room at a discounted upgrade fee and then comped us lunch. My wife and I went to lunch and by the time it was over our new room was ready. To say I was flabbergasted with the upgrade is an understatement.‚Ä¶"
30,Nothing in the room was free. I have never stayed in a hotel where you have to pay for the water that is left I the room. Even using the in room fridge attracted an extra charge. The concept of this hotel is to get as much money out of you as possible. Beware of the mini bar.
40,Paid premium for the room since it was one night on a SATURDAY. Great property well maintained and very busy due to their show venues. Lots of folks were there to see Adelle which explains the room pricing. We arrived at 9AM and went straight to the QUA BATHS and SPA you can get a day pass as a guest for $85.00 which covers the entire day a great experience and mentioned in a separate review. Here you go for a painless experience: 1 - use the automated check-in at the KIOSKS or the Application on your phone. 2- Ensure you get your Players Card as soon as possible and use it everywhere. 3- When you drop your bags at bellhop tell them you will return to pick them up IF you choose the room delivery option- it's a WAIT! 4- BE careful with the mini-bar in the room- you touch it and‚Ä¶
20,"I love coming to Vegas but I will likely never stay at Caesars Palace again. Not only was my room not particularly clean but all the food options (restaurants and fast food) were ridiculously expensive. More than $38 for a sandwich dessert and bottled ice tea from a grab and go place is just stupid. Furthermore because the Caesars property is so large it is difficult to get out of the hotel to find a quick meal. I know that everything is more expensive on the strip but I thought that Caesars Palace was unreasonably overpriced. I had a comped room but the resort fees and parking were not comped and amounted to over $50 per day.    Regarding the condition of my room I was very disappointed both in the cleanliness and the maintenance of it. The bathroom walls had toothpaste and/or soap spatter all over it the shower valve was very difficult to turn the shower didn't drain properly the bathroom vanity caulking was old cracked and gapped and the light fixture on the desk had no less than an 1/8"" of dirt hair and dust built up in it because no one had taken it apart in years.    The location of the rideshare pick up and drop off is very far from check in. When my Lyft driver dropped me off at the main entrance he told me he was going to be scolded by the valet attendants. As soon as I got out of the car one of the valets came over and started yelling at my Lyft driver saying that he wasn't allow to drop off riders at that entrance. So evidently only those people that are paying $50/night for valet parking get to go in the main entrance to the hotel...    The one bright spot on my stay at Caesars Palace with the car rental from Enterprise. Both pickup and drop off of the car was quick and easy and the car was well maintained. In addition by not picking up my car at the airport I saved several hundred dollars on the rental.    Despite the fact that Caesars offers me free rooms at Caesars Palace I have rebooked my next trip to stay at another casino hotel off the strip."
20,Our room was dirty. The base boards were dusty and it showed as if it hadn‚Äôt been whipped down in a long time. There was something spilled down the wall and over the base board which had dirt stuck to it. So it was there for quit sometime. The bathroom door was dirty from people‚Äôs hand opening and closing it. This was dirt from a long time build up. The marble floors had drip marks all over them. Seemed as though they hadn‚Äôt been mopped from the past people‚Äôs stay. There were items missing in the fridge which I‚Äôm sure we got charged for. Make sure you read instructions on the fridge before you touch anything or you get charged. There is no place to store your insulin and if you remove items out of the fridge to store anything it automatically charges your room. Total BS. The bed was incredibly hard. As for the hotel everything was way too over priced. We won‚Äôt ever stay here again.
30,"Self check in is a must! Don't believe the amenities...the website says coffee maker is in the room. Wouldn't you expect coffee too? NO. You have to pay $20.99 for a ""coffee kit"". Top bring your own Keurig pods and creamer if you need it.  That was enough for the low rating after spending almost $300 for the room"
10,The staff that work in that property are the rudest ever!  The valet lady ‚ÄúTammy‚Äù if that was her real name and i said it because she hid her tag when i asked for it (blonde).She discriminated and screamed in my face without any reason. I have a condition and i cant hear well and she came up to my face EXTREMELY rude and defiant. NEVERRR EVER STAY AT THIS PROPERTY
30,The check‚Äêin process with Veronica's help was so easy. She was very helpful!  The room was ok. It was clean however the shower head was aimed so high it was hard to shower properly. Even maintenance came to try to fix it and couldn't. You also have to pay for anything extra including $40.00 a day for use of the refrigerator that is in the room you have to have a code to use it.
10,So we spent the money to upgrade to a Penthouse Villa. In every other hotel in Las Vegas we have booked such a room the concierge and butler service for those type of rooms has been outstanding. Not here. We texted our concierge (there is no one to call) to stock our bar and add some waters. Didn‚Äôt think it was an unreasonable request as we were told the room came with and equipped bar. Made the request at noon and by 10:00 nothing was done. Apologies everywhere no problem we will be there at 9 am. NEVER HAPPENED!!  I would expect this same level of service at a Holiday Inn express but not a 5000 dollar a night room.  Definitely my last time staying here.
10,He stayed at Cesars and it was not a great experience.We got locked out of our room because the cards did work work we had to wait 25 minutes outside room door after a long day outside seeing vegas.They tried to charge us for drinks we never used and the side lights in room did not work. On check out we dd explain this to check out staff her name was Andrea very rude and not interested in helping us on our complaints she really needs to be trained in customer service skills she even hid her name tag so we could not get it to complain. I would not recommend this hotel as they are ok if you don‚Äôt complain about anything but the minute you do they are very aggressive and condescending in our opinions on our stay there.
50,Arrived at Caesar's late at night greeted by the wonderful Katherine on front desk who noticed it was my husbands birthday so upgraded our room! Wonderful stay nothing too much trouble would definitely recommend! Until next time Vegas!
40,Great stay at Caesars- after a room mix up first night we were settled in King as reserved. Plenty of dining options staff was on point and as far as decadence you could do worse. Saw a great show Absinthe on site really didn‚Äôt have to leave for anything.  Gym was good although most treadmills were broken. Outdoor pools were either closed for the winter or maintenance but really who‚Äôs swimming when in Vegas?  Easy to matriculate through the casino once you have your bearings. Food at conference was mediocre.  Central to the strip and everything if you chose to wander.
40,Great hotel. Great location. The checkin process is a nightmare. Thank goodness Katherine helped us check in. The lines were so long so I went to express checkin and my ID wouldn‚Äôt scan. Katherine helped us get checked in to our two rooms in the Octavius tower. The rooms were beautiful. My adult daughter had a room in the forum tower which was worn and tired. The service at the Americano was excellent and the food was very good. I would give the resort all five stars except for the long lines at checkin and the condition of the room in the forum tower. It‚Äôs in a great location. They need to have less than $50 minimum bets on the blackjack tables too. Didn‚Äôt gamble as much here because of the table minimums.
50,Veronica at the Front Desk was very kind and helpful getting is into the tower and floor that we requested! Thank you Veronica! My husband needed to be in a certain certain near his team and she was very accommodating. She should be employee of the month for sure!
50,From check-in my check in Elpidio was very helpful letting me know everything about the casino and room what to do for my Wi-Fi and if I needed anything else. I was with a conference from Jasons Deli and had two personal days before the conference and then had it additional two days for our work event. I transition from one king room to a queen room the second part of my stay And Elpidio helped me through the process and made it so much easier. He smiled was very polite and represents your brand 150%. He deserves some recognition for all the help. He gave me during my stay. I will be back because of this kind of service at this hotel.
10,we had a lovely welcome at check-in from Daniel and we enquired about a room upgrade  He suggested a double up grade to a suite - which we thought would be lovely.  As i said in title the room was tired with chipped paintwork and frayed furniture but what was very unexpected was how dirty the room was - this was not just dust and dirt from a few days but layers of dust - perhaps not 3in thick as a previous review said but still not acceptable from a hotel of this caliber .We even had to clean out drawers of dust and litter before we put our clothes away. Receptionist tried to blame the house keeper who had serviced the room - which is totally unfair and unprofessional as the dirt is ingrained and old  I really wish I had read previous reviews before booking - but hotel obviously don't pay attention to poor reviews or they would act on them and improve cleanliness and have effective cleaning schedules
50,Gemma Ceasars Check-In Representative was outstanding in her customer service. She answered all my questions and made me feel good for selecting Ceasars Palace for our Accommodations! I'll be back soon!
50,This was one of our best trips to Caesars Palace yet! We go a couple times a year for extended weekend getaways with family and friends and thoroughly enjoyed our most recent stay. The casino is second to none the restaurants are incredible - Vanderpump Cocktail Garden is a must. And we cannot say enough GREAT things about Emma at the check in desk. She goes above and beyond and provides the most fantastic service. We are looking forward to our next trip for some great gambling food and drinks ... and seeing Emma once again!
50,I booked at Caesars for four days Valentines week and it was awesome!! Taja was the agent that checked us in and she was incredible. We asked her a lot of questions and she answered every question with a genuine smile. Everyone was very friendly and make us feel welcome!!    Definitely going back in April to see the STING concert and will stay at Caesars!!
30,Mom daughter trip    Finally our long awaited trip to Vegas! We get to the airport and there was nothing but delayed flight after delayed flight. Finally arrived at Caesars Palace and the stress of the day/ night started to ease with the sights and sounds only Vegas can provide. Checked into the room and my daughter told me the water wasn‚Äôt working. NO! After the day we had we just wanted to shower and go downstairs and have a drink and something to eat. I can‚Äôt even take this. I went downstairs to the front desk at my wits end someone is going to get a piece of my mind after the day that I‚Äôve had.  The lady at the front desk named Tangela I think could see how totally upset and stressed out I was. She was very calm and professional while I ranted about my day and now this whole bit with no water and how I can‚Äôt take anymore. She handed me a bottle of water and very nicely said she was really sorry (I really felt she meant it) and that she was going to take care of me. She compensated me and just her whole calm and understanding demeanor did make me settle. I guess sometimes you just have to blow and let off a much built up steam even if it‚Äôs at someone who doesn‚Äôt deserve it. After a very tough beginning it turned out to be a much needed trip for both of us. We had a great time and enjoyed the Roman statues and decor of Caesars Palace and walking the mall. Had a few nice meals at the Steakhouse there. All in all after a bad start turned out a good trip.
30,I've stayed at Caesars before and was very pleased this time not so much. In fact I doubt I'll ever stay there again there are so many other options that are much nicer places that are cleaner and have much better service.
20,"Check-in was great very friendly and got ""upgraded."" After that it all got worse. Got to our room which had a bathroom that smells like smoke. Called the front desk to have this fixed and reported a bottle missing from the liquor cabinet at the same time. They advised that someone would be up to fix it. We are still waiting for this to be fixed. We were told an extra fee would be charged for pool and internet....pool is not even open... My thoughts are no service.... no fee should be charged. We are currently still here and paid good money for the 4 nights. Cheap kleenex and toilet paper for a 5 star hotel is not what I paid for and the room needs a detailed cleaning and some maintenance as things dont work as they should. Please make this right before I leave."
30,Having read some reviews I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect but in fairness it wasn‚Äôt as bad as feared.  Got ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù from the Forum to Octavius Tower. Big room 2 large beds jacuzzi type bath separate shower cubicle. Yes all a bit tired and chips etc on furniture but the bed was super comfy no problems with the shower and not a bad view over towards the Bellagio. It was a bit noisy next to the freeway but not too bad.  Cleaned everyday with new towels.  Really disappointed with the resort tax but this appears to be a thing through Vegas.  Casino was always busy and felt so much noise and smokier than the other hotels for some reason??  All in all though we were relatively pleased with our stay
10,We showed up at the Ceasars Palace as scheduled with a reservation for a room with 2 beds and a view of the strip on Saturday February 18th as planned. The hotel confirmed they had our reservation but didn't have any rooms available. They sent us from Ceasars Palace to Nobu who sent us back to Ceasars Palace who then sent us to the Horseshoe. The Horseshoe sent un back to Ceasars Palace because that's where our reservation was. After 4 1/2 hours of being run around they sent us to a restaurant to wait for a room that became available on Sunday February 19th. That room had a single bed and no view and no water due to a pipe issue. Ceasars Palace said they would not charge us for Saturday night but then claimed they couldn't refund us directly because we booked through hotels.com. We filed a claim through hotels.com to try to get a refund for just Saturday night and Caesars refused our request. We ended up spending $698 for a to hang out in the hotel lobby Saturday night and to add insult to injury we were put in a room on Sunday that wasn't what we requested or paid for. This whole nightmare was completely the hotels overbooking issue! When you have a prepaid reservation you expect to have a room for the night you show up not then next day. We were 1 of 4 couples/families that were getting the run around just trying to check into our room so don't think this was a small oversite by Caesars! They were running us around waiting for someone to check out at 4am to make the first flight out of Vegas Sunday morning.
10,"I wrote a glowing review of Caesars Palace a few years ago but all has changed! I've stayed at Caesars off and on since 1976. This visit was very disappointing. First no security at the elevators (we had that at the MGM in September and Paris last summer). Further we were approached twice for handouts...one wanted breakfast money and the other wanted ""get home"" money. This has never happened to us before. Second resort fee of $52.10/day for pool and internet. And the fee is hidden upon booking. We are usually comped or receive very low rates because we gamble. Third room service is through an app using the restaurants on the property. If you want room service to bring you a bloody mary and eggs benedict at 6am...or 6pm...forget it. Again got exactly that when we stayed at the MGM in Sept. Food is way overpriced and arrives in a cardboard box with plastic cutlery. Try cutting into a steak with a plastic knife. Fourth and finally shabby rooms with old furniture and fittings. We will not return. Made us sad as we have some great memories."
50,Katherine checked me into my room! She is fantastic at her job and also has a great personality! I thoroughly enjoyed conversing with her! She was also very helpful and gave me superb directions on how to get to my room. Keep up the great work girl! Caesar Palace is fortunate to have you!    - The other girl from Cali‚ù§Ô∏è
10,"Worst experience I've ever had at any hotel yet alone a ""resort"" the rooms do not look as they do online. Bait and switch on the cost of the room due to a 50$ a day resort fee on top of the listed price per night. Grey drab and horrible interior design. There is no coffee in the rooms even though there's a coffee maker. DO NOT USE THE MINI FRIDGE if you so much and touch a bottle in the fridge you will be charged. There is no personal use of the mini fridge allowed which means you cannot store leftovers or anything in the fridge. We used the fridge before reading the sign to store some leftovers and we're charged 150$. Man was bleeding out near the elevators and bloody footprints we're left in the hallway for 24 hours. Absolute worst hotel experience don't stay here!!!"
10,Our room wasn‚Äôt serviced for 2 days and the staff hung up on us when we tried to lodge a complaint. Got to room at 12.05 and the room wasn‚Äôt serviced. They sent someone up who went to tidy the bed with the same sheets and we asked that the sheets be changed. After not being able to get through to manager I had to walk downstairs to front desk and all they offered was a discount of $52 for some fee I was paying on top of room charge. Took  Photos of room at 12.15 when someone came to tidy it up. Photo tells the story. As we had 2 bookings at hotel I went to cancel the second booking and they refused to accept me cancelling even though it was under my name and would only accept with the booking number which was done by travel agent. so I had to reach out to agent to cancel the booking. What a disaster and the worst service I have ever experienced. This is absolutely the worst service I have ever experienced and would never recommend staying at hotel if you want to come to you room unserviced.
50,Maria at the front desk check in was awesome! She handled our special request with efficiency and professionalism. She should be recognized for her great work and attitude. We highly recommend the spa as well.
50,Our family of 6 checked in early and went to the front lobby for early check in and request for connecting rooms. This was a holiday weekend and we came on a Saturday so we understood our request for a connecting room is low. However Emma was able to grant our family of 6 a connecting room which was so helpful! She spent a good 15-20 minutes checking for availability and even gave us a personal call once rooms were available.
20,Last time I stayed at Caesar‚Äôs Palace was probably 12 years ago and it was The Hotel to stay very classy fully renovated clean  everything was just very nice.  This time my husband‚Äôs secretary choose this hotel. Since it was business we did not care thought it was ok .    Its a huge disappointment to come back and see the hotel has downgrade its standards .  Service at check in its average I had to ask for an upgrade instead of they offering one like other hotels.  Lady was probably tired because the check in was full!  Ended up in a suite in Octavius Tower and for our surprise furniture very worn out including bathroom cabinets and hesitated wether they clean the carpet.  No dryer in the room no bathrobe or slippers anywhere .  That is how it used to be.  Now you can‚Äôt talk to anyone to request room service housekeeping etc unless its very necessary  otherwise its a virtual concierge where you exchange text.    Requested to get the room to be clean first day on the phone and nobody came  second day requested it again and some one came but no dirty glasses or empty boxes nor coffee cups where taken away only the bin garbage ahhh but there is a little envelope for housekeeping tips.    Definitely there are other options on hotels in las Vegas much better than this one for a small difference in price.    Will never come back to this hotel.
10,If you are looking for a nice shower with zero water pressure look no further. I brought the no water pressure issue to the attention of staff 4-5 times and they said they would send an engineer to look at it. Never heard anything more from staff. When I asked them if it was fixed they said the had not heard anything from engineering. They never offered to change my room or anything. I‚Äôm guessing cause the water pressure is not good elsewhere. If you are looking for a soft piddle of water in your shower then stay there. But if you want a better experience there are plenty of other hotels on the strip.
20,Unfortunately I have to say I had bad experiences. Room smells so bad carpet extra dirty. Also the valet is only for people who has gold card even I was willing to pay my $50. Definitely not recommended. Never again‚Ä¶.
40,This hotel is iconic. The entrance lobby is truly stunning. The check in was very quick despite the massive queue. We were on the 50th floor and facing the rear of the hotel so the view wasn‚Äôt good. Within a minute of leaving the busy casino area it went quiet and was quiet in all the corridors. The room was a little old fashioned but it was enormous immaculately clean and very comfortable. The heating/air conditioning worked really well. There are notices warning that you will be charged for even moving any of the snack/drink from the tray or the fridge. There‚Äôs even a charge fir using the fridge to cool your own food. We got ice from the ice rooms down the corridors. Breakfast in the hotel‚Äôs cafe is expensive. I had a waffle with fruit and Nutella and a coffee and my husband had a small dish of porridge and a coffee. The price was $50. The all you can eat restaurant looked lovely had big queues and was expensive too.  Ceasar‚Äôs palace is in a superb location. Right in the centre of the strip. Worth every penny.
50,Im staying at Caesar‚Äôs and Katherine helped make the stay amazing. She gave us great recommendations. The rooms were very clean and service was great. Overall she made our stay at Caesar‚Äôs feel very welcoming!
20,I have stayed at Caesars before and enjoyed our stay but something has changed for the worse.    To start with they now charge for self parking. This never happened in the past. We got the bargain rate of $18 a day. Then only two of the parking garage elevators were working so there were always about 20 people waiting to get on the elevators.    In the rooms there are no microwaves or refrigerators for you to use. On the mini bar refrigerator there is a warning that is you try to use it for personal use you will be charged $75.    In the casino it was extremely crowded and on a Saturday night most the restaurants closed before 11 causing huge lines at the remaining restaurants that were open.    The hotel has taken a turn unfortunately. Used to stay here for concerts at the Coliseum which is still an amazing venue for a concert but the $15 for a beer and $32 for a margarita it is way over the top for us.    Still a beautiful hotel but not what it used to be.
50,Las Vegas Caesars is always the place to stay! The team member Hitomi at Diamond Registration was AWESOME! She was very pleasant and helpful. We decided to upgrade to a nicer room to celebrate our anniversary
10,So I booked a long weekend to celebrate my husbands birthday and have never been so disappointed in a hotel. We arrived around 12:30 and the check-in process is a total up-sell. Normally a hotel will say let me check and see if your room is ready but no they said if you want to check-in early it will cost you $30. Oh and the only room I have has 2 queen beds (I reserved a king room). Then she said if you want a king you will need to upgrade to a better view which will be an additional $100 a night. Oh and the best part is when we get to the room there is a Kuerig coffee maker but no coffee pods. I call down to the desk and they tell me it is an additional $20 for coffee pods! Give me a f$%^ing break! Like they are not going to get enough out of us this weekend??? I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. Nickel and dime you to death.
50,The rooms staff and amenities at Caesars Palace are fabulous. Comfortable beds clean rooms and great restaurants. Checking in Cyrenna was very helpful (and patient) and provided us with key information that was useful throughout our entire stay. Thank you Caesars Palace for making this retirement celebration trip awesome!!
40,When I initially arrived at the hotel I was not informed about all of the included benefits of being a Seven Stars member. It was only after meeting with an outstanding Seven Stars team member Hitomi that I was assisted with a room issue and she explained all of the points available to me and how and where I could use them. She made this trip a hit!
20,"I stayed from Feb 13 - Feb 17 2023 room 905 at the Palace Tower. (If you are the person in charge and reading my review this is for your reference.)    The room only got cleaned on Tuesday and that's it. I didn't have the ""room occupied"" sign at the door and still didn't get cleaned on Wednesday and Thursday.  The most ridiculous thing of all. It's the kiosks at the sportsbook were not working at all from Feb 13 - Feb 16 right after the superbowl. You read it right: completely out of service. The guys at the sportsbook told me he had no idea when it will work again. (It ended up working again on Feb 16 afternoon so it's malfunction for 3 days.) It's not just the kiosks at Caesars Palace but any casinos that are under Caesars. I had to go to Bellagio to use the Kiosk since it's not under Caesars.    I always stay at Caesars Palace because of it's reputation and location. This is the 2nd time in a roll the room doesn't get cleaned in a daily basis. I don't understand why I have to contact the room service in order to get cleaned.    I will still book Caesars Palace again next time again just because the location is center to everything. But if this happens again I will seriously consider changing to a different hotel on my next visit in the future."
10,I used to love Caesers- the last time I stayed was before COVID hit. I have stayed at other hotels in the strip lately and decided to come back to my favorite. However sadly this hotel has declined. The lines to check in are very long. Once I got to my room I found it had not been cleaned from the prior occupant. Bed unmade towels on the floor. Had to go back down to get another room. The whole process from arriving to finally getting a room was an hour. My new room had a bad smell and felt dirty. In the elevator I heard of other people having room problems. I will say they gave me $100 to use at a restaurant on site but this is not the Caesers of the past. One plus- the American cafe is excellent for breakfast.
50,Initially when I arrived for my 5 night stay I had an issue with my room and I went through about 3 reps for assistance and when I broke down and spoke to Tangela she was very understanding and made EVERYTHING right! My last few days here will be well worth my stay. Tangela was the most professional team member I worked with and she was persistent sincere and was over top on making sure my stay would be enjoyable. TANGELA IS AMAZING!
40,Busy central hotel with lovely rooms and facilities. Unfortunately they have a small print policy so you‚Äôre not guaranteed the room you book - even if you‚Äôve paid for an upgrade to the Laurel rooms and a strip view so be aware‚Ä¶also whilst we were there our headphones were moved to the side of the tray by housekeeping‚Ä¶naively we didn‚Äôt put them back on as we hadn‚Äôt touched them we took a photo to use if there was a problem at check out but there wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶yet we‚Äôve just got home and been charged!! Bitter taste left after an amazing holiday x
40,The Caesars Palace is what we expect from a Vegas hotel: A lot of people decent rooms good elevators nice decoration excellent location and a lot of things to do aprt from the Casino itself. The problem is that the hotel is understaffed so expect lines if you need anything. I opted for the late check-out so I was not able to finish the check out by myself.
10,I have stayed at Caesar‚Äôs many times. This time was terrible. So disappointed.    My stay started with an attempt to check in just a little bit early (since I was there for business conferences being held at Caesar‚Äôs and I wanted to get an early start) however the front desk told me that it would be an extra $30 charge. I couldn‚Äôt justify the extra cost for such a short time so they told me to come back at 4:00. While I thought that was a little ridiculous fine. I went back at 4:30 and waited in line a second time. This is where it starts to get extra aggravating my room still wasn‚Äôt ready. So now after telling me I could pay extra to get my room earlier the room that I already paid for wasn‚Äôt ready at their promised time. Whatever I let it go and they said they would email me when it was ready. Went to some more scheduled conference events. At 7:30 I needed to change clothes but hadn‚Äôt received my email yet so I decided to go wait in line a third time and inquire about my room. When I finally got up to the desk/counter the person told me that he was sorry and he would get me a room right away. He took quite a long time with lots of typing and finally was able to get me a room. He told me that for my inconvenience he would upgrade my room and gave me my keys. Fantastic right? After getting to the room not so much it was the same room I had reserved and already paid for. Not an upgrade at all. Again I thought whatever I‚Äôm not here for the room I‚Äôll just let it go. Wasn‚Äôt worth waiting in line again and complaining as I didn‚Äôt really plan to spend much time in the room anyway.  Here is where it takes a turn though after a somewhat late night (it‚Äôs Vegas) I was awoken super early to what sounded like a jackhammer followed by someone using a sledgehammer. That repeated and repeated. That early wake up call went on for a good hour. Was really aggravated and decided to record it on video in case I wanted to go to the desk to complain. Found out from some workers that they were doing maintenance on a stairway across the hall from my room and were going to be a while. So I got to enjoy that noise until I just decided to start my day extra early with extra caffeine.    Caesar‚Äôs used to be one of my absolute favorite places to stay. They definitely were not even acceptable this time. When I‚Äôm back in Vegas in 6 weeks I‚Äôll be staying someplace else.
40,Comfiest bed ever! It was honestly the best nights sleep we had had in weeks. The room was cleaned to a very high standard. Staff were friendly but one small thing that stopped me from giving it five stars - On check in the staff seemed pretty confused with their own system. Another meme er of staff did come help but a few errors were made not a big deal as they were resolved but it did take quite a long time to check in    Also just an FYI to any other brits you can smoke in vegas casinos not an issue for our trip but did notice everything in the suitcase needed a wash because if did smell of smoke (even things we didn‚Äôt wear) but honestly I‚Äôd stay here again in a heartbeat.
50,Emma at Caesars front desk was amazing! She took care of us during a weekend trip! She took her time to take of our party and made our experience feel very special. We got there early and let us know when the room was ready. Our bags at the bell desk were taken to our room automatically so we were completely satisfied with the experience! Thank you Emma!
50,My mom and I spent a night at Caesars Palace for the Adele concert. After a stressful time getting to the resort battling traffic and running late we were quite anxious to get checked in. We got Julia Chan and she was very calming and assured us we would get there in time and get us a room close to the venue. She asked if we wanted to upgrade our room and we declined (we just wanted our keys as fast as possible and worried we still were not going to make it). However she upgraded our room and gave us a surprise of a lifetime when we got a suite we were not expecting. She was fabulous the room was fabulous and it was an experience that my mom and I won't ever forget. Thank You Julia Chan!
30,Only place in Vegas I was charged for a drink while playing video Poker......I was keeping busy while waiting for reservation so I sat down and put a 20 in the machine and ordered a beer. It came with a 12.00 beer. I can honestly say I never found a cheap beer anywhere in Vegas 12.00 seemed to be the standard.
50,I‚Äôve been to Vegas plenty of times before but this is the first time I received such outstanding service while checking in and this was all thanks to Emma. Emma went above and beyond to help us get connecting rooms during a busy holiday weekend. This creates for a memorable weekend for our family as we can all be together. If you stay at Caesars and is lucky enough to get Emma when checking in you‚Äôll be in good hands! Thanks again Emma.
50,Emma went above and beyond to find us connecting rooms during a sold out three day weekend! This interaction along will have me staying at Caesar‚Äôs Palace again! I have never had someone work this hard to find us rooms.
10,Room and amenities need updating. Lack of outlets drawers laundry bag and very cheap toilet paper and tissues. Poor Wi-Fi and tried to charge you for a third device when you barely got service for any device very random.  Had a Keurig and cups in the room but no coffee pods or condiments. Could purchase from min bar for an exorbitant charge. Even a Motel 6 provides all these for free!  Never could figure what we got for our pricey resort fee.
50,Beautiful hotel located right in the heart of the strip with very easy access to lots of key venues including theatres and shopping centers. Room in Augustus tower was spacious very comfortable and clean. All staff were very helpful & friendly. Would definitely stay here again.
50,We checked in for 4 days for my 40th birthday. We deliberated on a hotel for a long time. There are so many on the strip. We arrive around 1.00am exhausted but we‚Äôre delighted to be met by Katherine. She checked us in swiftly she was polite and informative. After meeting Katherine we knew we had chosen the correct hotel for us. One employee can make a difference in a huge chain.  Many thanks  Richard
50,Employee appraisal Katherine front desk  Our party of 4 checked in on Monday 13th Feb/ Tuesday 14th early hours. After having a disastrous start to our holiday due to flight cancellations and lost luggage we had the delight of getting checked in by Katherine at the front desk. What a ray of sunshine! Quick efficient and extremely informative. Generally a great person to front a business. An employee worth her weight in gold.  A great stay!  Many thanks  R & N Gordon
20,Bed was comfortable and the bathroom was nice and spacious - however very dated room. Did not feel clean. There were holes in the sofa seating the curtains did not work and the TV in the bathroom also did not work. Lighting was very low and the room very dark. Grundy carpet as well. The elevators were also very rickety ceilings tiles loose and broken frames in the elevators. Also must say - rather dodgy clientele. Would not stay here again or recommend.
30,We got charged for opening the mini fridge!!!! Over 200 and a 75 door restocking fee for things we didn‚Äôt consume! We opened it to see if we wanted something my small kid opened it to look and touched some stuff it‚Äôs a scam they have a sign but it‚Äôs no visible and they don‚Äôt tell you at check in !
40,Room and bedding were very nice. BUT BEWARE!! DO NOT touch anything in the refrigerator mini bar. DON'T even lift it up. They are censored and they will charge you. We took out a couple of waters and beers to store our leftovers from dinner and put them back the next morning. THEY CHARGED US $75.78 even though we put them back. Expensive lesson.
40,Nice room. Quiet and clean. No coffee maker in room so can never give a 5 star rating to any hotel without one. Horrible view. The casino area was mostly smoke free which is a plus over other casinos.
10,Apparently servicing is now optional even when you ask for the room to be serviced at checkin. Day 1 the room was not serviced. I thought maybe it was because I didn‚Äôt leave the light on to let them know to service the room. Day two we turn on the light requesting to ‚Äúmake up the room‚Äù and we return at 730pm and the room STILL is not serviced with dirty towels. I call guest services and they say ‚Äúthey still haven‚Äôt gotten around to this room.‚Äù At this hour? You got to be kidding me. They have the nerve to charge a resort fee and are not servicing the rooms after two days??? This is a racket the room was average at best compared to the Venetian. We will not be back!
50,I had an urgent need for assistance with a task and nowhere else to turn so I searched for a staff member near the front desk. There I encountered Chloe who informed me that my request was outside of her capabilities. Seeing how desponded and desperate I was she immediately began investigating ways she could help me. It took her trying several different approaches before ultimately finding success. While it was well outside of her job responsibilities to help me and somewhat challenging to resolve my issue her interest commitment and willingness to help me saved me from some from some serious consequences. I am extremely grateful for her generosity and assistance - most importantly appreciative she did not turn me away as I believe many other people would have. She is an asset to Caesars and her excellent customer service won over a new ambassador for the brand. Thank you!
20,The room was not the cleanest. There was a 3 inch layer of dust on the air filter for the room. When we turned on the tub black stuff came out of the jets. There was a layer of dust on the purple velvet couch and the windows were dirty. I was hoping for a clean room for the price I paid. When I left Tangela helped me out and was able to get me some money back. Overall not a completely terrible trip.
50,I had a great stay at Caesars thanks to Katherine! She set me up with an amazing room and recommendations for dinner and dessert. I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better welcome to my stay. I highly recommend!
50,Weather was cold. Go later in the year. Zanda at check in was Awesome. Very pleasant and helpful. Not many interesting shows but shopping especially at Caesar‚Äôs was AWESOME. Would definitely come again.
40,Excellent location and amenities a little noisy from party goers late in the night but this is Vegas  furniture a little tired !!!  All staff very friendly and accommodating  Loads of activities if you know where to look so checking out trip advisor is recommended
40,During our visit to Caesar‚Äôs Palace the biggest thing that stood out was the customer service of the people who work there! Chloe and Liz at the front desk particularly stand out. They were very helpful extremely kind and truly understand the art of the hospitality business.  I would highly recommend coming here
20,"Paid for the upgraded room in the Octavius Tower. The room was very worn down.  All the furniture was badly scuffed paint and varnish rubbed off. The furniture was old and visibly worn.    Carpet needed a cleaning badly very visibly stained.  Bathroom was clean. Bed was comfortable.    They nickel and dime you for everything. They charge you a $50 ""Resort Fee""  But then want to charge you an extra $15 for Wi-Fi for more than two devices... Pretty awful business practice. No bottled water in the room [should be included in a resort fee]  Bathroom ammentities very basic. Bad shampoo and conditioner.    Overall stay anywhere else and come to Ceasars to gamble or just to see it. Dont stay here its not worth the price for how run down the room is and all the nickle and diming"
50,Absolutely love it ! Jessi front desk staff was helpful and friendly! Room was spacious and clean! Delicious food at food court! And shopping right on site! Great stores affordable and luxury brands.
30,The property needs a overall freshening. Woodwork and doors were dingy and chipped. Same with fixtures in bathrooms.  Staff was very friendly if you need directions or recommendations. Don‚Äôt touch the mini bar as everything is on a sensor and I turned a bottle just to look at it and tried charging 265.00 for something I did not consume. Hope they will fix this soon.
50,"We (a mature couple) arrived about 10pm mid-week pre-Superbowl for a three night stay. It was on an airline travel agency package deal which got us to Vegas cheaper than paying for flights and hotel separately. At the time I felt that a King premium room in the Forum tower was going to be okay for us. But I became nervous with my choice as bad review after bad review was posted in Dec/Jan. After I checked in on-line pre-flight I was offered some emailed upgrades one no charge others at cost but decided just to wait and see what happened at the desk. I was glad I waited! Without asking Katherine at the front desk upgraded us to a beautiful corner room in the Augustus Tower with strip views. (And we are not in any way high rollers.) We actually found all the staff we interacted with to be friendly and helpful but are especially grateful for Katherine taking care of us like that. My hope would be that if we had been unhappy in our original room designation they would have worked with us on a solution then as well.    We chose not to have housekeeping come in. The room was clean. There were plenty of towels and the bed/bedding were very nice. The coffee maker that was supposed to be in the room was absent but a quick stop at the front desk to inquire on how to have one brought up and it was there before we got back to the room after breakfast. (We did not have to go through the ""Ivy"" app.) The mini-bar rules and being charged for ""moving stuff""was visible and very clear. The wi-fi was fine. Yes only 2 devices but whatever. The pool area was closed and although we knew that it would have been nice to have a place to sit outside on the property. We had zero issues with noise from the guests on our floor. You had to show your room key to get the tower elevators. The resort fee is what it is. And yes it's expensive to eat to drink on-site but there are ways to cut costs if you are willing to do the leg work. For example at Guy Brioche it was $38 for a double coffee yogurt parfait and a wrap. Across the street at CVS the cost for about the same choices was $17.    The property is beautiful well kept up both inside and out. It's pretty noisy what with overhead music and the slots competing for your attention but we found that in most of the casino properties we visited. Smoke smell was sometimes an issue but not as bad as some reported. It took 5 business days for our ""incidental charge"" to be taken from the credit card and it was $200/night instead of the 100/night I was expecting maybe because of the tower we were in? Taxi service and luggage storage was quick and effortless. At peak times the check-in/check out lines were very very long. We were lucky to arrive in a quiet period of the day and used the on-line check-out option when we left."
10,Hadn‚Äôt been here in over 10 years and nothing has changed (literally). Furniture is peeling wallpaper is peeling carpet is stained bed pillow cases inside out HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE (was hung up on when called to complain about not having housekeeping services in 4 days even though requested). There were four of us couples some first timers here and none received housekeeping. We will NEVER be back!
50,Took my son for his 21st birthday - had the best time! Food gaming and entertainment was great! Everyone had an awesome time and already planning out next trip. The rooms were nice and clean and staff was very helpful.
50,Was at the Cesaer‚Äôs Places during super Bowl week end and was not impressed with the little petty things that I felt is taking advantage of the clients such as having only 2 devices on Wifi like seriously what is the difference to this massive Corporation to have unlimited wifi much lower scaled hotels have the unlimited devices to wifi I just don‚Äôt get it.    The other thing is the crazy charge to the room with regards to the Mini bar to which I never used but the minute you left something and because it‚Äôs weighed it automatically triggers a few to the room and if you not playing attention to your invoice you‚Äôll over pay again another thing that they (Cesaer‚Äôs) is taking advantage of and makes millions of dollars off the backs for hard earning people that need a little escape and fun not right with that.
40,The hotel is lovely and the room was great. I did not like that I could only access the wifi for 2 devices. we have 2 phones 2 laptops and 2 readers we couldn't use unless we wanted to pay for wifi. Where we were in the complex we did not get adequate cell service to use our own hotspot . I am not sure what I am paying a $50.+ resort fee since its too cold for the pool.  Be aware of the extra fees you wouldn't incur at a motel anywhere else in the US
50,Katherine at the front desk was amazing! She helped us check in with a great big smile and very professional. What a way to start our staycation. My wife can‚Äôt walk far distances and Katherine made sure our room was close to the elevators. She accommodated our needs and made this stay here an awesome one. This is our first time staying here and she made us want to spend our valuable time here. Kudos to Katherine at the front desk!!!
50,My visit to Caesars Palace was wonderful from beginning to end.    Quick background  Getting to Las Vegas I had horrific airline delays (over 24 hours) an airline which was awful including the trip insurance I purchased. This meant I could lose my reservation and I needed to extend the reservation by another day. This created very difficult travel & hotel changes along with potentially high costs.    Caesars Palace  The concierge / front desk person Joselyn went above and beyond to help me. I am not famous nor am I a high roller. Yet Joselyn treated me just as kindly and resolved each and every hotel reservation issues with minimal cost to me. The room was perfect and peaceful for my trip. The hotel itself enabled me renew my energy and have a great time. The room including the bedding had fantastic areas to sit and relax in the room. The room was just luxurious. The restaurants are top notch - whether it‚Äôs Guy Savoy or Beijing Noodle No 9. I can‚Äôt say enough about all their restaurants. I personally liked some of the new computerized gaming machines. I swear‚Ä¶. I will never stay any place else in Las Vegas. Caesar‚Äôs Palace and their staff has my undying loyalty. Thank you Caesars Palace and thank you Joselyn.
10,Went for a work trip and extended our stay an additional day. Checked into both reservations at the same time. Second day when we get back to room at midnight keys did not work. Asked for additional towels extra pillow and blanket and were told that the hotel was out of them. Items missing in the mini bar when we arrived and we were charged for them after checkout. We were charged for parking twice. No room service. By far the worst experience I have ever had at a Las Vegas Hotel on the stip.
50,Went to Las Vegas for a football game and my sister‚Äôs birthday trip. Went to check in and Tangela was working she upgraded me room to a suite no problem was great nice and accommodating no problems first class. The rest of the trip staff treated me first class. Checked out with Tangela asked ‚Äúhow was the stay‚Äù I said great and had a great time‚Äù would definitely stay here everytime I‚Äôm in Vegas take care of the staff they will treat Vegas style first class.
10,For over an hour and to no avail I used hotel texting; security phone line and guest services phone line to address the noise nuisance in room next to mine at 10:09pm. This same group kept me up from 3:30-4:45am this morning. I called about that too and don‚Äôt think they ever sent security. Terrible customer service!! If they are that short staffed on security they either need to reduce bookings OR hire contract security officers.
50,We were a group of four. We picked this hotel due to its central location. Due to different flights our first two checked in at 14.00. They had no problem checking in and were not asked for an early check in fee. Second group checked in at 21.00. Check in for both groups was a pleasant experience taking less than 15 minutes.  We were given a free upgrade which was nice.  We stayed in the Octavius
30,The hotel room is very good and check in staff was great. I had issues with orders that were takeout. We got a lobster Mac and cheese from the Gordon Ramsey grill and honestly the worst item I have ever had. The lady at check out was looking like she had a bad day also.
50,"Fantastic Experience all around.    We booked a trip to Vegas via British Airways which included 7 nights at Caesars in a Forum tower room. So arrival at the hotel was our first contact with them.    Check in queue was around 10minutes and were greeted by a nice guy but forgot to check his name. Without saying anything he upgraded our room to the Palace tower which was a nice surprise after a long flight. The lobby in itself is fantastic    The room itself was great very large bed plenty of space for clothes had a safe iron hairdryer etc but the bathroom was the winner. A Spa style bath was great separate shower and enclosed toilet and a sink for each of us. If you're a couple i would recommend this room.    Wi-fi was excellent both myself and my wife used our phones. I do believe there is an additional charge for more than 2 devices which would have annoyed me if I needed it but this instance 2 was enough    The room was cleaned daily and sheets/towels changed frequently.    Only hiccup was one the second day I was charged for a ""wellness"" kit from the bar which we didn't use one quick phone call to the front desk to explain the situation who said we wouldn't be charged if the item was still there and would be credited on the bill. Needless to say this was the case and within a couple of days it was corrected.    Staff were friendly throughout.    Food court was expensive as is the theme throughout Vegas but bobby's burgers were the standout winner.    Casino was clean and tidy and drinks were offered fairly frequently.    The show absinthe was fantastic and easily one of my top 2 shows i've seen in Vegas. Was a bit worried given the price of the tickets but the show was worth every penny.    Couple of nitpicks were the temperature in the bathroom was a bit too cold at times compared to the rest of the room and would have liked a couple more plug sockets.    A lot of people on here seem to complain about the resort fees but you know they're coming up front. So just plan for them although part of me would rather than added the fee onto the room price upfront but i've come to terms which trips to America that the ticket price is never the full picture as Taxes and Tips etc are added after.    All in all we would happily come back to Caesars if we want to stay in the heart of the strip."
30,Great room. Clean. Comfy. One negative is that I was charged for mini bar purchases that I didn't make. They claim because I opened the door and put a bottle of water in that it triggered charges. If that is the case then there should be a sign stating not use it.
10,Absolute rip off. Staff very unfriendly and only care about getting as much money from you as possible. $60 to check in. $50 for a pizza. ‚Ç¨10 for a bottle of water. $104 at checkout as ‚Äúresort fee‚Äù for wifi facilities and water‚Ä¶ the pool was closed! I didnt even get to use it! The moron behind the counter had her script though. Then another $36 for two nights parking. If you enjoy having a bath with your uncle this is the place for you
50,Maria S helped us check in. I immediately noticed a booking error (my fault) and Maria assisted us in getting it figured out with just a few phone calls. It‚Äôs not everyday that you encounter such great customer service.
50,Team member Zandra checked me in and was friendly and warm and set the tone for the whole stay. Appreciated her excellent and genuine service! Thank you to her and all staff I interacted with who were always helpful and proactive.
50,We are enjoying our experience at the Las Vegas Caesars. We especially appreciate our check in experience with Zandra. She was cheerful and efficient. She was able to find connecting room during our early check in. Thank you Zandra we putting in the extra effort for us!!
40,Caesar's Palace Las Vegas has likely the worst guest signage of any hotel I've ever stayed at in Las Vegas. There are no signs that show you where the gym or spa is when you're in the casino area or exiting the many elevators from a guest room there are no signs when you exit the elevators to tell you where to go to dine. I had to go to security to ask for the names and locations of places that I was to meet other guests or members of my party. Even the security officer laughed and said it's really difficult to find anything for anyone even for those that work in the hotel. And that's coming from an employee in security! Please properly mark where the signs to restaurants locations are facilities and other areas of interest throughout the entire hotel. Some of the signs don't even point in the correct direction that fo exist or I should state that very poorly exist. It's a large facility with lots of unique shops restaurants dining areas the Forum Shops pool and spa facilities and convention rooms. Finding those areas is very challenging. Even locating the correct tower elevator is difficult.
50,Great location with awesome views of the Vegas Strip! Hotel is awesome and sister property Paris is wonderful. We will be back again! Shows are fantastic and Ruth Chris dinner was delicious with excellent service. Weather was in mid 60‚Äôs -nice to get a break from the Midwest cold!
50,My wife and I were staying here for a while when traveling through south west. Our exciting experience started at the registration desk straight away! Moses P. was helping us in a very professional friendly and positive manner! Moses answered all my questions so the process was really quick and smooth. We loved the place and definitely when coming to Vegas again will stay at Caesars! A lot of attractions inside and great casino of course. Thank you so much Moses and Caesars team!
50,We were group of 5 friends who booked 5 seperate rooms. Some of us booked through Expedia some of us book through apple travel some of us book directly with Ceasar Palace. I tried to call the booking management department and spoke with Billy he could not help us out to tie our reservations together so we could be assigned on the same floor. But when we check-in Gemma went a thousand extra miles to help us out with room assigning. She explained everything and make the whole process thoroughly easy! We were considering to change hotel if it didnt work out. But Gemma saved the world so we could stay at Ceasars and enjoyed Vegas!  Thank you souch Gemma!
50,the lady Tangela that checked us in was so friendly and nice and made sure we had everything we needed. She was awesome! the restaurants the Homestade and alfalfa had such great and friendly service and excellent food..
50,We usually stay at Caesars Palace when in Las Vegas and it was fantastic.  Zandra front desk was friendly and helpful checking us in for two rooms. We upgraded ours and it was worth it.  Joy at Pronto by Giada was always friendly and made a good Americano. She always said hello when I went for coffee.  Food was great at Mr. Chow and at Old Homestead.
10,I brought my daughter with me to have some fun in Vegas and I thought that Caesar‚Äôs Palace would be fabulous for her trip. I brought my other daughter there about 5 years ago and had a great time. Last week however the experience was terrible and I‚Äôll never stay there again. We arrived very early in the morning and I was aware that check in would be later on in the day. However I was hopeful that a room might be available or at the very least we could leave our luggage there while we shopped. I approached the desk and a very salty guy who never even made eye contact with me started in on a rant with no punctuation at all and he was hard to hear over the blaring music. So as I tried to catch every 3rd or 4th word and figure out what he was saying I ask him if we could leave luggage. He then looked at me and said ‚Äúthat was the first thing I said to you.‚Äù He said don‚Äôt come back until around 4:00 and maybe a room will be ready. I couldn‚Äôt believe this guy. We walked away and found the bell hop who was very gracious and took our bags. Later on (around noon)we walk past registration and tons of people are checking in so we get in line and hope we get a room. We did and the lady was great. So the first guy was just an ass. So we start heading to our room in the forum tower and I‚Äôm shocked at the condition of the elevators hallways and our room. Wall paper was literally peeling off the walls tiles missing from the ceiling in the elevator broken glass panels in the elevators. One guy even told us that he was stuck in a forum elevator for 5 minutes the day before. We‚Äôll never stay there again I was shocked and appalled
50,We had a great check in experience. Katherine was great! We got in late from our flight and she was just the right amount of positive energy! Great suggestions from her too ! We have had the best stay. Thank you to all the staff we encountered. Such a beautiful resort.
50,Very nice hotel üëç will stay again with my family on vacation. Very happy with everything this hotel is to die for . Love everything about this place . The food is expensive can be a little cheaper for family‚Äôs .
40,Comfortable and quiet but everything - from accommodation to drinks and food in the restaurants - is just massively overpriced. It would be at least nice to offer guest free coffee and tea in the room but there were simply no little perks. Lots of gouging. Poor value for money.
40,I've been staying at CPLV for 20 years when I go to Vegas. Aside from the insanely high prices for food etc. that is endemic/common of ALL premium LV properties these days CPLV is a great property.    One item that has disappointed me now on the last few trips was the conditions of the Qua Spa. As with all properties they keep cutting back amenities. Years ago there was fruit various juices snacks etc. Now you can get iced tea and water. A great example of them cutting back is the Pretzel snacks used to be the Rold Gold packages. Now they are unbranded bags (half the size) that look like they purchased by the 1000s from Costco or Food For Less.    More striking is the degradation of the Spa facilities. The first day the steam room was working but when the steam turned on it sounded like a jet plane was landing in there. Low and behold the next day it was closed along with the Artic room. In past years the showers had multiple water head settings (front showerhead jets back showerhead jets and the large overhead showerhead. You had the ability to select multiple shower hears etc. They now are all broken or fixed to one setting. The water temp is inconsistent and now difficult to regulate. In fact on my last trip three of the eight showers were Out Of Order. Tragic how such a great spa has gone to the dogs. Oh and by the way the price for a day pass has gone up from $15.00 to $50.00 or $60.00 bucks now. The massage and facial prices have gone up significantly so its not like they cant afford to fix the place up a bit. Smells like the bean counters have really taken over. Sad how such a great spa has gone to crap.
40,Booked Augustus tower for our silver anniversary and was upgraded to a corner suite over looking the strip. The room is comfortable with all the amenities like slippers robes and high end toiletries. The selections and hours of restaurants have cut back this past year. No more Seven Star/Diamond lounge. Pools is not open and the spa and gym is short staffed and dated.
50,"To be honest I went to Caesars to see Adele at the Colosseum I stayed at the Luxor (and having visited wish I'd stayed at Caesars). - lets get to that staff more friendly and helpful public areas brighter and nicer    If you are able to get tickets for Adele I'd urge you to buy them. Over the past five years (with the 18 month Covid hiatus within that period) I have been to many concerts (inc Fleetwood Mac Gary Barlow Adam Lambert and Queen Rod Stewart Diana Ross Elton John) but this show tops my list.    Adele self confessed drama queen (and in my opinion girl next door) never missed a note (neither solo or backed by her full band) some of the effects were spectacular and can see exactly why she'd have had to postpone the beginning of the residency citing ""it 'aint ready"" in early 2022.  Caesars have given her the tools and the venue for Adele and company to give a show to be proud of and even though (without the cost of the 8 days holiday around the concert) I will remember this show for the rest of my life.    A passenger on the flight from the UK asked why we didn't go to see Adele when she appeared in the UK my answer was I'd have had to share her with 80000 others and seen her as an ""ant"" on a stage because the venues were so big it was worth paying four times more to see her in an intimate venue and sharing her with 4500 others!"
50,Check in with Yennifer was smooth fun and she made us feel extremely welcome.  Yennifer helped us with our upgrade and set us up in a great room with views of the pool and Las Vegas. Would recommend her to anyone..
50,The casino and shows are super nice! I love the shopping area the strip and surroundings. The hotel room has many hidden fees and you spend too much than they don‚Äôt advise. Room looking is just fine. The view we had was great the only problem is that the room don‚Äôt look towards the strip but to the other rooms so the view could be better. The elevators look a lite old and need a renew
20,I listened to a report on how bad caesar‚Äôs Palace Internet was. I thought they could‚Äôve corrected it by the time they saw that but now it‚Äôs beyond awful that you could go to other hotels and get better Internet I want on their TV to try to look up our bill. Nothing then I went on my phone tried calling an outside person that didn‚Äôt understand me pure chaos so I go to the lobby and ask that young man to print out an itemized bill five times did not seem to have a flow I worked in the hotel industry where did simple turn into complicated all these apps all these other things take time I left their negative
50,Came with our adult daughter so she and a friend could see Adel. CJ went out of his way to make sure both our rooms were on the same floor and with great views of the Bellagio fountains. Thank you CJ.
10,$75 to use the fridge in your room for personal items. $21 to use the Keurig in the room. Over salted food at exorbitant upcharges. The shower could only muster up the water pressure of an 80 year old man with an inflamed prostate. Thank you for the example of staggering gluttony and lucre however you should reapply the gold leaf the rot is beginning to show. Particularly around the door handles in the restaurant bathrooms.
50,Zandra made my stay amazing! She was very thoughtful and helpful with all my questions I had. This was my first time staying at Cesar‚Äôs and she definitely will have me coming back! Thank you Zandra!! <3
50,Zandra is the best in the game! Made our trip that much better. She was so helpful and accommodating. The hotel is beautiful and I would give Zandra 100 stars if I could. Make sure to say hi to Zandra if you stay here!
50,Zandra made sure to get us all set up as smoothly and quickly as possible upon check in. She was so helpful and we are so thankful! Seriously we need more people who are prepared to help out the way she did!
50,We loved our weekend in Vegas at Caesar‚Äôs palace! Gorgeous rooms and views. Emma at the front desk was amazing at getting our big group booked in quickly! All the food we got from there was amazing but Carmines was our favorite.
20,"Visited Vegas for the Weekends with Adele Residency. Several friends had highly recommended this hotel due to its location and amenities and we also decided to stay there out of convenience with regards to the show. Unfortunately the rooms and service did not live up to the hype and did not warrant the exorbitant 5-star prices. Let‚Äôs start with some of the good.    Pro's: The hotel is located right on the strip walking distance to most of the city's most popular attractions. The hotel itself is an attraction as the casinos restaurants and roman themed forum areas are worth the visit. Next time I would just visit and not stay there.    Cons: Check-in lines are perpetually long and are reminiscent of the lines you find at Disney parks (this applies to restaurants and most attractions at the hotel). It took us about an hour to get checked-in and this was after a late evening flight. The automatic check-in kiosks didn't work and there wasn't enough staff to deal with the crowds. The gentleman who checked us in wasn't very pleasant or helpful.    If you are traveling with someone who isn't so mobile or is averse to walking don't expect your room to be close to the check-in counter as you must walk a considerable distance to get to some areas of the hotel.    I didn't mind the walking but rolling your suitcase halfway across the hotel on mostly carpet floors is not a fun task. There also isn't anyone to help you with your luggage as is customary in most high-end hotels (I'm guessing this is normal in most of the mega casino properties on the strip).    The rooms were the greatest disappointment of all. While our room was spacious and comfortable enough some of the furnishings and fixtures were either old faded chipping or all the above. The vents in the bathroom and other areas of the room had a lot of dust on them. But perhaps the very worst aspect of the room was what we found when we first arrived.    When we finally made it to our room one of the bathroom sinks was full of a disgusting mixture of water and lots hair. This made us doubt the cleanliness of our room and we called to have the sink cleaned.    Unfortunately there isn't a direct line to the front desk of the actual property we were routed to a call center that seemed to be abroad which would put in a ticket. We waited over an hour for the cleaning people to respond and I even had to go downstairs and wait the long check-in line again just to try get someone upstairs.    The sink problem was eventually temporarily resolved 2 hours later but this was after many attempts to get in touch with the staff. The next day the same mixture of hair and water bubbled up again (and neither of us had used that sink). We called several times and the problem persisted and the wait time to get it fixed was just always excessive. We had asked to switch rooms and they did not give us that option since the hotel was ""full"". We eventually resigned ourselves to the overpriced room with the dirty hairy sink.    In conclusion if you decide to stay at Caesar's Palace expect to pay premium 5-star prices for subpar service and dilapidated rooms. Will avoid staying at this property again."
20,The experience was very disappointing The Forum towers are very dilapidated and worn out Elevators missing buttons and had a glitch furniture damage. The only good thing was the bed but the rest of the room felt old and in bad shape.
10,Caesars was extremely unprofessional with our suite and connectors. Our key access was removed unannounced in the middle of the night and management and security forced us out of our rooms unwarranted.
50,Large party of family came for a 21st birthday. Everything went GREAT! We needed 3 rollaways for 3 separate suites and they took care of it without blinking an eye! Shayan Maher was very very helpful. She wanted to meet the birthday girl congratulated her on the birthday and having so many people make the trip!
50,I stay at Caesars Palace every year. Emma at the front desk is amazing! Anything we need she is more than happy to help. The rooms/casino are always clean. Good food and fun gambling! There are plenty of slots. Great poker room and awesome sports book. Its always a good time if you stay for 3 day or a week!
50,Tangela is an absolute gem! I recently had the pleasure of staying at Caesars and I was blown away by her exceptional customer service. Despite arriving at the hotel late at night Tangela went above and beyond to coordinate a room for me and make sure I was comfortable and settled in for the night. Her kindness attention to detail and willingness to help truly made my experience at the hotel a memorable one. Thank you Tangela for your outstanding service!
40,Great location. Best Caesar‚Äôs Reward 7 Star checkin experience. Only one breakfast restaurant (Cafe Americana) and it isn‚Äôt part of the rewards program. 2 for 1 so an $80 breakfast costs you $160 Reward dollars. The bars are not friendly difficult to meet people and talk to your friends. Servers are sterile and cold.    Sophia at 7 Star checkin found an error in my limo reservations and made the correction She moved our assigned room closer to the elevator. Very patient and friendly.    Paul S. was super polite and friendly in the host office. He made us feel appreciated and answered questions for us.
50,Had a great stay & Delano at the front desk was a pleasure he got us a great room that we could get into instantly which is exactly what we needed. He was really pleasant and really made it a great start to our trip after we had experienced flight and room cancellations at in other hotel.    The room was great although a little disapointed coffee or tea is an additional cost in the room. For the price we paid I would have expected it.    Overall great trip & very friendly staff.
50,Darlene at the VIP Diamond check in was amazing. Her customer service was top notch. We had several questions and she was very knowledgeable and so kind. She even promised a follow through and that is going above and beyond!! Thank you for making our day and our stay extra special Darlene!!
50,I always enjoy my visit at Caesars. Sofia at Diamond Check-in was wonderful! The new casino renovations look great. the new lobby bar is a nice addition especially to be able to watch sports and play video poker.
50,Emma helped make our stay perfect. She answered all of our questions made sure we were taken care of and was so sweet and kind. We can‚Äôt wait to come back and visit again such a great time making memories with family & friends.
50,I rarely write reviews but when I do it was either an atrocious experience or an extraordinary experience. In this case I will say it was an extraordinary one and it was all thanks to Emma's hospitality. I highly recommend if staying at Caesars to go see Emma at check in. She treats you more then just another guest she goes out of her way and you're treated more like family than strangers.
50,The property is enormous and with that in mind the cleanliness of the entire property was Amazing from the casinos to the room and the exterior. The staff was also exceptional and the interactions we had could not have been more pleasant. Overall it was a great experience!
50,Once again another great trip to Las Vegas Ceasars Palace. From the time we pulled up to the VIP Valet parking until we left for the airport it was like visiting family. We are always greeted as if we are Royalty The Staff seem to remember us and always go out of their way to make us us feel as if we were at home. This experience would not be the same if it was not for Emma Martin at the front desk. She goes beyond her role at Caesar making sure we have everything we need from fabulous rooms that are always ready and any local information that may apply to our visit. We travel to vegas several times a year and we could stay anywhere in Vegas but Emma's hospitality keeps us coming back. Thanks Emma and all of the great staff of Caesars.!!!!
30,Stayed there since my convention was held at their convention center. Very crowded place. Standard rooms nothing especial. You can smell their cassino everywhere. Restaurants options were fair. Breakfast options were poor. Uneventful check-in/out. No help with luggage etc. Decent wi-fi.
50,Emma who works the reservation desk is absolutely fabulous! She‚Äôs kind and patient while checking in our very large group. She is the nicest person and always has a smile for you no matter how busy she is. She‚Äôs so accommodating and at the ready if a problem should arise. She treats our group with respect kindness and humor. She‚Äôs just the best employee anyone could possibly have.
50,If you go to Caesars ask for Emma at check in. She is amazing helpful kind and caring. We had a large group and she took care of us amazingly well . Making sure we were all happy . She even made sure we all knew where our tower was. Amazing
50,Emma books us in each of my 7 stays here    She goes out of her way to make sure we (I) have a 1st class experience    Glitches occur- in this & last visit a room key or two did not function    Emma always makes things right    A good start in registration set tone for a great time Thank you
50,Love Love Love Emma at the front desk! Top notch customer service. Check-in and check-out is a breeze with her. She always makes sure we have everything we need to make our trips to Caesars and Las Vegas amazing! 5 stars to Emma!!
50,Katrina although new in tenure handled our check in like a season veteran in the hospitality industry. She definitely has a place in this city and i can't wait until my next visit. I went to redeem my annual free nights and she upgraded us to a suite that was not only spacious but located in one of my favorite towers; the Augustus. Her colleague Moses did more than part the seas for us in this regard helping us get a very generous rate. She's also a foodie like my partner and I and had some 5 star recommendations for us to try apart from the buffet we were already set on. I can't recommend Caesars enough and she made our stay most memorable
50,The person who helped us at the front desk  Emma is absolutely one of the best people I have ever worked with. She was incredibly helpful kind and professional. I can‚Äôt wait to come back and work with her again!!!
50,7 Star check in was great thanks to Darlene and Daniel who made check in seamless!!! Darlene and Daniel helped me get the room I was looking for to make this trip memorable.  Fabian at Giada Wine Bar makes a great Ballissimo!
50,If you book a room at Caesars see Emma at the check in desk!! On top of getting one of the best and cleanest rooms on the strip Emma will do whatever it takes to make your stay the best it can be!!! Just amazing!!!
50,Emma is the greatest employee at the front desk. She always goes above and beyond her call of duty. She wants and makes sure that each and every guest leaves having had the best experience possible. She creates return guests with her attention to detail and always putting the guests first. This is the only hotel we stay at in Las Vegas.
40,Myself and my wife had our first visit to Las Vegas recently and one of our definate goals was to go to Caesars.  We were staying 10 minutes up the strip and Caesars was really easy to walk over to and from the outside it looks amazing. The buildings are huge and look very authentic with gardens and water features around the site.  Inside everything is very plush and you can't comprehend the size of everything. In addition to the hotel you have really large varied shopping malls and a wide variety of places to eat and drink for all tastes.  We went over to the casino areas and the range of games & machines was enourmous - the biggest worry we had was getting lost. We fulfilled our goal but playing some slots and roulette for a short while.  Slightly disappointed that they no longer have coin operated machines but the carrying out gambling in Vegas ticked the box for us.  I would definately recommend a visit to Caesars to take in the view atmosphere and just to say you've been.
50,Very friendly staff. Spacious room was very clean and had all the amenities one needed. Room was ready on time. Atmosphere of Hotel and Restuarants was welcoming. Had a lot of room to move around on all the Casio floor.
50,Has been one of the most helpful concierge‚Äôs we have ever had. She does a great job. Hotel is beautiful clean and centrally located on the strip. Staff is all friendly and helpful. Thanks Emma for making this a great trip.
50,Emma at check in goes way beyond your expectations to make your stays so inviting and comforting than any other place I‚Äôve stayed in Las Vegas! Wouldn‚Äôt stay anywhere else. It‚Äôs always been a pleasure to see how she makes you feel comfortable in your visit.
50,Stayed here with a large group - Emma the concierge was great - FAST check in and super friendly service! Hotel is super clean and a great central strip location. Caesars has some of everything beautiful hotel. Thank you Emma!
50,Our amazing stay began at the front desk. We met Katherine H. at the check in desk and was pleasantly surprised by her top notch customer service. We both had a long day and her friendly attitude and eagerness to make our trip the most enjoyable was refreshing to say the least. She upgraded our room to the Augustus tower which was nothing short of a delightful room. I would 100% stay at Caesars Palace again. She deserves a promotion from management. The amazing customer service didn‚Äôt end with her though just about everyone we encountered was helpful and polite.
40,Stayed here in late October.    Pros:  1) Pools were open and I could get some sun unlike the Wynn.  2) A lot of food options in the Casino and nearby and not a bad place to be on the Strip.  3) They have early and late check in for a somewhat modest fee.    Nuetral: Rooms were a bit dated.    Negatives: Cafe Americano and Beijing Noodle #9 restaurants are below average.
50,Claire M. helped us after we stayed for the week and our flight was cancelled so we needed to come back for a room for one night. She was helpful accommodating and very friendly and made our experience as good as it possibly could have been.
50,Linda Wang checked us in. She was fun and friendly! We enjoyed our stay! Recommended the almond croissant at the bakery and it was by far the best almond croissant I‚Äôve ever had. Even bought one for Linda since she was so welcoming on our getaway!
50,This was my first trip to Vegas! Although our flight was delayed and we missed the Chiefs game check-in at Caesars was very easy and pretty quick. The front desk associate offered us a few different upgrades and we decided to upgrade to a suite with Strip View. The room was clean and spacious. I loved the sitting area with couch and pillows. My only complaint was the sheets were a bit rough. This is the only hotel I noticed such paper like sheets and the blanket was very thin and we did not have any extra pillows or blankets in the room closet. However we did not need extras so it worked out fine.  The resort is HUGE and very pretty to walk though and explore. Overall a good experience!
50,Just coming to the end of a 4 night stay at this iconic hotel. We stayed in the Palace tower which i would recommend as it is further away from the main casino area and slightly quieter.  This venue gets very busy so if you wish to eat in the restaurants within the hotel factor that into your thinking. We have visited most hotels on the strip during our stay and would still recommend this in the top 3.
40,Spent 5 days here before Caribbean cruise and was an experience to say the least! Ignore the bad reviews as it‚Äôs fine as a hotel even given a free upgrade to a huge suite with whirlpool bath! No issues or problems either with deposit or room tax ( which we had to pay)  didn‚Äôt use or open mini bar as ludicrously expensive bottles of water around 10 dollars coffee 7.50 dollars so take plenty of money ! There‚Äôs some lovely places to eat at the hotel  went to Gordon Ramseys  fish restaurant and the buffet ( most expensive but best buffet ever! ) also the Vanderpump cocktail place cocktails around 20 dollars each but fabulous .Had a dabble and husband won about a thousand dollars in total on a budget of 100 dollars a day for casino  could get out of hand  but 400 lasted and we were left with about 700 so not bad ! Beware that the casino is very busy and smoky even to walk through  both ended up with scratchy throats ! It‚Äôs off the bucket list now and doubt we will go back but what an experience!
50,Stayed here the first weekend in January as part of a multi-city trip; this was our last stop before heading home. We arrived before the official check in and we‚Äôre allowed to check into our suite early (which was great as we needed a nap after an early morning flight!)    The hotel is as fancy as you would expect upon entry and our suite was equally so - we were in the newer tower in a north facing room and has an amazing view of the strip. The room and bathroom were both huge and had so much space that we didn‚Äôt make use of. The rooms were cleaned daily by housekeeping with fresh towels and replenished toiletries etc.    The hotel is in a great central location on the strip so that you can walk to various other hotels restaurants and bars. All staff that we interacted with during our stay were friendly and helpful too.    We also booked into the Qua Spa on our last day after check in - which I‚Äôve written a separate review about - but it is definitely worth a visit!
50,Taja Nunez at the check in helped us out immensely on our quick trip with a personal problem. After wandering around at multiple stations we still couldn‚Äôt get the appropriate necessities. Taja overheard and went out of her way to get us the care we needed period. Thank you Taja!
20,The stay was mediocre. When we were checking in online it said we got a room upgrade free of charge for premium however when we got there the front desk said they had no record of that. We let it go then our room had flickering lights and the outlets in the bathroom did not work. Also our hotel cards were frequently demagnetized which was annoying because we had to walk all the way to the front desk to get it fixed. Honestly it‚Äôs pretty disappointing for being a 4 star hotel. I don‚Äôt know if we will be staying there again.
10,There was blood found on the comforter and when we told the front desk they said ‚Äú we are all out of fresh comforters‚Äù and sent up several sheets to replace the bloody comforter. They didn‚Äôt even take the disgusting comforter with them. Just dropped the sheets off!!!!
30,"I was there for a business conference. We probably booked approximately 800 rooms for the entire week. Check in felt like I was being scammed. I wanted an early check in because I arrived at about 8:30 a.m. I tried three times. First time I was quoted $60 for early check in but no guarantee a room would become available early. So why would I waste the $$? Second time I was quoted $80 upgrade for only Executive Suites because ""nothing else was available and this is my only option"". Nope. Third time about an hour later I paid $30 extra for a room that I could get into immediately at noon. They must make a killing off these fees since regular check in isn't until 4:00 p.m.    After calling customer service turns out that the front desk folks do get an incentive fee for upgrading guests that's why I was told only executive suite was available.    Just reviewed my final invoice and see that I was charged $39 for a Wellness Kit that I picked up to look at. You are automatically charged for anything you lift up off the tray of mini bar items. It does not matter if you put it back down unconsumed. It is based on weight. Nobody takes an inventory or replenishes items during your stay.    There are a lot of hotels in Vegas. I'm sure they all have their own hooks but I would not stay at this one again."
10,Visited Las Vegas and stayed at Caesar‚Äôs Palace. Stayed 4 nights 5 days.    Very disappointed.    Beautiful entrance to and in the hotel lobby but when you get to the room that is another story. The rooms are old dirty and dated. Disgusting. I expected much more for the price of a hotel night stay.    Employees are very nice and all are very helpful.    Extremely expensive. All of the Celebrities have a restaurant and think they can charge whatever they want. Ridiculous.    I have been going to Vegas since the 1980‚Äôs and this is NOT the Vegas I remember.    Save your money and stay somewhere else where you will get what you pay for. Bellagio and Venetian are great option versus Caesar‚Äôs Palace.
30,Stayed 3 nights at Caesars for a conference. Older but classic hotel. Huge hotel. Love their atmosphere ambiance and decor. Hotel is very elegant.    Ideal location. Smacked down in the middle of the strip. Convenient to other hotels restaurants and shopping. 5 stars for location.    Caesars offers excellent dining and shopping. Tons of restaurants and shops. Plenty to choose from. Their bars/lounges are nice. Fun to people watch. Employees are cool. Nice people. Friendly and hospitable. Love The Forum Shops. Ate at Beijing Noodle 9. Excellent! Also ate at Sushi Roku. Outstanding.    I stayed in the Augustus tower. Had a view of the Bellagio. Nice view. Older room but very spacious. Handicap room but that's okay. Outdated amenities carpet wallpaper etc. I noticed poop and vomit stains on the outside of the toilet bowl. Gross. Didn't take a pic because that's nasty. Just don't look down. Bed was really comfortable. Shower was huge. Mini bar is really expensive. Rip off. Room has a Keurig but you have to purchase their coffee pack for $20. Comes with 4 k cups. No thanks.    Overall decent experience. I'd stay here again if I got comped or if room rates were less than $150 per night.
50,Darlene at check in was very accommodating and friendly! Very smooth and nice. Got us all rooms by each other. She was super great and highly recommend. Can‚Äôt wait to bring friends back here! üñ§üñ§üñ§üñ§
20,"The Good -  1) Generally the staff are super nice. Housekeeper was nice (I did not say effective) and the front desk staff and maintenance people were all very polite. I am always impressed with and appreciative of the service oriented workers in Las Vegas. I love that!  2) Caesars is a huge operation (and includes other hotels and facilities as well). I am impressed simply by the fact that they keep the wheels turning.  3) Beds are seriously super comfy (Can be bought from Simmons Beautyrest in case you want your own. $1750. The beds have always been my favorite and I sleep like a log!  4)Security at the elevator tower for my section of the hotel (not sure about others).  5)The ""Ivy"" assistant although a bit tedious got the job done when requested  6) The bellmen and staff out front are great about getting people into cabs and on their way.    The Bad -  1) Why have ""kiosk"" check in if the kiosks go off line at 9:00. I arrived at 10:30 as planned.  2) My room in Octavius tower was just ""sort of clean"" - lots of debris in corners which means they aren't really cleaning anything. Bathroom floor was very dirty. Ewww.  3) It is 2023...there was nowhere to plug any electricals near bed...Red Roof Inns even have USB chargers on the bedside.  4) Several broken lamps and inoperable electrical outlets (maintenance came and fixed or removed them).  5) Dingy furniture that needs to go.  6) No coffee maker no hair dryer. Finally got both by the end of the day but the hair dryer had so little power so as to render it almost useless. Do yourself a favor and go to CVS or Walgreens and buy a box of pods for the coffee maker. Caesers will charge you $15 if you open the box of coffee pods. I waited for an hour for the hair dryer...finally gave up. Was was late for my first meeting  7) I discovered after a day and a half there that the door between my room and the adjoining room was unlocked. Not a comfortable feeling for a single woman.  8) No room service after about 10:00 pm. RUKidding me! I got in late and was hungry. Just wanted a burger or salad. Nothing. Nada. I was too tired to go out and had to be up at 6 am the next morning. This is Las Vegas for god's sake. I ended up paying $12 to eat a bag of nuts from the minibar.  9) This is a biggie: I was there for business meetings and breakfast and lunch was served to those who signed up and paid for it. On day 2 the chicken marsala at the buffet was raw. Not just a little raw but completely cold and clear pink flesh with just a thin white cooked edge. The breakfast was the most pathetic powdered scrambled eggs ever. The privilege of eating and taking breaks there cost us $400 each.  10) Several random mini-bar and late checkout charges on my bill. Check your bill. They did correct it though. Apparently if you even lift up an item from the mini bar you automatically get charged.  11) Lines to grab a cup of coffee or snack where ridiculous. They always have been. I have been going to this same event for years and it does not get any better. Have they learned nothing about hosting large meetings? Do better Caesars!  12) Everything seems to be so much work to get to...whether you are just trying to get out to the street to walk somewhere (Walgreens to buy the coffee pods or shampoo since housekeeping did not leave me any) or walking to meetings or getting a ""quick"" snack...The place just gives me a headache.    The Ugly - Walking to meetings you have to go through the gambling area where you are often treated to cringeworthy people who have spent all night drinking and gambling. This time however several groups were there for meetings and events (which is normal). They were all professional and well dressed. The crowds on this trip were so much better than in past. I am there 2-3 times a year. I imagine that you have fewer ""what happens in vegas stays in vegas"" types in January. So while I normally feels the need to take a shower after sharing an elevator with some of the other guests this time I did not. Yay!"
50,Caesars palace is well situated on the strip and easy to get around town. Service was good  restaurants clean and friendly . The tram service was useful next door to Caesars if you are going to Golden Knights game or shopping .
50,5 Stars for Caesars on this trip. The Room and the Staff were 5 stars all the way. From the time we checked into the hotel Keli was exceptional at the check in desk in the Diamond Rewards check in. The room was perfect and very clean and had everything we could ever need. All of the employees were exceptional. Thanks Caesars for a wonderful trip.
50,In a time when you don‚Äôt get a lot of personal customer service attention these days Caesar‚Äôs still gets it right! VIP check-in was a great place to start and end the visit. All the staff were attentive welcoming pleasant offering assistance and ready to answer questions. This was my first stay at this hotel and Yuni took the time to find us just the room we were looking for. We stayed at the Augustus tower mid-level with a beautiful view of the fountain and the strip. The room had nice updated furnishings and the bed was very comfortable. Unfortunately it wasn‚Äôt spotless but still clean and tidy for the most part (found a dirty washcloth behind the door of the bathroom). The shower and tub had great pressure and having the option was great!    Slots were also decent‚Ä¶ lots of options cleaning staff was on top of it and lots of room between machines.    Food at the 24hr place was ok‚Ä¶ I would personally prefer more 3am breakfast options. The quick burger from the food court was delicious and I recommend the buttermilk onion rings - yum! I also loved having Starbucks just across the hall from our tower elevators‚Ä¶ which made coffee tea and scones/bagels an easy quick pick-up in the afternoon/morning.    I also learned a good lesson this trip‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt move things you don‚Äôt intend to use on the minibar! I had a slight issues with charges for items we didn‚Äôt consume (my fault for moving them)‚Ä¶ but Keli did an outstanding job of making me feel better taking care of my checkout and helping me to resolve the issue.    Thank you Keli and Yuni‚Ä¶ Can‚Äôt wait to see you all agin at Caesars Palace!
50,Caesars Palace never disappoints my wife and myself.  Upon arrival i was pleasantly pleased the way Keli at the Diamond Registration took care of us it was great to have a smiling face greet us after the long flight from Honolulu.  I was really surprised when Keli remembered our last name as we approached her.  The housekeepers were very efficient and professional.  My casino host also took really good care of us ( don‚Äôt know if i can mention his name but management knows who he is.)  I‚Äôve been coming here the past 12 years and i have always given great service.
20,We came here 20 years ago and loved it.  The best thing about the hotel is its central location on the strip.  The lady at reception at check in was disinterested and unhappy with life. Not the best welcome for our exciting holiday.  We stayed for 6 nights with family. Most of the time only 1 of the 6 lifts were working which meant queuing. On another day we had no hot water in our room from first thing in the morning until midday so ended up having to use our son‚Äôs room on another floor. No apology given.  We wanted to use the iron in our room but it had a burnt plate so was totally useless. The cleaner really should have checked this  We checked out online and was angry to see that my son‚Äôs room had been charged for the mini bar. The mini bar had not been used by any of us as we had been warned by reception when we checked in that even opening the door of the bar could generate a charge so we were very cautious. To be fair once I had sent an email to query the charge it was refunded.  My son‚Äôs room stank of marijuana all of the time which we think was coming from another room or rooms via the air vent. I was annoyed when the cleaner said to my son and his fianc√©e ‚Äò this room stinks of cannabis‚Äô. How rude and insulting. She should get her facts right.  The hotel area beside the restaurants and casinos smelled of cigarette smoke all of the time which I found overpowering.  Sorry we will not be returning as the hotel could do with a complete update/renovation.
20,Just stayed in Jan 2023 and be ready for someone reaching into your pocket at every turn. Forget the $28.00 cheeseburgers you should expect that from most hotels today. The Resort fee is clearly posted and one of Caesar's favorite games to play. $52.00 gets you access to the elevators and WiFi but does NOT include parking which is another $18.00/night.    We checked in at 2:45 pm and after a long line 22 mins a nice person got us all set but then asked us for $30.00 for early check-in?? He said the room was ready and I could come back at 4 pm and get the key for NO CHARGE...so we waited walked around and came back. When we returned the line was twice as long and we were told that everyone is in line to pick up their keys...what a joke.    Elevators were ugly and broken sign frames cracked tile. The room was fine limited plugs and not one USB port so bring that with you.    My last time here been to Vegas on and off for forty years but never this place again. I don't mind a place that nickles and dimes you but Caesars 5 and 10 dollars you to death.    Just no fun    Tom
50,In our regular visits to Caesars Palace Las Vegas we check in at the Diamond Registration. After a lengthy drive our spirit gets picked up when we see the smiling faces of: Keli Hiraizumi Rae Soguilon and Daniel Minarsky Their courteous and professional demeanor is an asset to Caesars Palace. While waiting in line we have noticed their exceptional work ethic while dealing with a variety of circumstances. Our trips are made even better because of their presence.
50,Really like this place. So big and amazing. Love the architecture! Ate at Trevi and the have the best Chicken Carbonara pasta I‚Äôve ever had in my life. Also ate at Gordon‚Äôs Pub the nachos are to die for and being topped with the sweet pepper rings was the cherry on top. Pub burger was also amazing!
50,Delano helped me out in a very weird scenario wherein transactions were applied for one day ( rather than my entire stay). He immediately understood my need and helped resolved my issue. He explained me in detail what he is going to and completed it nicely. Really want to give a BIG THANKS to Delano. Great to have such helping and knowledgeable resources.
20,Looks beautiful but all superficial. Our room tub and shower full of mold. Hose for shower leaking all over did call and fixed.  The smell of marijuana all over the grounds and inside was so challenging to deal with.  Overall Vegas is nice and great shows but Cesar‚Äôs palace for the cost lacked maintenance.  For 500 per night w a 50 dollar resort fee per night no coffee pods and when asked for additional  Blankets were told didn‚Äôt have any?
20,The over all experience is on par with the cost of an all inclusive resort but the experience is lacking in comparison. The sheer volume of ways they will price gouge you is insane. 20 dollars for coffee in your room. 75 dollars for a mini fridge you can use room service at 50 dollars for just waffles.    The place is a maze check in was a horrible process if you drive in the staff are incredibly over whelmed and barely capable of helping you navigate it all.    Don't stay on the strip especially not here. Fly in take taxis see the things you can only see here and get out.
20,I have not stayed at Caesars in over 20yrs and will not be back. The Casino itself was nice but nothing that makes or made it stand out from others. The food is expensive like all the other casino's on the strip but unlike the others the food is just average. Our group rented a total of 3 rooms and stayed for 4 nights. All the rooms had some form of wear and tear or straight up damage. My particular room had a broken toilet seat and handle. If taking a hot shower is a must do not stay at Caesar's all rooms on all different floors had inconsistent water temperature to the point sometimes you are taking an ice cold shower. If you don't like 1-ply sand paper as your toilet paper advise you to bring your own as Caesar's has decided you deserve the cheapest they can buy.. They have a mini snack bar charging you 5-star pricing but your staying in a 2-star room. The fridge you cannot use for personal use. Simply put you will not be spending the night in a Palace more like the outhouse. There are way better places to stay in Las Vegas almost can just pick any. Personally for our group back to Mandalay Bay or The Bellagio no more Caesars.
20,They would not add my stay and spa visit to my rewards program for points. Casino and dining are great. Room very spacious comfy and modern - but they did not have the coffee service refilled prior to check in and I had to call daily to get it replenished
10,They tried to charge me for mini-bar and I never used the mini-bar. I think the night I was there the devil escaped from Hell's Kitchen. Don't eat there. They remodeled and it does not look that great. The casino is crawling with hookers from hell. Stay away from them Now they even hit on male guests while they are walking with a wife or girlfriend.
20,We stayed on Jan 9th in the Octavius room 6484. Our experience in the past at Caesars has been wonderful but never stayed in the Octavius tower before. First we needed to call for our luggage because heaven forbid we check in a few hours early. Dirtiest phone I have ever encountered. Floor was not clean or vacuumed. Light beside bed burned out. Loved the jacuzzi tub but before we decided to use it there was so much hair on the floor beside it we did not use it. Then take a shower with a shower head that does not turn down so the only thing it hits is your head. Two sinks but cold faucet on one did not work. Carpet stained horribly. I would think the amount of money we left in the machines they could do a few updates. Very dated furniture and room. Never again.
10,We had a reservation and arrived at the hotel at about noon. If you want a room before 3pm Caesars wants extra money. It‚Äôs not that a room wasn‚Äôt available but Caesars wants more money for your reservation if you want to check in before 3pm.  This was a first for us. Never have I had to wait for a room if it was available or pay extra.  Last time a Caesar‚Äôs Palace for us!
20,Caesars was our go to for many years. This trip we realized it's glory days are gone. Rooms in much need of repair torn furniture walls dirty bathrooms in disrepair. Definitely will NOT come back. Drinks nearly 20.00 so disappointed!!!
10,We booked the Labor day weekend for three nights by phone and told me that the stay was free. At the check out find a charge for the resort fee of $156.00 When I asked what for the answer was everybody pay for it it was a very bad answer they said when I complained the disclosure was at the check in they snick in the charge because at the check in everybody is looking to in the room and when you check in they don't show you the computer screen with the disclosure VERY BAD and take advantage of many people. CESAR PALACE shame on you!!!!!
10,they overcharged me. i paid in advance for all my stay and for the parking and was asked to pay 300$ deposit that i was to get back at the end of my stay but when i left i got back less then half of the deposit with no explanation.    they made a mistake and now i need to chase after them... terible stay ruind my vacation. there are better hotel at the stirp
40,Keli at the diamond check-in desk provided an exemplary experience on Jan 8 2023. She is patient knowledgeable friendly welcoming and very sweet. We hope to see her on our next visit. A true asset to Caesars Palace Las Vegas!
50,Had the best experience at Diamond check in Sunday January 8 with Keli. Since I was a new Diamond plus member she took the time to explain my new benefits. Keli is very customer focused. Your lucky to have her as an employee!
40,Coffee maker in the room with no coffee creamer sugar or stirrers. Such a tease. In the tub the switch from the faucet to the handheld device was impossible to open. Finally my husband got it to work. Caesars should provide complimentary water upon upgrade. Otherwise very nice stay and looking forward to many more stays at your resort.
10,This was by far the worst hotel experience I have had in Vegas and I will not be staying there again. When we first arrived we were very early so we went to the front desk to inquire about early check in. We were told that the only way we could do that was by upgrading to a very expensive room. We obviously declined and went and got some breakfast. We then went back to the front desk to inquire again and we were told that we could possibly have an early check in for a charge of $50. We decided to go with this and they would call or email us as soon as the room was ready. 5 or 6 hours later with still no word we went back to check and as it turns out the room was ready a half hour after we had left the front desk. They did give us the $50 back but there was no apology or anything. Already frustrated and exhausted at this point we made our way up to the room and found the view was lacking (we had a direct view of their HVAC system) and when I went to put my clothes away the drawer fell apart. When we called down to report the drawer they said they would send someone to fix it which they did but we were asleep and they said they would come back later and they never did. When we went to the front desk to ask to change to a room with a better view they said you get what you pay for. We paid more at Caesars than we had at any other hotel casino in the area along with a higher resort fee so it just didn‚Äôt feel right to be told that. Our room was called a ‚ÄúDeluxe‚Äù suite and clearly was not and additionally we paid the same resort fees as someone who was visiting in the summer would have and none of those things are offered in the winter. The pool etc‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.Basically we paid for expensive terrible wifi service. Overall a shoddy room for the price and terrible customer service. Will never stay there again despite the great location. The location is the only reason this place even got one star.
30,The customer service was awful. We asked for an early check in the hotel front desk clerk could only off expensive upgrade. Few minutes later went to different clerk and got early check in for $50 they would txt or email when ready. 5-6 hours later with no notification we went in to check if room was ready. The room was ready 30 min after we initially asked for the early check in but they failed to notify us. We did get the money back but with out any apology. The room view was of the rooftop of lower level of hotel nothing but heat vents and ac units. When asked if we could move we were told you get what you paid for. So much for a Julius deluxe room deluxe it was not!
30,We got the octavius room and I was surprised that a lot of places in the washroom paint was peeling off. The jet in the bathtub was not working either.    You at limited to two free wifi with your resort fee and I thought that was underwhelming for today's travellers. 1 phone and 1 computer or ipad per person would be over the limit and you would have to pay $15/day PER device.    I know it's Vegas but....    The restaurants in Caesars are also just ok for the same price as other hotels. The Venetian and Palazzo restaurants tasted better.
40,Debated giving only 3 stars but went with 4 because overall the stay was fine. The room had comfortable beds but did NOT have a coffee maker despite the fact that the honor bar included K-Cups for coffee. Not sure how we were supposed to use the K-cups without a coffee machine. Reduced a star because there was no convenient bedside power available for all our gadgets. Internet was fine but we were charged because we connected more than 2 devices. Valet parking was crazy expensive at $50/day. Part of the hanging closet included the HVAC system with the worst looking dusty filter I‚Äôd ever seen. Did not want to hang my clothes anywhere near that. Maid service came every day which is rare since Covid.
10,We had made a reservation for 3 nights. 27th to the 31st of December 2022. I took my wife to Las Vegas to see Adele presenting in the coliseum at Caesar‚Äôs palace basically for the convenience of going down the elevator and walking a few steps to the concert because Uber prices and travel times are always high at those times. ANYWAY‚Ä¶    When we made it to the room we were very surprised to see a dark outdated room with everything looking dirty scratched  stains on couches carpet etc. Really disgusting. My wife was really grossed out so I went to the lobby and asked to speak to the manager his name was BRAD at first he said he could not do anything due to the short time of cancellation. After I insisted he told me he could reimburse me for the other two nights but not the first one. He really didn‚Äôt seem to care obviously they have so many people those days they really do not care if you leave another person will go and fill your spot.    So I ended up paying double hotel for my first night in Vegas night for my first day. We stayed at the cosmopolitan (way way better at the same price).    I though I remembered Caesar‚Äôs palace to be a good hotel a while back when I stayed here once but I guess they think it will last forever and don‚Äôt follow up on these details. Also the pictures you see when making a reservation look way to different to the real thing.
10,Unfortunately I attended a wedding here In December. What a mistake I had pretty much given up on this property but I thought 2 nights it should be okay. Big mistake! Right from the start the stay was complicated and difficult. Check in took 25 minutes my room was not good and I could only connect 2 devices and Wi-Fi kept kicking me off. I had room service the food was dreadful. I had a bad smell in my room and there were stains on my carpet. They refunded the resort fee. On the second day I got woken up by maintenance staff about my problem TV that I had asked to be fixed the night before. All in all just terrible but I know nobody at the hotel cares because you just can credit back the resort fee.
20,"I would like to share my experience of my stay from 01/02/23-01/04/23. The arrival set the tone. As 3pm check-in is always busy I knew that check-in would be a challenge. From the moment we entered the building from self park only to learn that only 1 of the four elevators was actually working. This added 30 minutes to the already 45 minute hike from self park to check-in. It was another 45 minutes once I got to check-in waiting in line. As Caesar's has aquired nearly every hotel which we adventured into they all were in disarray. Escalators broken maids opening our room door before 9am without a courtesy knock (even with the DND card on the door). No Microwave no mini fridge and when I cleared out the Mini-bar to make room for leftovers everything I took out ended up on my bill at check-out in spite of it all being returned the day before check-out. No Blow Dryer??? This was not the adventure of ""Living like an Emperor""it was said to be. highly disappointed!"
10,This is a famous hotel in Las Vegas and in great location. I don't think they care about one star review but this review just try to benefit future guest. This is an old hotel - not only the building but also the staff are not very friendly. I arrived a 3:15pm and the reception said the check-in time is 4:00pm and he can't find any room available although the check-out time is 11:00am. What he tried to do is to persuade me to upgrade to another room which is expensive. After argue a few minute then he found maybe the worst room in the building. I can't imagine there is a guest room which is 2 feet away facing a huge tank. Since I was there for just 2 days and most of time not in the room it's not a big deal. Then the TV got wrong and keep on and off I have to ask somebody to fix otherwise no way to sleep. It's right next to Bellagio and have many shopping store but charge guest $18 parking per day is a big minus. They charge $50 resort fee but only allow connect 2 devices to wi-fi. Also the signal in the guest room is very bad I got much strong signal down stair in the casino. Maybe they try to force you to connect more device to wi-fi which is $15 per day extra
30,Ceasars Palace had been my favorite hotel in Las Vegas since 1992! I stayed there this New Years and it just simply wasn‚Äôt the same. The quality customer service the staff was renowned for not there. It was extremely crowded with slot machines and lots of people. The lines for everything was extremely long and the prices are astronomical for what you get. I was there with someone that was a highly rated player so the lines didn‚Äôt effect me but I were going to Vegas without that status I definitely wouldn‚Äôt stay at Ceasars or even visit. There was no entertainment at night and nothing to do other than play slot machines. I‚Äôm a table player and it simply wasn‚Äôt inviting. The walk from the Palace Tower to the spa or valet was a 10 minute walk. The property has gotten too large and the staff seems miserable. I was truly sadden to see my favorite hotel in the world have gotten to be such a cheap experience. There wasn‚Äôt even coffee shower gel or a dirt clothes bag in the room.
50,This hotel is something to see.They upgraded our room for my 40th birthday and it was amazing.  Service and everything else is on top level .  They deserve every penny what we pay .For sure we will come back again not just because of city but because of you guys.Thank you for amazing vacation
10,Listen carefully DO NOT STAY AT CEASAR‚ÄôS PALACE. The hotel IS NOT/NOT set up for guest services. The in room service via your cell phone NEVER worked the entire time we stayed there (six days). The room was filthy there was a dirty hand towel left on the night stand who knows whose DNA was on it. Could not get a human to come to the room to fix the room up. When we saw a room service rep in the hallway she told us ‚Äúyour not on my list‚Äù then walked away. We went to the front desk to complain about the room and asked for the Consierge they didn‚Äôt know what that meant. Hotel Wi-Fi and cell phone connectivity was nonexistent. You have to go outside the hotel to connect. No egg station at the buffet and you have to go directly to the restaurant to get a reservation‚Ä¶because the hotel‚Äôs menu system is broken. We‚Äôve stayed at The Mirage The Bellagio and the Frontier all were better than CEASAR‚ÄôS. Oh and for reference WE‚ÄôRE NEVER GOING BACK!!!
30,Our stay at Caesars Palace was overrated. The staff are not helpful the room was old and outdated and the concierge services were so hopeless so we struggled to book a few club experiences.    It was a great bucket list item as the casino and mall is beyond beautiful but the stay isn't worth it I would rather stay at another hotel on the strip.
20,"Reserved two 2 queen bedroom Palace Tower rooms with pool view - there's five of us so we were splitting rooms. Went to check in at 4:45 pm. Rooms were assigned at check in and only one of the rooms was ready. Told we would get a text when second room was ready. Put our stuff in ready room and went to dinner.    Went back to front desk after dinner around 8:15 so we've already been waiting for 3.5 hours and it's over 4 hours after official check in time. Front desk clerk goes in the back to 'talk to the manager' (this whole process felt soooo much like buying a car) comes back with ""Room is being cleaned right this moment. We are going to give you $100 food and beverage credit for the delay. Your room should be ready in no more than an hour."" Ok.......    It's now 9:10 we go back to front desk. Second verse same as the first. Front desk clerk goes in the back to see the elusive manager comes back with ""Room is being cleaned right this moment."" I interrupted her and said well that's exactly what we were told an hour ago and I'm a bit afraid of a room that's taking this long to clean. My husband explains we've got kids we need to go to bed at this point we are paying for time in a room we don't even have. She goes right back to the manager (or whoever it is that really hangs out back there) and FINALLY gets us assigned to a different room albeit it on a different floor. I don't care. I am exhausted and just want to go to sleep.    My daughter and I took the new room. We'd been in the room for about 30 minutes when housekeeping showed up saying they were there to clean the room. After a bit of discussion and confusion on the Housekeeping end we all figured out that 1) the original assigned room had not been cleaned; and 2) the cleaning order had been moved with me when I got the new room. If we hadn't pushed for the new room looks like it would have been closer to 11 pm before the room would have been ready.    Lo and behold when we finally got settled we realized the tv remote was missing. We did get a new one within 45 minutes but goodness.    Despite all of the shenanigans we did like the room!    Pros:  *Rooms in Palace Tower were clean and well kept  *Bathroom areas were spacious with separate room for the toilet  *Restaurants in resort were very good and appealing. Fantastic breakfast at Cafe Americano  *Caesars is iconic with Vegas and does a good job of capturing the feel of over the top Vegas    Cons:  *Everything in our experience above  *Casino area more smoky than some others  *1 working elevator 3 broken when it came to accessing self park  *Cafe Americano right there in the registration lobby doesn't take food and beverage credits"
10,At $300/night my 4 night stay around NYE was awful. The hotel had no coffee machine or fans in the bathrooms. Doors to the bathroom does not lock and makes noise as you open and close it. Constant mechanical knocking sounds were heard 24-7 and wifi only works on two devices you can‚Äôt even switch the device. All that is acceptable given this hotel sells at $30 during non-busy season what‚Äôs unacceptable is the fact they route all your guest service calls from the room to some offshore call center where they tell lies‚Ä¶ like a missed housekeeping service will be made up ‚Äòsoon‚Äô but no one never show up after 6 calls keeping you waiting for 6 hours into the midnight! two of the calls they transferred and then dropped and they will never transfer to a manager. Worse yet after going downstairs to speak with staff inside the building I waited 30 min. for a manager to show up she credited me only a $50 food and beverage voucher to which the hotel Did Not Honor at time of checked out‚Ä¶! The manager lied about it making me spend more money that I would later be asked to pay back! The manager‚Äôs business card had numbers that weren‚Äôt reachable during regular business hours making it impossible to chase this down. Everyone‚Äôs very quick to saying ‚Äòthat‚Äôs the best I can do‚Äô.    During my multiple trips to the registration desk I noticed my issues were frequent occurrences. Another couple‚Äôs room didn‚Äôt get cleaned and another group‚Äôs food and beverage $ weren‚Äôt credited to their room. This was the most awful hotel/motel experience I‚Äôve ever experienced and the most intentionally concerted efforts by hotel staff to brush you aside and rip you off. I get the feeling that this is going beyond any individual staff‚Äôs inabilities but into the gray zone of doing it on purpose. Between making the missed housekeeping request (we couldn‚Äôt shower since all towels were used and thrown on the floor for removal and trash piled up high in our rooms) over the phone and in person I‚Äôve waisted no less than 2 hours just attempting to get in touch with someone responsible. And now I‚Äôm volunteering another hour writing this review.    I went to their website to write a feedback there was only a Q&A email link and even that requires 5 days for a response.    Whatever you do‚Ä¶ avoid this hotel!
10,Horrible hotel. Rude and uncaring staff. I stay at hotels approx 100 nights a year and am appalled at the lack of service by all the staff whether it be at the bars restaurants gaming tables housekeeping and the phone system. I will NEVER stay here again and recommend anyone reading this post take heed and not stay here.
40,Never once had housekeeping visit our room. Four nights and after the third I asked for fresh towels and soap. Hotel is well kept and our room was upgraded (not for free) for a much nicer suite with a large jetted tub and separate walk in shower. This was requested but since our booked and paid for room type was full.
40,It was beautiful. PROS: All the scenery and staff was very elegant! Maria Sarabia was the agent that checked me in and she was so accommodating and such a great personality. Also Jasmin Shaw was AMAZING! I had an issue with the wrong beds and she made it so easy and pleasant during that transaction. Wish I had always had a checkin experience like that at other hotels. CONS: It was the card tables had a limited amount of tables with a low minimum. I don‚Äôt like to start off at $50 or a $100 min. So I didn‚Äôt use their tables to gamble. Other con was the valet wasn‚Äôt too available. Getting to valet and then wasn‚Äôt allowed to use it because I wasn‚Äôt a diamond card holder so we had to self parking which was inconvenient. But overall this was a great Las Vegas hotel to stay at. I would definitely stay there again.
10,Booked this as an extra special holiday for husbands milestone birthday. Worst hotel I have stayed in. After an extremely lengthy check in we were told that the pool view 2 double Queen bed room booked was not available but 'upgraded' us to a suite. Happy with this obviously but wanted to confirm there were 2 separate beds as we were travelling with a teenager. Was told yes definitely 2 beds. Got to the room - one bed only and one dirty busted broken pull out bed that was not fit for purpose but also filthy. Half the lights didn't work either which was handy when arriving in the dark! After several calls to reception who seem to put you on hold whenever you speak to them and then never come back and finally demanding to speak to a manager and ask for the bed to be looked at it was agreed by a visiting representative that room was not fit for a family and a roll-out bed was bought to the room and we would be moved the following day. After the guy left we rolled out yet another broken bed! Flat as a pancake with protruding springs again!!!  So first night in 5 star hotel my child ended up finally getting to ‚Äòbed' at 2.30am after checking in at 10pm sleeping on sofa cushions!  Apparently one of the unhelpful reception staff in formed us it doesn‚Äôt really matter what room you‚Äôve booked it‚Äôs what they have available when you check in‚Ä¶..erm not heard of that before!  Moved us finally the next day to a double bedded room with 2 standard beds dirty curtains dirty carpet scratched dented old furniture.  Definitely not a luxury hotel once you get to the rooms. I was shocked by the state of it. Everything broken and old from the beds furniture - even down to the ironing board! I won‚Äôt even start on the attempt to charge for extra WIFI due to us having to change rooms and they were claiming that we were trying to link too many devices. The list of negatives is just endless.  I've never been so disappointed with staying anywhere so much. The reception staff will say anything to get rid of you in a hurry and then when you phone to speak to them go missing or cut you off. Come on Caesar's! You really can't claim a luxury status with this type of service and those rooms! We chose this rather than the Luxor where we've stayed before expecting a really luxurious experience and paying a far more hefty price tag for it. Disappointed doesn‚Äôt cover it. Thanks Caesars :(
40,Reading reviews is exhausting! I am pretty picky especially when it comes to my accommodations but seriously some people have no business writing reviews. Not to mention a lot of people act like they live in pristine mansions where everything is perfect. Come on people this is Vegas and this is a massive resort everything will not be perfect so try being a little more reasonable with your expectations.    We are long time M Life members and we always stay at Aria. After trying many places on the strip we have sort of settled on our preferred choice there. The Christmas time winter storm was coming and we got a flight out of Texas early to miss it. We didn't have any more comped nights at Aria so we had to find another hotel for a few nights. We got more comped nights at Caesar's because we have Caesar's Rewards too. I was a little leery about staying somewhere new and especially some place as huge as Caesar's.    First mistake we used self parking on our first night. From self parking there was only one elevator to the casino and hotel because the others were not working and they did not work the entire time we were there. This was the worst time they could have elevators out because the lines are long even in the best of circumstances and even worse during Christmas holidays. To roll your bags from self parking to the front of the hotel is a major pain and I don't recommend it. When you do have to roll them on carpet it's hard and it's a very long walk. In hindsight it would have been worth the $50 valet fee that first night to just pull up to the front of the hotel!    Then you see the insanely long lines at check-in. So even though we had request for certain things pertaining to a room we wanted we said forget it and used the kiosk. People go to the far left side of the front desk and use the automatic kiosk that will take you a couple of minutes to get a room key! If you just want a room use it and you want stand in line forever! That's crazy!    We didn't get help finding our Premium Tower King room directions are scarce and not easy to see or find. One employee gave us a map that was a map of the strip! really lady were trying to find our room! The premium tower rooms are the furtherest away and it's a pretty good walk again with your bags. From self parking to the room was exhausting! But once on our floor it was nice and quiet. Our room was fine. As a previous review stated the strip view shows just a little bit of the strip you see the Mirage and the top floor of the parking garage mostly so don't expect a good view from these rooms. But the room was a good size the bathroom was too. I loved the vanity area to do my makeup it was so nice to be able to sit down and do that.    The room was clean and it wasn't falling apart yes a few nics here and there on furniture but only if you looked hard. They don't have time or resources to do paint touch ups on every piece of furniture so get your expectations in check. It's not a big deal. The bed was good and I don't usually say that. What I didn't like was the totally useless pillows that don't support your head your head just sinks in. I asked for more and was told they don't have ANY extra pillows. Wow! And the insanely heavy duvets like the hotel is 40 below! I will never understand why hotels use such heavy duvets. Were in a temperature controlled environment were not freezing why do we need these big heavy duvets? It's too much and there is not a blanket to use. instead.    So in conclusion I was surprised that I had no complaints with the room. The biggest negatives were the walk from the parking garage and to the Palace Tower Rooms. It was a lot! I would absolutely stay here again if I needed to but I would willingly pay for valet to escape the long walk especially when elevators aren't working.    If you found any part of my review helpful then thank you for your helpful vote!
20,We visit Vegas twice a year and usually stay in a different hotel but I really wanted to try Caesars because it is iconic and the lobby looks so beautiful. We found tickets on Travelocity and spent Christmas there. Our room and hallway smelled like mildew. It completely ruined our trip. I called the front desk and mentioned it but was immediately cut off and told that the hotel was booked. The same thing happened when we asked downstairs. I have never had that experience in the other hotels we have stayed in. We spent our money in the bars the restaurants (Cafe AmericanoNobu) as we always do but I was so disappointed with not necessarily the room (because things happen and it can be adjusted) but with the treatment and how we were hurried. We are planning to visit to Vegas in June with my parents and a neighbor told us we have to purchase a more expensive room at Caesars to get better service. That is very sad to me.
10,I was at 4486 room cesar hotel do not clean the room I call in the morning 2 times to say clean the room in the hallway I tell the housekeeping to make the room I give her 3 dolars for tip Is 9pm and my room has not been clean this Is the worst hotel I ever been how can you charge me for a room that you supose to clean!!!!
10,Bad experience on the front desk which reflects the caesars palace image‚Ä¶. Maria which is on duty on december 28 at 9:30 am ‚Ä¶. First of all I work in a guest related field‚Ä¶ overall assessment its bad if she reflects the face of the conpany dont want to fire her just put her behind the desk of office ‚Ä¶ Maria is her name rude unprofessional or I guess you dont need to be professional working on the front desk but at least have seminars to handle different situations she told me in my face she dont need to show compassion to me told her why her voice is loud she did not even apologize  for the whole experience and told her why is she being rude‚Ä¶. I know the corporate will see this  if your employees dont like their job just tell them to look for another‚Ä¶.. one mistake will ruin the vacation  even the food is great the room is clean casinos smells fresh‚Ä¶.. but one person who is not apologizing and saying no compassion I dont know if she is suited in the front desk‚Ä¶. Her name is Maria and I talked to one of the house manager Connor Odyke which is very good and apologize to me numerous times even he is not the one in the front desk‚Ä¶.Mr. Connor shows compassion  for me 5 stars!
30,We stayed in a ‚ÄúStrip View‚Äù room in the Palace Tower (if you craned your neck you could see part of the north end of the Strip but mostly rooftops and the Mirage.) The room was spacious and comfortable with a large jacuzzi tub but the hotel‚Äôs business model appears to be to monetize every single guest service they can. Thus we were charged $20 for ‚Äúearly‚Äù check in (2:30 pm). There was no robe in the room but you could buy them downstairs. Self-parking was $18 even though two of the four elevators were out of order and it was a long wait for the two that did work. This is all on top of the now-ubiquitous $50 daily ‚Äúresort fee.‚Äù Guest service was generally understaffed. Finally the hotel is unbelievably complicated and exhausting to navigate. We‚Äôve always wanted to stay at Caesars but I feel we missed its best days.
10,Casino host rude. Told me to stand outside office for privacy. Fine take out the other desk and two chairs next to her desk. Luanna (?) was so rude and miserable to me . Told me in five days I had only gambled 2 hours 25 min. There was an issue with their players card. I had over 15 of them reprinted because they kept blanking out due to my room key. No one bothered to tell me that the room key would be magnetize it. So she refused to take off my meals which in the seven years I‚Äôve been to Caesars out for Christmas. The only thing I‚Äôve ever had to pay was for tips. The hotel is very dated. They need to invest in the rooms as well but since the room was comped. It‚Äôs really hard to complain. I would suggest using MGM properties. They are far nicer and the casino staff from my dealings are very friendly.
30,Flights to Utah from John Wayne Airport (OC. CA) were cancelled so my lady and I decided to call an audible and treck the Vegas. After stop and go traffic for 6.5 hours we arrived at Caesars our go-to hotel on the strip and were greeted by a very helpful and charming concierge named Chanice who helped get us settled in our room. The room was great spacious and clean - with the exception of the water room.    This is the only time we have experienced dissappointment on this front. We got in late and did not discover what I am to describe until the next morning when we wanted to take a bath.    The bath tub was a mess. I am not sure if there had been a back flow from plumbing at some point or if someone had emptied a vacuum in it but there was a large amount of dirt sand debri in the tub. Huge bummer because we had snow boarded the day before. Typically we havent used the tub on our visits but we were sore and looking forward to it. The bidet also looked like it hadnt been cleaned.    As I mentioned apart from the rub incident the room was delightful with a great view clean sheets and well kept. This downside won't keep us from visiting again we will just be doing a more thorough walk through upon check-in.
10,I have been looking forward to my stay at Caesars Palace for the last year. However right from the time I arrived I was wildly disappointed. The room I got was outdated and untidy the furniture and carpet looked rundown and we didn't even have simple amenities such as soap. However I did not want this to ruin my trip. After taking a shower I noticed that the towel I was using was still dirty with dark stains on them. Then with closer inspection of the room I noticed that the floors were not vacuumed cups were still dirty and hair was still in the corners of the room and bed.    I was really frustrated and angry and went to the front desk to ask for compensation. I spoke to the front desk and was offered either a $100 dine-in credit or a room change. I asked to speak with the manager Ms. Nunez who stated that it was not their fault that the room was not the standard because things like this happened. The way she spoke to me was condescending and made me feel like it was my fault that the room was dirty.    My family member who was with me was then told that she could not talk to Ms. Nunez because she was only allowed to speak to the person who booked the room. I was then told that I could take what was offered or check out early. I opted to check out early because I was made to feel like I was not welcome and my concerns were not important. The staff there was very defensive and accusatory. I was very disappointed at the service that was provided at Caesars Palace especially for the luxury price point we pay to stay there. I will never stay here again. How is it not standard to provide a paying customer with a clean room?
50,I cannot say enough good things about Caesar‚Äôs. I‚Äôve never been to Vegas and was going for the Adele concert we wanted to be as close to the venue as possible so decided Caesar‚Äôs made the most sense. I had read some reviews about the hotel and they seemed mixed so I was skeptical but so glad I booked! Check in isn‚Äôt until 4pm but our flight arrived at 8am so we decided to see if they could hold our bags so we could explore and they said yes but also offered an upgrade to check in immediately. For only $120 we got a fountain view and could check in 8 hours early absolutely worth it! The entire staff wherever we went was so friendly offering suggestions and assistance. The casinos and restaurants really try to push alcohol and drinks everywhere you go but I found all of Vegas was like that. I highly recommend staying on the strip as everything is much more walkable and accessible but Caesar‚Äôs rooms were clean roomy extravagant and worth every penny! It was pretty chilly when we went so having shops restaurants and venues all connected indoors was a huge plus to staying at Caesar‚Äôs. When comparing prices to other places on the strip Caesar‚Äôs comes in more affordable and the amenities make up for it.
30,Caesars Palace has long been our go-to destination in Las Vegas. And it still has its charms. But it‚Äôs slipping. We stayed in an Augustus Tower fountain view room for 3 nights. It‚Äôs spacious and comfortable. But ‚Ä¶    So much of the customer service focus has declined. Only one soap bar for the sink and shower. It took a couple efforts to get a Keurig in our room. Our requests for extra pillows was turned down even though a lot of rooms were vacant in the days before Christmas. The Starbucks near Augustus was understaffed creating delays.    Caesars will always generate fond memories but we‚Äôre not that inspired to go back.
20,Overall a nice experiance but they stick it to you at every opprotunity.  $50 a night for Valet parking  $10 surcharge for a ATM withdrawal  $52 a day Resort Fee and pool is not even open.  Reservation touts in room coffee make but neglects to inform the actal coffee is $20 for two pods.
20,Checked in today the hotel looked dated and room is below par with the price paid sort of feeling cheated and perhaps should have done better research before booking.    Visiting vegas after 14 years and this property has lost shine unfortunately will ask for refund tomorrow.
10,Worst hotel ever ! Dirty room ! Dust everywhere sheets not changed and hair in the pillows ! The most disgusting room ever ! Not even a read motel I‚Äôm is this conditions  Paid more and move to a ‚Äú better and renovated room ‚Äú at least was clean  Terrible service my room is not made yes it‚Äôs 205 pm and I left the room at 8 am  Called twice already  terrible service over the phone too  and still nothing    AVOID THIS PROPERTY
10,This place was insanely rediculous. The carpet in our room was lifting from the floor the HVAC was banging more than us the water was warm at best and the restaurants in the food court area especially Bobby‚Äôs restaurants were slower than molasses in January. We waited a half hour in line and they only helped one person and made 2 milkshakes.    Unless you have a ton of money and show it or are part of their top two card levels they do not care about you one bit. If you call an Uber or Lyft be prepared to meet them at the loading docks because that‚Äôs where they pick you up.
10,After standing in line for what seemed to be a hour to check in to Octavia‚Äôs Tower we checked into a severely dated dark and dingy room. This place is a throwback to 1980 and hasn‚Äôt been touched since. Peeling cracking pleather headboard to filthy dirty drapes and carpet it severely shows it‚Äôs age.    Housekeeping is a complete disaster!!! I called to ask to change sheets clean filthy bathtub with strange black hair and goodness what else in it after our first day as it was so  dirty. We got back to room after midnight and the room had not been touched. The service room light still being on. I tried to call housekeeping and was told sorry they will send someone up sometime- no particular time - just sometime. I called just after midnight and now it is 1am - nobody is here!!    Do yourself a favor and stay at one of the many many other hotels on the strip and save yourself one issue after another.
20,We just checked in as my brother in law is getting married here tomorrow. I called requesting a robe which I normally do as part of a comfortable travel experience. I was told that I should go down to the gift shop and buy one. Wow really? Not the level of service I have experienced at other hotels. I will choose another option next time.
50,Our room was amazing! Sal at the front desk is the best receptionist I have ever had the pleasure of working with! He deserves a raise because he has won our loyalty for Cesar‚Äôs palace! P.S. this is our first time staying here and we are pleasantly surprised ! But as a side note please fix all the elevators.
30,The lobbies were decorated lovely however our room in the Forum Tower was very dated. Wall paper was peeled away from the wall the furniture in our room looked like something from a Rummage sale nicks all over the dressers and night stands. The vending machines on our floor were either not working or were unplugged. Our bed was very comfortable. Luckily we snagged the room for a good price had we paid the normal price this would have been more of a disappointment.
20,First I want to start by saying that is one of the most beautiful buildings on the strip and the shops make it a magical experience.  We stayed at the Octavius room it was spacious with a great view of the strip. There were some minor issues with the room like one of the climate controls didn't work coffee area wasn't stock and the phone in the room was inactive. But ok I didn't mind since no hotel is perfect. Then the bad started when the hotel had construction starting on the room above us. It basically went on for the majority of our stay; hammering drilling we couldn't relax all morning. Then on our last day the internet wasn't available which I paid forI missed a day of work from not being able to use my laptop. I couldn't contact hotel desk cause the phones are down. I go down to the lobby waited about 20mins to talk to somebody and all they offer was a number for me to dial to get help. Operator on the phone put me on 15 min wait just to end up hanging up on me. I went back down to the lobby to wait another 15 mins to talk to someone again. I explained everything that happened and the only thing I was offer was a food voucher that could not even use because most restaurants were closed until dinner and this was our last day.  My point is I wasted most of my morning I wanted to have one more nice memory with my family there and the emphaty that I didn't receive from the staff completely changed our vacation.  I might give Caesars another chance but until there's changes made within the hotel I'm booking somewhere else!
10,Staying at the Octavius Tower for 3 days. I have diamond membership. The three hour check in process at the diamond checkin counter was a nightmare and one of the ladies behind the desk is very unprofessional and rude. I wish I would've gotten her name. We would have been better off going through regular checkin.    We have 4 rooms. One of the rooms that was supposed to have a king bed because it was for a couple had two full size beds. With tattered headboards vomit on the reading light by the bed and wires coming out the other reading light. The room was disgusting. They changed the room of course with barely an apology for the hassle.    All four rooms are in dire need of better housekeeping and maintenance. The walls look like they have not been wiped down in years the phones are dirty paint is coming off the cabinets - its just a run down tired old hotel charging sometimes $600+ a night because of supply and demand.    We were also shown the rooms in the Augustus Tower. Much the same as Octavius just darker and noisier.    Will not be staying here again! Sadly I don‚Äôt think management cares about their guests opinions. They are so busy with many people who will only come to Las Vegas very very occasionally they don‚Äôt bother about repeat business.
10,I attended Adele concert and decided to stay at caesars palace thinking it was upscale resort. What a horrible experience. As an ADA person I found it very non-user friendly. I had to ask where to find actual valet for hotel because signage is poor small and confusing. After finding valet i had to walk down construction active ramp with god ugly red curtains and then try to find a restroom. Continuing on I felt I walked a damn mile to get to kiosks at check-in area where kiosk didn't work although i had pre- registered ok. So now I had to stand in line at check-in. Completely unacceptable. After that it was back to walking to get to julius tower. I have great difficulty walking and I note there's no service from valet to get bags to room. So the entire time I'm walking with my carry on and other items. I thought their resort was high end but I was completely mistaken. I will never stay at Caesars ever again. First experience was my last. There are way too many better choices in Las Vegas. One positive note....ADELE was phenomenal and worth every penny. Best show ever.
10,front desk staff and manageress rude and unhelpful. Had booked room for a week months before only to be told on booking in we couldn‚Äôt have it. Lied when staff said we had been given an upgrade given an old room with an air conditioning unit outside the window. When questioning the upgrade the manageress said she tell her staff to lie about it. Was told it was that room or nothing. asked to be given our room which we had upgraded to asked for a high floor but got a room on the lowest floor obviously out of spite. Don‚Äôt think they like the English. No free coffee machine or bottle of water very poor room service probably 3 days out of the 6. Worst hotel we‚Äôve ever stayed in on the strip. Obviously this hotel thinks they‚Äôre extra special believe me your not
30,Hotel was nice Nicole and dime you for everything coffee in room $20 Mandatory Resort Fee of $52 a day not disclosed till checkout pools all closed said it was for fitness center and wifi and everyone has to pay. Hotel rooms were really nice (Palace Tower). All prices in hotel very expensive. Hotel is like a small city food in resturaunt a outstanding but quadruple what you would normally pay. Overall a nice stay staff was great and hotel was clean with great rooms
10,If you are going to Caesar‚Äôs for the first time don‚Äôt. It is a huge waste of your money. Between the service at the front desk the lackluster rooms the lack of attention to details that should matter etc there is not much good I can say about the place other than the food at Gordon Ramsay‚Äôs Pub was fantastic. As for the the stay I could have stayed literally anywhere else on the strip for half the cost.
10,Stayed there for 2 weeks:  $700 for a resort fee - no pool / internet does not work  $1400 held on CC for incidentals maxing out my CC for the 2 weeks.  Absolute rude staff  Drinks charged to room when mini bar not even touched or opened - try to argue that is very painful  Charged late checkout even though I was lining up before checkout time. - 45mins probably because every one was arguing the nickle and diming
20,"I hated all the extra costs mounted on room rate.    The $50/nt baloney ""resort fee"" stinks but I'm starting to get used to that in Vegas. But they also collect an additional up-front $100/nt for ""incidentals""! So what if it's eventually ""reimbursable?"" This means Caesars is amassing an enormous bank account of ""incidentals cash"" that they can use however they want - even earning interest on money that's not theirs. Shouldn't there be a class action lawsuit against such unscrupulous behavior?    The in room coffee maker isn't free. You have to buy the coffee from the exceedingly pricey minibar so you can brew the coffee yourself. Don't let tge words ""in room coffee maker"" mislead you.    The whole collection of such extra charges feels like a big rip off. I wouldn't stay here again unless I absolutely had no other choice. This hotel business should start appreciating their customers rather than making us feel abused."
30,Beautiful hotel but the fact they cannot provide you with coffee for the coffee maker makes me not want to go back. Previous occupants hair left in the shower. They never cleaned our room during our 3 night stay. Called housekeeping to request Kleenex 2nd day but never got them. Won‚Äôt stay again.
20,Went o Vegas for our wedding weekend. We stayed in the Julius tower one bedroom suite. The half bathroom floor looked dirty looked like it had not been clean. There was cereal on the floor by the windows and under the couch. Something was spilled on the night stand next to the bed. We went down to the front desk and they said they would send the housekeeping manager up and provided a food and beverage credit. No one ever came. We called housekeeping and they attempted to provide another credit. We just wanted our room clean. Finally someone comes up and cleans the room and puts new bedding on the bed. After watching them clean I can see how so much gets missed. They do not clean the floor with an actual mop. She used a towel. The room definitely needed a deep cleaning
10,Parking on opposite Far End of casino to registration desk unless you use valet at $50. Had to carry everything no dollies available. Exhausting.  Had to check closely my receipt and found charges that shouldn‚Äôt have been there. They did easily refund though.  They provide a coffee machine that takes pods but doesn‚Äôt provide the pods. Charge $22.50 for four pods!  The rooms were clean‚Ä¶.  We stayed at the Hilton just prior and had the opposite experience‚Ä¶  And came back with Covid!
10,Our Fly was too Late. I called the Hotel to Tell we are getting Late. The Woman tells everything ok. Theres no Problem. When we arived our room was canceled and no other room was free. No help no Pardon ore cashback from the Hotel.  After 5 days of fighting we get a Bit of the Money back Bit Not everything- and we dont get any Service of them. It was a horrorbil moment and they make the mistakeand dont see that. Thay say its My fault.
30,Be very careful regarding security deposit.3 weeks later and multiple emails and it still hasn't been returned.Couldnt fault the room or the hotel itself.Queue at check-in was crazy.Some staff are slow and stop.
10,I was mistakenly charged $80 for drinks and food I bought in hotel bar. Apparently the cleaning lady found empty boxes in thrash and charged as taken from minibar. I am considering this as fraud but cannot be fixed after check out and travelling back to Europe.
40,It is my 6 time at this hotel over 15 years.  I must say it great but seems to lost some of its shine. I feel as if it require a bit of a lift but even with that said this is still one of my favorites after the Venetian :)  Location is great near the fountains and the shopping area at the forum.
10,"I have stayed at Caesars Palace for years and after this trip (I returned today) I will never go back. The rooms (and I bought a ""nice"" room) were outdated dirty had poor cleaning service and had no amenities. You must pay $21 in the mini bar for the pods for the Nespresso machine! There are no robes there is one bar of soap in the bathroom and the furniture was stained worn and dirty. Glassware in the bathroom was spotted and had lip marks on it. I was shockingly charged for two items in the mini bar that I did not use and the explanation is that I must pay for items if they are ""moved"".    I was there for a 3 day conference. There were no places in the conference center to even sit and make phone calls in the hallway. The chairs in the meeting rooms were sparse (standing room for many) and the room cold virtually no water or coffee.    The service at the hotel was iffy overall. Don't stay at Caesars. Just don't."
20,Not what it used to be. Tables were limited and not very crowded. Poor job of explaining charges in advance. $52 ‚ÄúResort Fee‚Äù charged daily for local calls and wifi is ridiculous. Nothing special about staying at Caesars.    Will go back to staying at the The Venetian.
30,Parking $18/day for hotel guest - unacceptable  Charging $35 for a one hour late check out when attending a conference at Caesar's - unacceptable  Requiring a review to be at least 200 characters - really?  The hotel is clean and the room was average but charging for everything just doesn't work for me
20,We paid for an ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù to a filthy room with a random pill on the floor. We were offered a room change which required us to move all our stuff to the other side of the hotel so we declined and instead they waived the upgrade fee and assured us that housekeeping would remedy the issue. They did not fix the issues at all which was extremely disappointing.  The lampshade had crust on it the phone display was broken the bathroom had what appeared to be feces all over the wall and the vents were disgusting. We splurged on this hotel thinking it would be fantastic and deeply regret wasting our money on this.  Looking for luxury? Look elsewhere
10,Caesars Palace needs updating. Rooms are outdated stained sofa and filthy vents in an upgraded room in Augusta Towers. No robes or slippers you have to purchase in gift shop. They nickel & dime you‚Ä¶. Extra charge for more than 2 devices on WiFi; $5.95 for corkscrew; No complimentary coffee pay for coffee but room has keurig & cups. THERE ARE BETTER LAS VEGAS HOTELS !!
10,The manager Julissa was very rude and took forever to come out and speak with me and my family at the vip registration Horrible experience she also wasn‚Äôt any help at all we waited to speak with her for nothing I will never stay there again
10,Super disappointing. The service was terrible room was dated and damaged our view from the room was of the rooftop mechanicals and no pool access even though their website stated year round pool. I was there for a conference. When I booked it gave me the option for early check in which I selected since my flight would land at 7 am. As it approached noon I called the hotel number to see what time I could get into the room. They told me I would have to go to the hotel desk and ask. If you are self parking make sure you are in shape because it is about a 15 minute walk from the garage to the hotel desk. Once I arrived they told me it would be an additional $50 despite it being an option on my conference booking. We opted to come back later to check in. When we arrived at our room I was so disappointed. In addition to the damaged furniture and terrible view there was residue all over the bathroom floor and counter. I took a washcloth and soapy water and wiped down areas that needed it. Two of the pillows on the bed had an odor to them. We tried calling the desk stopping by the desk and asking the housekeeping staff for assistance getting them replaced. They never were replaced. On Friday night there were several elevators not working leading to long waits to get to and from our room. Finally the conference I attended ran until 12:30 pm on Saturday. Despite late check out again being an option on the booking they would not accommodate it making the logistics to get out of the room and be able to attend the final keynote really challenging. It was just a debacle all around. Don't waste your hard earned money on this place. We ended up staying at Excalibur later on in our post-conference vacation and it was a much better experience.
20,Prob our first and last stay here at Caesars Palace hotel. The comfort of room jacuzzi tub and easy access to The Colosseum were about the only thing we enjoyed.    2 stars: We were booked on 22 floor of the palace tower. Upon arrival I was expecting the room to be what they advertised on their website. But we were missing a couch and coffee table. This ‚Äúsitting‚Äù area was diminished to a one person chair and end table. Resort fees are 52.50 a night which include internet service for 2 devices (any additional would be $15 per device) gym admission for 2 people per day and finally pool use. But wait. All pools are closed for the season. So why is Caesar‚Äôs charging the same ‚Äúresort fee‚Äù when guests aren‚Äôt given the same amenities in the winter? It‚Äôs just ridiculous but anything to take advantage of guests.
30,Augustus tower suite. Not comped. Dirty dirty dirty room. Dust blobs on furniture curtains and floors (have pictures) long black hairs in shower- I am a blonde makeup fingerprints on all doors and mirrors in bathroom I brought my own Clorox cleaner and Lysol spray cleaned headboards phone remote control & entire bathroom within one hour of checking in. I heard Adele would not stay in this tower‚Äôs suite for her stay- and our way marked down level I see why. Also if you are over a certain age you will not be able to order room service too complicated and limited because you have to use your phone! When o come to a hotel I expect to not be able to feel like someone has stayed in the room before me (this is the sign of a truly great hotel and it‚Äôs housekeeping staff) obviously did not happen here. I want convenience of comfort like room service talking to someone on the phone and having nothing too big being delivered to me in a great hotel in Las Vegas. Gambling area is sad and dated as are the rooms. Next time it‚Äôs the Wynn.
20,"Went to Vegas with my adult son for his first trip to Vegas. Found what I thought was a decent ""Black Friday"" deal for Caesar's Palace so thought this would add to our trip as I've stayed in other Caesar's hotels. Unfortunately my son became ill on our flight into Vegas. Upon arrival he only wanted to check into room be able to take a shower and go to bed. We took an Uber directly to motel and waited in line for check in. Upon getting up to an agent we were told that if they had a room ready for us we'd be incurring an ""early check in"" fee. Unless we wanted to upgrade our room for above that fee and then that would be waived. The guy was extremely pushy took forever playing on his computer and coming up with another ""offer""! We told the agent several times each that we were fine with the original room!! All this time my son is miserable and feels faint and just wants to get into room. I've stayed at least at 10 other hotels resorts on the Vegas strip area. Only once have I not checked in early because of when our flights arrived into Vegas. We have never incurred any fee as long as they have room ready. This was a Tuesday night so obviously not a super busy night in Vegas. The room charge was $55 the resort charge was $52 and then they charged another $55 for early check in. Had my son not been ill we never would have accepted this.  We get up to the room and I expected it to be plush upscale place. Disappointment number 2! Carpet was so stained wood dressers/nightstands were banged up and looked very worn and abused. Curtains were old and actually reminded me of the old Carol Burnett show with the awful looking green curtains! There was absolutely nothing in the room that was glitzy like I had thought that all Caesar's would have.  Next alarming thing was that I made a few trips out of the hotel room to buy my son some meds and water. Twice I walked by the housekeeping staff and another lady talking about how bad the elevators have been on this tower of the hotel. They said that one lady had been stuck on the one ""bad"" elevator for over two hours just the other day. So now I'm staying in mediocre room with sick son and worried that everytime I leave and take an elevator I may be stuck for couple hours. Just the icing on a great trip!!"
10,This trip was booked for 2020 however due to pandemic the trip was delayed till December 2022.    The lobby looked incredible however the check in way slow.    The tax and room deposit was taken straight away with no breakdown or receipt.    We were given the keys to the room. The lift was dirt and damaged not the best of impressions.    When we got into the room there was peeled wall paper scuffs and scratches everywhere. There was even blood on the walls.    This didn‚Äôt feel like we were staying in a five star hotel more like a horror movie.    The room next door were having an all night party. The loud music banging lead to us having no sleep after an 11 hour flight. When we left our room the next morning the guests from the next door had kicked the outside wall in.    Every night we went to the room in fear and barely got any sleep. It appears that this hotel is not a safe haven for anyone.    The checkout was awful we queued for 30mins. It seems that the speed was slow then slow slow.    There are better hotels on the strip which do keep to a five star status.    Do not stay here.
40,The hotel is special if you want to know Las Vegas is an excellent hotel with restaurants shows a shopping mall and different activities to do. Ubicated in the best part of strip street because other hotels are very close even on walking or you can take the monorail to visit the Luxor and Madaline or on the other side Sahara hotel and Firemont street experience. The lobby is spectacular the room is not so much the rooms are common rooms could be improved considering the theme of this hotel.
20,When checking in I was given my first room which was supposed to be in a non-smoking area of the hotel. The room smelled like smoke  carpets were old and sofa /furniture had deep scratches and stains. I switch out my room and the second one seemed to be cleaner. Later that day i found what looked to be a bed bug on one of the beds.. I immediately checked out and stayed in another hotel for the night. Caesars wouldn't even comp me the last night. Stay away!!!!
10,I walked in to my and saw blood stains on the wall. The bed sheets were dirty and the furniture and fixtures were ripped and marked up. The shower was covered in mildew. The ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù room was pretty much the same.
20,I have stayed at almost every one of the older hotels on the strip so I was super pumped to stay at Ceasar's Palace for my conference. What a disappointment!!! They will nickel and dime you for everything and don't dare touch anything in the fridge or they will charge you for using it!! I have stayed at bottom barrel places that at least offered complimentary coffee but not this place!! $19.99 for a couple of Kcups powdered creamer and fake sugar enjoy!! NEVER AGAIN
10,When we were checking in at the front desk we decided to upgrade from king bed to a bigger room since we had 3 guests staying in one room. We paid extra $100 for a 2 queen bed and another roll away mattress. When we got to our room around 2 PM it had one king  roll away and a pull out sofa bed. We were late for an event so we called and Asked the front desk if we could get extra sheets and pillow for the roll away so it would be ready by the time we got back. We did not receive the sheets/pillow until after 9 PM after calling for them twice.  I called the front desk multiple times to request late check out was placed on hold for longer then 10 minutes and and hung up on me once. when I finally got through they told me that they will call me back but never did.  At checkout I asked to speak with someone about my experience  the front desk sent me to the host office and when I got there the host manager said that they sent me to the wrong place and I need to go back to front desk .  I will never book with Caesars again. Worst experience that I‚Äôve ever had in a Las Vegas hotel( by the way the room was over $480 per night)
40,"Want to extend a huge thank you (especially to the concierge and front desk staff) for resolving the issue that I've experienced while staying at the Caesar's Palace last week.    I noticed that the carpet was wet around the perimeter of the shower leading towards the bedroom last Saturday evening. I called the concierge and Amanda was quick to submit a request to the engineering department; she assured me that since this was considered an ""emergency"" that someone would come by to assist ASAP.    After an hour had past I called the concierge multiple times to check on the status. The water damage was spreading quickly. Brian was incredibly empathetic and understanding of my situation. We had multiple phone calls and he had to reach out to several departments his upper management etc. to receive a proper status update and offer me other options. I was pretty frustrated at this point but knew that Brian's department and the engineering dept were two separate entities.    Christian (engineering) knocked on my door after another hour and I was livid. How does it take the engineering department two hours to check on an ""emergency"" request? Made zero sense to me. However he was kind and again empathetic to my situation. He reassured me that I would not get charged for the damages and would make sure that his boss and the front desk received his notes.    A few hours prior to check out: I confirmed with Allison (manager) if she'd like for me to check into another room. I know that Caesar's Palace can afford to fix the issue but wanted to do my part. Allison was kind actively listened to the events of the evening and offered me food/beverage credit along with ensuring that I was able to enjoy my final night at Caesar's. She confirmed that Christian let her know that it was safe for me to stay but I still had the option of moving into a different room if that was my preference.    At check out: Katherine immediately sensed that I was still frazzled and offered me water right away. Despite being new to the job she was extremely knowledgeable of the policies and procedures and reassured me as the customer that this was not the service patrons expect to receive. I could tell that she genuinely cared and same goes for every other person that I have mentioned in this post.    I usually don't leave reviews after experiencing something as severe as water damage. However I truly appreciate the support that I've received from Amanda Brian Allison and Katherine."
10,Looks good on the outside but the room was tatty and dirty. Clumps of black hair hanging on shower wall. Bathroom door would not lock. Old stained carpet with rips and a ripple that was a tripping hazard. No complimentary coffee and if you use the fridge for personal use you get charged $75. If you use the 2 paper cups that go with the coffee machine you get charged. No info in room no pool open even though it was advertised that one pool would stay open during the off season.
40,During my check out i had doubts about my rewards points but the girl doesn¬¥t take a minute to explain me or solve my doubts. I was on a friends trip and we share room when we check in they tolds us that we will earn points by each other and in check out we can join the points to get a discount. Its ok if the rewards point doesnt work in this manner but at least she can take a minute to solve our doubts and not only say doesn¬¥t work in this manner and she move her face to the computer.
10,"The positive: Great entertainment and great (but expensive) restaurants. Friendly and helpful housekeeping staff.    The negative: The rooms lobby and casino are all in desperate need of a facelift. Our room lacked soundproofing from noisy traffic (we were on the 36th floor). All elevators to the parking garage were out of service making it impossible for handicapped guests to navigate 3+ levels of stairs. We booked 2 nights online but upon arrival we were told we would have to change rooms/towers for the second night (required lengthy discussion with Front Desk manager to straighten that out). Paid $50/night resort fee which only covered limited internet access (2 devices - e.g. cell phones) according to staff. Additional device connections (e.g. laptops) are charged extra $15-$20/day. Parking is NOT covered in the resort fee - that's an additional $15-$20 per day! They even charge a minimum of $20 to check in before 3:00 PM. Consequently even the ""express"" check in process which we used was extremely time consuming and frustrating.    Summary: This was my first and last stay at this property. There are now many other modern upscale resorts on the Strip which include more amenities in their resort fees such as unlimited internet parking and resort credits."
10,I came to this hotel to attend a conference. I have never experienced such disappointing customer service in any 5 star hotel before. The guest services is clearly understaffed and do not solve many issues that I faced. Although I paid for parking my room key was not linked to parking payment which was done. That took approx 4 hours of waiting and several phonecalls with people either not solving the problem and one even hung up on my face. Then there was another problem with some parcels I needed to have collected. I was given in accurate information again regarding the location of collection and timing etc. and it took hours of waiting and useless calls to finally end up paying 60$ for receiving my packages. They call it a handling fee when they clearly don‚Äôt handle anything reasonably. Overall the attitude from the staff and their limited knowledge and ability to solve minor issues was a major set back. I will never be visiting this place again although it looks very nice but he experience ruined that.
10,I was booked into Caesars for 8 nights for a business trip. I had booked 20 rooms as part of a company meeting. Upon check in i was assigned a room which had medicinal packaging in the wardroobe and hair in the sink. Front desk refused to swap my room. After a lengthy argument they gave me a room that was so dirty you could smell the dust. I asksd fot non allergenic foam pillows and was told i was on a ‚Äúwaiting list. Really?!  They have outsourced their operator service as the people answering the calls has no idea how to deal with my requests and were clearly reading a script. This was also the case when i was due to check out - i called to ask her my total bill and she simply could not work it out. Having stayed at many hotels i know how the system works and i had to talk her through it step by step.    Anyway back to my story. On day 2 i developed an eye infection and fever. I let them know about this and could still not get me pillows. I finally bought some from Target and left them back as a gift.    On day 4 i was moved to a bigger room. I thought that my nightmare was over. That night while sitting on the lounge chair i found a tampon ! The mineral water bottle in the mini bar was half full‚Ä¶used ! There were various other plastic bits all over the floor.    The first 2 rooms were in the Julius tower where they assisgn rooms to th younger crowd who kept me awake from 2am - 3am with their alcohol infused singing shouting and screaming.    The 3 rd room was in the Palace tower. Queiter but once again i was nor able to sleep due to a lound himming noise from the aircon which was switched off !    My suggestion - NEVER STAY HERE ! I certainly will not.
30,I stayed at Caesars Palace. And I was so excited! I have stayed at other Caesars property. So this was not some one up thing. I have stayed at Paris and Flamingo's. And now the big house of Caesars. Upon check in. I was talked into an upgrade from the Forum towers to the Octavious tower. Ok. I really wanted my daughter to have a great experience. NOT! The top part of the mini bar had missing items. And . The room was dirty and the headboard was destroyed. I called and complained about the mini bar items( later had to fight to get them taken off). My room. The same. The room had torn curtains. The bathroom floor was not mopped. And I wiped my own room down with lysol wipes I brought. The ice bucket had a hair in it. And the carpet was old dirty. And my headboard and painting on the was were destroyed and peeling. I also called about that as well. The Octavious tower is a very long walk. I will not stay at Caesars in the future. You get nickeled and dimed for everything. I think I will try MGM properties next time. I paid way to much for this broke down palace.
10,Well let me start off by saying that it‚Äôs impossible to get help at reception. I needed assistance to clarify the over charges on my credit card and couldn‚Äôt get anyone to assist me. I called twice from the room to get a credit on an $89 bottle of wine that I purchased online before I arrived to the hotel. Once I received the summary of charges I noticed that they charged me twice for that bottle of Justin cab and some chocolates. Beware do not upgrade anything online. They are not willing to work with you to figure out where THEY made a mistake. Not only did they screw me with the wince charge but they also charged me for 4 items from the mini bar that I never touched. I don‚Äôt understand what type of customer they think I am but it‚Äôs not fair for them to completely ignore my issues and just charge me whatever the hell they feel like charging.
40,Machines getting tighter every year. Security was excellent. Who‚Äôs idea is it to not have a nonsmoking area that moron should be fired yesterday. Food prices going crazy 10 dollars slice of pizza. 10 dollar beers. Seven star lounge and diamond closed I guess too make way for dogs to roam property. Can‚Äôt take a property seriously with disregard for peoples health do to smoke screen. Caesar can kiss my ass in the future and will not recommend the hotel to anyone. But thanks for hospitality you tried.
20,We stayed in the Julius Tower and it was terrible. Run down rooms definitely not the standard of a 5 star hotel. At the check-in time we did not want to upgrade that was offered and we literally got verbally shamed by the reception person and as a result the first room we got was dirty had some brown cream on the sink and shower probably someone dyed their hair there and was not cleaned. Upon complaining to the front desk we got a lot of attitude and eventually we got upgraded to a suite room which was a bit better but still dirty and aged. The carpet was all stained and dirty lots of mold sink in the bathroom nightstands all dirty one of them even had some sort of dried mucus on the side. Also some weird brown stains on the room wall and the toilet paper holder was broken and kept falling. We stayed 5 nights and the room was cleaned extremely superficial. There were some crumbs on the floor that were never vacuumed. Everything there depends on the mood of the front desk and everyone expects a tip otherwise they don‚Äôt do their job at all. When asking for a late check out we got different answers from no can do we are all booked but in the next 5 minutes it was available when talking to a different person. Not a pleasant hotel stay at all left a very bitter taste we would never stay at Caesars again not worth the money at all.
50,The room assigned on Nov 29 2022 was in a very shabby condition. Katherine from front desk heard me out and helped me by talking about it with her manager Taja Nunez. Things turned 360 degrees from here where Taja was very professional courteous and extremely polite. Taja was very helpful and helped in resolving the issue. Such a pleasant experience dealing with her. Thank you Taja!!! You definitely deserved this appreciation.
20,The garbage in my room still had the previous guests trash. Items were missing from the minibar. There is a coffee machine but they charge you if you actually drink coffee. I called the front desk to tell her about the garbage and minibar but she didn‚Äôt try to fix anything but just told me that I should call after my stay if I get charged for the minibar items.  No offer to help with my bags at check in even though I paid for an upgrade.  Room service charged a $15 dollar delivery fee and suggests a full tip.  Twenty minutes before check out the housekeeping staff walked in my room while I was using the bathroom.
40,This is indeed an important hotel in Las Vegas history. One of the 'old' great resorts with an amazing exterior. I checked out of the hotel after two days and in general I left with a good impression.    Check in went smooth and the staff member seemed to know what he was doing. In these times decent staff is hard to find so I was very impressed. I was assigned a room in the palace tower and went on my way to find the room. And this is where the hotel is not doing great. Getting to the right elevator was a bit of a challenge. Unlike other hotels like Caesars there was no major pathway through the casino jungle and I had to ask for directions several times. It is just a bit annoying to have to deal with the confusion.    The room was really nice and seemed very up to date. Wonderful bathroom and plenty of space in what I believe was a premium room. Separate toilet from the shower tub and vanity area which makes it possible for couples to use the bathroom at the same time without challenges.    The food options are not impressive and I would hope for an upgrade to the food court. We were 8 people traveling together for business and we also had challenges finding a bar with seating possible for a small group like this.    I enjoyed my stay and I was pleasantly surprised with this grand dame of Las Vegas.
10,Phone out of order. luggage lost. Had to search for my self. nobody cares. Phone operator who hangs the phone on you. Front desk especially the so called managers are rude and repellant and even threatening. They are the biggest mess. Not willing to provide information regarding for example how phone or shower works. Room is good and spacy. If you are not strong in mind your stay will be a disaster. We‚Äôre trying to leave early. they can even have the remaining days we paid for for free. And that is what they want. Even for free you‚Äôll not be able to find me in the near this stress giving place anymore.
40,Easy check in process except the guy thought he was a magician. The room was alright quiet most of the time view was the top of a building and the housekeeping was fantastic. The sinks were broken the door frame was broken and only one chair for a 2 bed room. Casino was nice great location and enjoyed the stay. I‚Äôd go back but I would definitely ask for a different room.
10,Awful- a very big disappointment in every way- They charge for everything and they tried to double charge us and others for parking- we prepaid our parking ticket before getting to our cars and at the exit they would not recognize any of the receipts and said we had to pay again- obviously this is something they are not interested in fixing- only one elevator working - dirty room and peeling wallpaper in the common areas - they charge $15 for delivering food to your room plus 18% tip and they cask if you want to tip again I didn‚Äôt but still ended up with the cheapest sandwich and Diet Pepsi in the hotel at $66! If you order from  Your room and opt to go down to the restaurant to pick up your order they charge $1 plus tip for YOU going down to pick up  YOUR order!! No one winning in the casino for the 5 days we were there- the place is SO HUGE that even though we requested rooms near each other they gave us rooms that were 1/4 mile apart - the buffet is ridiculous at $80 per person not including tip-the sodas are $8-10 each never mind the liquor- people were coming back to hotel with bags full of drinks and snacks from CVS and Walgreens- it‚Äôs a money grabbing disgrace - they add on and add on charges and I ended up paying over $400 in extra charges for a dirty ugly room that had the view of a roof next door - oh‚Ä¶. For making coffee in  Your room it‚Äôs $12 to use the machine- of course the vending machines on the floors are not working - never again will we go there! Horrible and I‚Äôve been to other hotels in LV four other times and they weren‚Äôt like this!üò°
20,My recent hotel experience was poor and here's a short list of things that made the experience something I rather not re-experience.    1. The check-in process was horrible. The line was very long. About 20% into the line I learned there is an express check-in. I tried that too but that was a miserable experience. Instead of giving you a room it simply register you and will email you once a room becomes available. Furthermore there's a $20 fee for early check-in. I was only 2 hours ahead of the normal check-in at 4 pm. After waiting for 30 minutes standing with my luggage I spoke to a person at Front Desk and she helpfully found a room for me. BTW I did not receive the email for early check-in until 5:11 pm or more than 1 hour after the normal check-in.    2. The elevators often break. Of the five elevator in the tower that I was staying three broke at one point requiring a wait of nearly 15 minutes. (BTW there's no stair case that I could find too.) One time I got in the elevator it shook and refused to go up or down. In short the elevators were unpredictable.    3. In the room the electric outline on the desk was exposed - I mean there's no cover. This was such a hazard that I reported immediately. Thankfully the mechanics came after a few hours and fixed it. Also there was 4 USB ports and only 1 worked.    4. And the fitness center is only open from 6 am to 6 pm in a major hotel. By the time I was done with my meetings I have less than 50 minutes at the center. And the morning congestion was very bad partly because 5 out of maybe a dozen treadmills did not work. About 40% of the bikes was also defective.    5. The electronic services that one can normally access from the television does not work too. On late check out for example the tv screen directed me to an email. I still have yet to receive a response. The same with check out; the TV directs me to a URL and that URL redirects to the main hotel site. At least the email sent about the check out worked saving me the agony of getting on another line.    That said I realize it's an older hotel and the staff were friendly. But the next time I visit Las Vegas I will stay elsewhere.
50,I had some major room issues my first day and was beyond upset! Christina was wonderful empathetic and took my issues to heart and worked with her manager to get things right again! She also checked out everyone in our group and our checkout process was seamless! She is a true asset to your company and should be recognized as your best employee! Thank you Christina!
30,I understand that perhaps the Forum Tower rooms may be the last to get updated but they are certainly in need. At least my Petit Suite was. Overall it‚Äôs a nice and spacious room separate bedroom with a sitting area plus a living room with powder room. So many things that have been neglected in the room start to annoy you and I was there for 6 nights. Even the elevators in the Forum Tower were having issues. 2 are dedicated to the Penthouse Suites so that leaves 4 for all of the other rooms. During my entire stay 2 of those remaining ones weren‚Äôt working properly leaving just 2 elevators for the entire tower.  Not trying to focus on the negative just that unfortunately is what leaves a large impression when you are paying for major room upgrade. I would stay at Caesar‚Äôs again just in a different wing. I loved the shopping but wish they had more dining available. Of the quick service places in their ‚Äòfood court‚Äô only half of those were open. I guess they can‚Äôt get the restaurants or workers to re-open the others?  Also things still listed on their website that are included with the suite are no longer available. There isn‚Äôt an in-room coffee maker and you can‚Äôt actually store any of your own items in the mini fridge it‚Äôs just for their drinks that are for sale.
10,I paid for a kind bed was ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù to a two queen room. When I got to the room and noticed I called down. The girl said there wasn‚Äôt a king available. Except there was because the man who checked us in was trying to get us to pay extra for it. It‚Äôs not our fault they overbook. The bathroom was locked when we came into the room. The girl laughed on the phone and said she‚Äôd send someone. We managed to get it open before anyone showed up. When we checked in we were in a hurry to get ready and go out so we didn‚Äôt notice that the bathroom floor was filthy!!! It was so nasty!! Looked like someone barfed all over it and it wasn‚Äôt cleaned!! Told the front desk. They just apologized. But did nothing. Don‚Äôt stay here!!
50,Excellent experience and service. We stayed for two nights in the Palace Towers on the 21st floor. The room was large and seemed upgraded from reservation. Only quarrel was the water for showers were consistently cold and took >20min to warm. Also it would be nice to have a microwave and personal fridge besides the bar. Would stay again. Thank you!
50,Overall the Hotel is stunning lots of entertainment options to choose from.    The rooms could use an occasional thorough cleaning especially the bathroom ac vents and carpets.    Customer Service: Check-in process was Amazing and staff was courteous. Housekeeping Maintenance and the Luggage storage staff were Wonderful.    I UNFORTUNATELY can't say the same about the Check-out process with Joceline. Her unprofessionalism towards the guests checking out was overall RUDE. Her facial expression was of someone who hates providing customer service no smile to acknowledge the guests her tone in her responses was condescending barking orders to guests to move to kiosks and lastly not even a thank you. This is not someone Caesars Palace needs representing their Hotel. Send her for training or get her out of that role.
30,Dated boring rooms with upcharges everywhere.    Premium King Room was beat up lots of nicks scratches and stains. Windows were actual mirrors with just a sliver of light from the outside world. Felt like a coffin and I was slowly dying. Couldn't even use the coffee maker to help without having to buy kcups from the inroom mini bar.
40,The room was very nice especially the bathroom.  The bed was comfortable and linen was soft. I did not smell Marijuana in the hallways. It was a very nice stay.  I would have given them 5 stars but I didn't like how far self parking and the registration desk was from the rooms.
20,I did not have the best experience here. I would not recommend this place for someone who is not ready to spend a ridiculous amount of money for a mediocre experience.  During our stay it seems like they were having a sewage issue. There was a foul smell from the lobby to the hallway. Everyone there seemed ok with that and nothing was done to make it less pungent.  DO NOT USE THE MINI FIRDGE. They charge a 75$ restocking fee for using the fridge. We wanted to store some dairy product and some medicine that needed to be refrigerated so to make space we removed some of the item in there to store our product. Turns out there is a sensor that will tally everything removed from the fridge. Be prepared for a nice surprise when checking out if you do use it. There are a lot of hidden fees. So make sure to read everything they charge for.  Do not eat in the hotel. The food at the buffet was terrible. If you are from a city that has good food do not go there and expect the same. The quantity and quality of food was subpar. I would recommend taking the time to go out of the strip to eat. It is better quality and cheaper.  I did not receive the experience expected from a hotel of that stature.
10,No one answers the phone .  Automated systems inadequate.  If you do talk to anyone they‚Äôre rude and / or unwilling to help.  There is nothing to say of a positive nature so we will be avoiding this hotel in future .  We can‚Äôt comment on room service as this is automated as well .
10,Vegas has gone down hill. If your looking to get taken advantage of and scammed this is the place to go. Things used to be alot different. Bring back vegas in the 90s! After this last experience with incorrect billing to my credit I wont be returning.
20,I had 8 rooms and 4 of them had incorrect billing. When I checked in at the diamond lounge the hostess did not change my card to silver so I did not get $100 credit at GuySavoy. We had no hot water for 2 days. The fitness center roof leaked. The amenities were lacking. No robes. no makeup mirrors no conditioner or any of the other expected amenities. You cannot reach a manager!! We have been at Caesars for 46 years but no more!! It is no longer a luxury hotel
30,We were there for 4 days and the whole time we were there one elevator was broken. The door was left open with a cone inside the elevator door and the buzzer continued to beep non stop 24 hours a day. Couldn't they have atleast closed the door and turned off the buzzer? These places make alot of money and the upkeep on the place was not good. The elevators were very dark and the drop ceilings and moldening was broken off. Then i get a bill for the mini bar in my room that I never used. They will get a call and a refund of $12.99 for a beer I didnt drink.
50,My husband & I stayed at Caesar‚Äôs Palace Las Vegas in an Augustus Tower Fountain View Room for 5 nights around the first week in November 2022. From the 7-Star VIP check in with Shayan Maher to the restaurants the services were excellent! In particular I want to note that when we checked in I needed to sign something so I sat down my CPAP machine case & inadvertently forgot to pick it back up before going to the room. We went back down to check out the property eat & gamble a bit before heading back up to go to bed. Once returning to our room I realized I didn‚Äôt have my CPAP machine. I rushed back downstairs to VIP check in (Shayan had already left for the night) & was told it wasn‚Äôt there but might have been turned into Security. The girl at the desk called Security who said it hadn‚Äôt been turned in. We went back up to the room in hopes it would be turned in overnight. The next morning I checked back with VIP check in who called Security again but was told they still didn‚Äôt have it & I would need to fill out a lost item report (I had done that online before going to bed). My husband & I decided to walk to the Security desk. Once there the guard tried to look up my CPAP in his list on the computer as well as the report I filled online but found neither. At that moment my husband noticed my CPAP bag on a shelf behind the guard & we were finally able to retrieve it (neither had been entered into the system yet & the guard didn‚Äôt think to look elsewhere for it). We were just relieved to get it back! We dropped back by VIP services/check in to let them know it was at the security desk after all (so we were all good) & to get some misc. recommendations & ask a few questions about our benefits for our trip. Shayan Meyer was back on duty & was the nicest guy! He cheerfully took the time to explain our VIP Trip benefits amongst other things. The rest of our stay if we needed anything we would hope Shayan would be on duty when we went in. He always remembered our names & never once seemed bothered by our questions or requests. If you don‚Äôt mind a huge place & possibly getting lost a time or two before you get used to the property I highly recommend Caesar‚Äôs Palace & the Augustus Tower‚Äôs Fountain rooms. The view at night of the strip & Bellagio‚Äôs Fountain show was amazing! And don‚Äôt forget to ask for Shayan Maher; he showed the absolute BEST service we‚Äôve experienced anywhere!
40,"Dwayne on the front desk was exceptional with our arrival and check in. He welcomed us and apologized for the short delay in the line. He shared small talk and went above and beyond to assist us with a room request. His enthusiasm pride in brand and willingness to deliver a memorable guest experience was exceptional from beginning to end.  We witnessed Michael a 25 year banquet server going above and beyond to deliver memorable moments with many guests including ourselves. He smiles helped guests carry items opened doors cleared plates and was attentive to every unexpressed need. He engaged in casual small talk all with a smile and exuding pride in working for Caesars. When we complimented his levels of experiential service he humbly said it wasn't only him but the entire Caesars team.  Sadly the last touchpoint ruined our overall guest experience. After standing in line Karen stared at me (with no smile) as I approached the desk. I explained I tried the self check out kiosk but it wasn't working. She said it doesn't work after 10:00am. I suggested they should post a sign advising such she said 'ya I guess'. (No apology) I advised I'd like to check out and needed a receipt. She only responded to my questions with no small talk. She printed the receipt handed it to me and said; 'Enjoy your stay with us."". Really? We had just checked out. Last words spoken are the first words we think of when we think of your brand. Karen neglected to ask about our stay share any small talk and offered no invitation to return or wish us safe travels home. Your only as strong as your weakest link."
10,The Forum Tower is terrible. Elevators were broken floor tiles cracked lamp shade had burn marks furniture was dated and carpet was old and stale. The lamps were dusty. Ivy text service never brought my hangers. This area is in desperate need of renovation.
10,Caesars was definitely a disappointment. First off the ironing board broke when we opened it and the makeup mirror light didn‚Äôt work (bathroom lighting isn‚Äôt good). Got disconnected twice when trying to reach guest services for replacements. The ironing board was replaced but not the makeup mirror. Then water started coming up out of the sink when no one was using it. Maintenance said that the drain is connected to the next room and fixed it although the whole trip we heard water gurgling when we could hear people in their bathroom. There was trash in the hall and the elevators went from one being broken when we checked in to only two working by day 4 which resulted in long lines and extra packed elevators. Then I used the email checkout link to schedule a checkout time. I chose noon but it didn‚Äôt say if there would be a late check out fee so I called guest services right away. The guy said to call back around 11 to make sure I wouldn‚Äôt be charged because it wasn‚Äôt showing a charge then so I called back at 10:30 and the woman said it didn‚Äôt show I used the online link and so we had to leave at 11 because there was no late check out available by then and said the email link doesn‚Äôt work. I travel often personally and more often for work and this was the worst experience I‚Äôve had in a long time.
10,The service was pretty bad. Our hair dryer was not working. We called the front desk and they said they would give us a new one as soon as possible. However we waited for 40 minutes and no one came. We called them again; they told us someone was on The way. Unfortunately no one was coming until the following day we saw a hair dryer in front of our door. Really taking forever.  The buffet SUCKS! Not worth the price at all.
50,Check inn Perfecto con Darleen. R√°pido y eficiente. Muy buen trato.    Excellent service provide by Darlene at Diamond front desk. The hotel services are great and restaurants are amazing.    Crowed with visitors having so much fun at the hotels casino. Good quality drinks at the tables to make feel comfortable.
10,We booked connecting rooms called to arrange and had to get 2 Suites to make this possible. Check in as front desk if they are connecting‚Ä¶.they are not have to go back to front desk wait 2 hrs to get our room‚Ä¶..no offer of directions or bellman‚Ä¶50.00 extra to check in an hour early‚Ä¶..not known until you have stood in line for 45 minutes‚Ä¶.no coffee in room 20.00 for 4 Kurig Pods can‚Äôt purchase water and place in fridge or they charge you for using the fridge in your own room. The pronto coffee shop food is terrible and slow. I would not recommend this hotel rooms are just ok nothing luxurious.
30,Booked for 4 days 3 nights in the Julius Deluxe Room with 1 King Bed. Once we got into the room we noticed everything is quite dusty. Bathroom is stocked well for the number of days we booked. Tables bathroom floor and bedroom carpet need some thorough clean. Don't even look behind the Fridge console table there are a lot of junk left from previous occupants. We didn't get any housekeeping for any of the days even when we asked the staff outside on the hall. We called the front reception and they offered to come by but it was already late at night which we declined. Most of the staffs are really nice which we really appreciate. Resort fee is still present which we think should includes some basic housekeeping but atleast we got wifi.
20,Caesars Palace was once thought to be the premier casino in Las Vegas. My recommendation is to book elsewhere. Charged for early check in which was more than the resort fee for the day room was ready but was only 3:00 instead of 4:00. Rooms are very dated can only adjust thermostat a few degrees each way. Just wasn‚Äôt a good experience. They won‚Äôt get my business again.
50,Caesars Palace is a great place to stay in the middle of everything. I really like the location and everything that they have available here. The staff here is very accommodating and works hard to make sure that you have everything that you need.
10,We head to Vegas at a min 3 times a year and for the past 7 years have stayed at the Aria almost every time. This time our friend was given a free room at Caesar‚Äôs and so we all decided to stay there‚Ä¶never again!    It's worth it to note that rate was not anything spectacular in fact it was pricier than other resorts including the Aria. To begin when you walk in you are greeted with the indistinguishable smell of smoke. To be fair we knew this going into it. We always knew that Caesers was one of the smokier casinos we just didn‚Äôt think how negatively it would affect us when headed to bed and waking up to it. Instead of the smell of a nice freshly brewed coffee you are greeted with the smell of stale smoke. Caesar‚Äôs is an old property and no matter how many new walls or carpets are put in the ceilings are low and the air ventilation is terrible it will always smell like smoke. To gamble there for a few hours is not an issue but to sleep there is an issue for me.    We did mobile check-in paid the $45 to get an early check-in and our room was ready by noon. Went to the kiosk for the ease of getting our keys but shockingly it wasn‚Äôt easy. The kiosk wouldn‚Äôt read our phone or scan our QR codes and there was no one in sight to assist us. After a while we managed to get it to read our credit card and finally got our key. This however did beat our friends 30 min wait in the VIP area to get his key. Yes 30 min they must really care about their VIPs.    We stayed in the Julius tower 10th floor. We had friends in the Palace and friends in the Augustus (the comped room). Steer clear of Julius and the Palace towers.    Upon entering the room there was a used straw on the floor gross! I never picked it up I scooted it by the desk I didn‚Äôt need to touch someone else‚Äôs straw. We had our room serviced and even after the room was cleaned it was still there. There was mold growing in the shower and the ceiling was peeling so bad that I thought Alan from the Hangover was going to fall through at any minute. The stall shower was so incredibly small that it could barely fit one person lucky we are small otherwise that shower wouldn‚Äôt work! The sink didn‚Äôt drain and had room for half of a toothbrush on the counter. The lighting was terrible it was as if they were afraid to brighten the room for fear of what we might see. The towels were similar to the sandpaper that I used last week to smooth out some new shelves in my dining room and there wasn‚Äôt a bottle of water to be found.    I have major neck & back issues and need a few pillows to rest at night. Once in the room I requested (2) pillows to be sent up and was told ‚Äúthere is a pillow shortage and we can not fill your request‚Äù. Oddly enough our friend who was comped his room requested the same thing and had additional pillows sent to his room within minutes. I guess the shortage was just for guest that paid for their rooms. I was however offered additional sheets in place of pillows hmm? Not sure how pillows correlate to sheets but who am I to wonder?! I continued to ask for the pillows considering that the hotel has 3396 rooms within 6 towers and I found it very disconcerting that there weren‚Äôt 2 pillows anywhere! Or maybe they just have the worst customer service ever?!! Surprise I never got pillows but somehow managed to fall asleep. When I woke up it looked like Caesar himself sucker punched me in the face and I felt as if he was squeezing my chest so tight that I couldn‚Äôt breathe. Spoiler alert it wasn‚Äôt Caesar but it was the feather pillows that I was forced to sleep with. I am highly allergic to feathers and can not sleep with any down pillows or comforters. When I finally could speak again I called down AGAIN about the pillows and when the lovely very helpful (I Joke) when the nasty person on the line told me it didn‚Äôt matter that I couldn‚Äôt breathe they couldn‚Äôt change out my pillows nor send up Benadryl but could put me in touch with someone for medical help I about jumped out of the window. Imagine staying at a hotel with 3396 rooms having a full-blown asthma attack because there are feather pillows and the staff tells you ‚Äúsorry we can‚Äôt do anything‚Äù. I finally got some sort of manager on the phone who said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see what I can do‚Äù and eventually I had (2) nonfeather pillows not the amount I requested of course.    At the end of the night good luck trying to find a bottle of water or anything open to buy a bottle of water before bed! The bars won‚Äôt give you one and we couldn‚Äôt find anything open anywhere near the elevator bays to get water! We didn't want to risk hiking somewhere else to find another store not open. Seriously Caesers do better if you won‚Äôt have anything in place then at least have them in the room.    We spent a lot of our time at the Vista bar and had the same server both days she was amazing and said she would have gone to the store to buy me pillows. Hey Caesers maybe you should give her a raise! Overall the entire staff at the Vista was friendly and great. The gal at the coffee kiosk on the way out also was a breath of fresh air friendly funny and happy as was our valet who got our cab to the airport.    Other than those people I have nothing nice to say about anyone else. And I have nothing nice to say about my stay there sadly. What I will say is this Caesars is old and lacks customer service to make it a decent place. It‚Äôs Circus Circus with some make up spanks and high heels on‚Ä¶.lots of things look great from a distance when you get up close it‚Äôs a whole new view! Take my word for it save your money and get a different view!!
50,Beautiful room in the Palace Tower. Bed very comfortable his and hers sinks were great and the spa bathtub amazing.  Good location to access the swimming pool and our wedding venue Juno Gardens.  Facilities within Caesars are great and staff always helpful. Kindly upgraded us because it was our wedding stay and assisted with queries at all times.
40,We stayed at Caesar‚Äôs for the weekend before Thanksgiving and really enjoyed it. We had a standard room in the Forum Tower.    The room was spacious with a desk area very comfortable lounge chair and a sofa. Drawers are at a premium but there was sufficient closet space. The bathroom had just a shower one sink and a separate commode room. There were plenty of plugs for devices and night stands on each side. While nice the room was a little tired preventing a rating of 5 stars. Carpet needed cleaning sink drained very slowly chairs a little old.    Wi-Fi speeds were a little below 10/10 (no I didn‚Äôt leave off a zero) but I was able to stream YouTube TV with minimal difficulties.    The fitness center is quite nice with plentiful cardio and weight machines. Much better fitness center than lower priced hotels like NYNY and on par with Venetian. Travelers should be aware that the Resort Fee only covers two people per room for the fitness center and that‚Äôs a needless money grab. (On the bright side the sign in sheet doesn‚Äôt even include room number so I don‚Äôt know if that policy is enforced.)    The casino is massive and there‚Äôs no need to go anywhere else. The Sportsbook is not quite as good as Mirage or Circa but it‚Äôs pretty nice. Just be aware that like the other high end hotels you have to pay to sit and watch the NFL on Sunday. I always head to Excalibur or Luxor where seating is still free.    Retail shops abound both in the hotel itself and in the Forum Shops which is the mall connected to the hotel. We did not eat at Caesar‚Äôs but there are many many choices.    Overall Caesar‚Äôs to me is a low end high end hotel. Not quite Venetian Wynn or Encore but certainly nicer than Mirage NYNY or Paris. If you can get a ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù rate it‚Äôs a good choice but otherwise you might be better off saving money and stepping down just a little.
20,Can‚Äôt use the cold empty portion mini fridge at all unless you pay to unlock it no free room coffee or tea a single tiny bar of soap for hands and shower (so must break in half) cord to phone failed once but speaker phone worked vacuuming at 11:30 pm in adjacent room (bc hey- they‚Äôve got 24 hr service) four interruptions on departure day from housekeeping event though I had entered my departure time on their system. Good security getting into room areas- and nice wall art. Won‚Äôt stay there again.
30,We were so excited coming back to Las Vegas after 6 years away. It was supposed to be very special for our 22nd wedding anniversary especially as we had to cancel our 2020  Trip due to COViD.  I am very disappointed. Caesars has lost its focus on guest services every day is a struggle to get your room cleaned today I have phoned three times and waited 4.5 hours. WiFi is limited to 2 devices and no free WiFi in the casino areas (all the other hotels have free WiFi).  Frankly what was once a great hotel has gone downhill and for my wedding anniversary and returning here after a few years I am very disappointed.  I love Vegas and I love the vibe but I will never stay at Caesar‚Äôs Palace again. And suggest that before you pay $450 per night for bed only you also look at other options which are better value and value customer and guest services.
20,A few things are really very disappointing:  -you have to pay extra 39$ to check in early before 4 pm. Their ‚Äúnormal ‚Äú check in is after 4 pm.  -they don‚Äôt provide room service every day though I asked the front desk to clean and change daily till otherwise notified.  -charged me using mini- bar though I did not use anything. It‚Äôs counting of items is based on anything moved temporarily such as a fell out soda will be charged even though you put it back. customers bear the burden to prove it‚Äôs not consumed.
30,You can tell Ceaser‚Äôs Palace is an olde hotel. Although our experience was generally positive there were clear areas needing improvement. First was the feeling like we were being nickled and dimed. Our refrigerator was not for our use they‚Äôd stocked it with booze and snack that could be removed without a charge and a $75 charge would be applied if we wanted to use it for personal use storing leftovers or other items we‚Äôd want refrigerated. Shame on them. Not just in our room everything seems massively overpriced. Also the room had no robe or slippers that would have been a nice touch. The towel hook in the bathroom was broken/missing as was one of the drawer handles on the nightstand. Finally although our room was non smoking the hotel smelled on cigarettes which I guess I should expect from Vegas and it was worse at Treasure Island was still a negative factor regarding Ceaser‚Äôs. I usually stay at Mandalay Bay or the Bellagio and would definitely recommend them over Ceaser‚Äôs Palace.
30,Opulent but so Smokey and feeling run down. Manipulative layout that forces you to go through the casino wherever you go. No windows. If you‚Äôre not going to gamble they clearly don‚Äôt care about you. Nickel and dime you at ever turn - early checkin? $50. Every drink $20. Not worth the price. Head to the Winn or Aria for a real hotel. This is just a money grab
10,700$ a night for crapy room.. not even a complementary water ???? Room filled with snacks and beverages but if you dare touch it 20$ billed . Need an extra hour 55$ ‚Ä¶ go downstairs and buy a bottle water 8$ .. crapy coffee 6$ . Your not allowed to sit anywhere even tho all the bars are empty unless you pay 15$ for a rum and coke ‚Ä¶ all there games have the worst odds nobody winning .. triple zero on there roulette wheels ‚Ä¶ 125$ Minimum to sit in there sportsbook even tho I wagered hundreds ‚Ä¶ the Raiders are at home this weekend so let‚Äôs jack up the prices on all the dumb football tourists !!! Is the new motto ‚Ä¶. Vegas is so overrated its a chitty town where all they want to do is take advantage of all the tourist and gouge every penny from you ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ what a joke
40,Was very apprehensive before we arrived as saw some terrible reviews on here about the Augustus tower but really had very positive experience.  We stayed on 26th floor of Augustus. View was brilliant. Wonderful bed and room very clean . Curtains looked new but carpet was not new but fine very clean. Maids were very helpful if asked for anything extra. Bathroom was excellent. Lovely large jacuzzi bath which worked fine. Nice large shower . Jack and Jill sinks and separate door for toilet.  Room was large and had settees . Plenty of cupboard space and drawers.  Windows did need a clean when sun shone on them but probably a thankless task as you are surrounded by desert.  My only criticism is no tea and coffee facility in the room.  Would highly recommend. Our stay was great.
10,When checking in used my credit card for incidentals - the check in person shared by info to a Caesar‚Äôs employee $500 in 2 Caesar‚Äôs locations .a sheriff friend of mine called and told an inside job. When I called in to Caesar‚Äôs i was told I charged a meal for and treated so bad I asked for a manager
20,"I typically have a great time in Vegas as I go for conferences or sporting events every year or two. I have stayed in Caesars previously and don't remember all the additional charges.    It started at check in. Flight arriving before 4PM? that would be an extra $55 fee want to check out after 12PM that's an additional fee. Want to use the fridge in the room? that's a $75 fee bottle of water $10 fee.    The absolute worst fee is internet. The room in the forum tower received poor internet and seemed to block my phone cellular signal so I had to log on to get internet access. You get two devices per room before Caesars charges an additional $14.95 per additional device. Spouse and I had to log on to cell phones so we could communicate if we split up in the resort and I was out of free devices that I could access. Couldn't log on with laptop no kindle no iPad etc.    Room was acceptable (and we had issues with air vent completely covered in dust no remote for TV phone didn't work and drain in shower was slow) conference was good not worth going back to Caesars with the 1200 person conference at any point in the future and I will do everything to ensure it doesn't go back.    Check out was tiring. Waited roughly 30 minutes to check out after trying the kiosk and online. Attendants seemed annoyed as the first question to everyone was did you try to check out online? Everyone I heard answered ""Yes"". If 30 people in front of me at 11AM had issues I'm sure they had hundreds that tried and failed that day alone. The technology has clearly failed."
50,Awesome hotel & even better staff - Dwayne was extremely nice very accommodating and provided quick & efficient service! One of the best hotel staff I have had. Would definitely stay again for the ambience and service.
20,"Like most of Las Vegas Caesars Palace is starting to show its age. It is still a HUGE property but that can be a tremendous down side.    Initially I found a great rate on hotels for the November weekend we would be in Las Vegas. We booked it (including the first night prepaid) and thought we were all set. When we got into Caesars there was no early check-in for our style room that would not be available for five more hours but lo and behold there was a room available for an upcharge + upgraded resort fee (what is this - it is not a resort?) per night. We went for the upgrade - so we could get checked in and have a few hours of sleep before the evening - but I still feel like we were ripped off.    The room was a good size and the bathroom was huge but it was just more than we needed or wanted. Much of the furniture is worn and the carpet could stand to be replaced but that is true for so many hotel rooms that it was not surprising.    As far as restaurants there are a plethora and many are still marked 24/7 though that is incorrect. There is only one place - Caffe Americano near the check-in desk - that is open for a hot breakfast and it does not open early and they are very surly. I cannot recommend.    On top of everything else we did not realize that Caesars allows and practically encourages smoking. Truly everything in the place - even if you are up at o'dark thirty - smells like smoke. It was a real shock especially when we were in and around other hotel properties during our stay that were smoke-free.    This is our first and our last time to stay at Caesars. It was an ""experience"" as they say but I would not list it is a good experience."
50,My wife and I checked into Caesar's for one night. We checked in at the Diamond Registration Desk and were greeted by Darlene. She was extremely helpful polite and provided us an upgrade to our reservation- The Augustus Suite. This room was so huge and beautiful. It had a terrific view of the Bellagio and water show. Three bathrooms and a giant Dining Table. Drop Jaw room- thanks so much Darlene for making our stay EXTREMELY PLEASANT!
40,Stayed with my wife for the weekend hotel staffs friendly and room is very clean and there‚Äôs a lot of good foods but a little pricey overall love the rooms and very clean!!!Will try other hotels but coming back for sure
30,This place is beautiful. The rooms are gorgeous and the decorations are phenomenal. The prices are horrifying. The food used to be reasonable in Vegas but it was an average of 40 dollars for breakfast and lunch per person per meal. Dinner was all over the place. I've been to Vegas about a dozen times. I've stayed here Palazzo Venetian Circus Circus TI and a couple others. Yes the nicer casino hotels are a bit more but this was insane. The breakfast buffet was 300 dollars for 4 people. That's crazy to me.
50,VIP Check In Darlene at the 7 Star Check in was Fantastic super friendly and very helpful with all of my questions she was fast and knowledgeable and helped with all of my requests and accommodations.
50,We had such a great time in Caesars. I learned how to play craps from some amazing dealers. Sal Robert Pop Eddie and Geno were absolutely amazing. They were so supportive encouraging and just honestly amazing. They made the trip and I would honestly come back just to see them. The hotel is beautiful as always. We also got to stay in a suite for a night cause our rooms weren't ready which was amazing cause we will never be able to do that again. üòÇ Thank you to all the people that made everything amazing. Also if Geno ever sees this I'm sorry I couldn't get a picture with you. You guys rock!
50,Dwayne at the front desk is a rock star and made my stay extra special with his amazing customer service!    The hotel is so fun and full of action. it‚Äôs in walking distance to so much that Vegas has to offer. I‚Äôll be back!
10,I can not believe that when i showed them the water in my room was black the manager did not even offer to change my room. I could not shower for two days because i was afraid of the water. Thank God it was a short trip but it was ruined by the water issue.
40,We stayed here in late 2021 for the AWS Conference. We have never stayed at Caesar‚Äôs before and there was absolutely nothing wrong with our room but it was a little dated and not as nice as we would have expected. It also took a long time to check in and I was disappointed that the pool was closed while we were there and there was nowhere (literally nowhere) to fill up a water bottle at the resort. We ended up having to go to the gym and take some mini water bottles which are good for about a sip of water.
30,I just have say that I was very thankful for the upgrade. I was upgraded to a handicap room. the only thing was that the bed was very tall for handicap people. when I call to ask for help the women name Angie was very rude üòí. I was very disappointed because I pay very good money for my room. I just feel that no handicap person should go through this.
50,First time staying in the center of the strip and I chose Caesars was very happy to be moved to the Nobu tower amazing rooms service and the benefit of a smaller tower fast elevator direct to the correct floor and much more.
20,Multiple trips this year service and amenities continue to decline. I am now 7 Stars which isn‚Äôt special in any way outside of casino offers. The ‚Äúlounge‚Äù is a big smack in the face for your high rollers    First few trips this year I got room I requested upgrade once but now get placed in some other type of room with a completely different or no view. Staff seems to make up new rules regarding room type each time. Rooms are really hit or miss seem to get the worse rooms the later you show up. There were a few really helpful VIP check in people in previous times haven‚Äôt seen familiar faces on recent trips. Even my host is gone now favorite bartenders gone. Can no longer ask to many questions at check in often get confused faces and told to go to rewards desk across the hotel. Happy to hand you this trip-advisor card though. Awkward encounters with tired eyed staff throughout the gigantic property. Paris and Wynn will be my go to now. This empire has fallen
30,"Stayed for 2 nights in town for a wedding. We were in a ""suite"" with a bedroom with a king bed and a sofa bed for third guest.  The sofa bed frame was broken. The mattress was just coils and a cover no padding at all. We looked at the tag it was made in 2007. There was a stain in one corner. And there was no bedding on it.  We called for a roll away bed 3 hours later it hadn't arrived. Had to go down to speak with the concierge to get someone to bring it up. Mattress not much better just coils and a cover really but at least it wasn't broken.  Only 2 devices per room can connect to the WiFi for free they charge $14.99 a day for each device after that. I‚Äôve stayed in lots of hotels none have done that. And don‚Äôt touch anything near or in the minibar. After 45 seconds you are charged even if your don‚Äôt open it. Check your room charges.  Next time I think an AirBnB near the strip."
20,Hi problem customer service from reception and out to charge ridiculous $$ at every turn! For example there is a coffee pot and cups in the room- but to get coffee you have to pay $22 for a k-cup!!! A bottled water was $11. They also messed up our invoice and charged for items from the minibar which we never even opened. A nightmare to get that corrected as well.
40,I was at a seminar here and arrived late at night (note - will never take the shuttle from the airport again it took 40 minutes and I swear we passed the same intersection at least 4 times). I was greeted by very friendly staff and was given a free upgrade to a minisuite in the Julius Tower. The only problem was finding the Julius Tower as they have NO MAPS! Seriously this place is huge and I got so lost over the next few days that I got a lot more exercise than I had planned. The room was very nice with relaxing sitting area comfortable bed and huge clean bathroom. The convention center was also good well organized and very large. Fortunately the seminar provided most of my meals as food here in the restaurants is very expensive. I have to say that every time I interacted with an employee they were very polite and helpful.
10,Save your money. Spent $600 for one night. but it‚Äôs not worth $600. There are nicer hotels on the Strip for less. They charge you for internet (there‚Äôs little to no service in the room) and it‚Äôs 75 dollars just to use the fridge. Used the main washroom twice. The first time there was used gitch on the floor and then a towel covered in pee. My money got stuck in the VLT and no one came to help. Went to talk to staff twice and they directed me to press the service button but no one ever showed up. Skip this hotel.
40,Stayed end of May 2022. Lots of options to eat but it is a massive hotel so be prepared to walk. There were a lot of pools to pick from but none of them were very large and some you had to pay to go into to. Drinks are expensive but we expected that. $27 - 30 for a 16oz alcoholic drink at the pool! They did check my pool bag but nothing too invasive so it is possible to sneak a couple shooters in your bag ( maybe put them in a small bag that isn't see through)  Checkin was not as easy as I thought - we did the express check-in (which still had a line) and every computer seemed to have problems taking your confirmation # or your scanning your license etc).  We got to the hotel at 10:45am and after the checking in process checked our bags at the Valet and went to the pool. We go a text when our room was ready - which wasn't until 4pm.  Hotel is in the middle of the strip to you can walk either direction for extra things to do.
40,Very enjoyable stay in LV location of accommodation is perfect however there where a few short comings no gratis bottled water no way of making hot drinks without spending $21 on coffee pods and the resort fee wasnt reflective of the services it was supposed to fund.  Clean and tidy room but a bit tired and dated ready for a refurb. Easy to navigate around the hotel with good clear signage. Helpful staff with a slick check-in process.  Very helpful and informative concerige team.  All in all it was a pleasant and eye opening experience we will be back. üòé
40,Stayed in Octavius tower large room with jacuzzi tub and separate shower great view of pools liked better than strip view. Automated check in and out OK missing human touch. If you want to call for front desk etc. They try to get you to use internet first. Trying to get to a fully automated experience so no one interacts with you regarding your stay. Had it's ups and downs. Everything overpriced $10 for water. But it's Caesars in Vegas.
30,I just completed my stay at Caesars. Well it was perfectly fine stay the check in and check out process was quick and easy. We were upgraded for a fair price to a 2 bath 2 bed room in the newly renovated tower. I believe it was the Palace Tower. It was a nice room however wasn't cleaned incredibly well. Lost of dust pile up on the lamps and shades. The curtains were nasty and felt grimy touching them. On the last night there after a shower I noted a leak on the on ceiling. I believe it was a pipe leading to the shower because once I turned off the show the leak slowed and stopped. but still sucks to see that at such iconic location. The Casino portion of the property is fantastic one of the best on the strip and the convivence of location is what you're paying for here. but to be honest if it wasn't for the great deal we got when booking. I would have booked elsewhere. And When I do return to Vegas I will look to book at one of the newer Resorts.
30,We had been staying away from the strip in a lovely hotel but I decided to splash out and have our last night at this iconic hotel. The check in takes ages parking is extra all the public areas are filled with gawping tourists in shorts and sneakers. The room was ok but showed signs of bumps and scrapes that decent maintenance should have sorted out. The jacuzzi bath didn't work. At over $600 it just wasn't worth it. Won't go again
10,Did not see parking fees anywhere on my reservation then was charged $18 per day! Rooms in desperate need of renovations!!! Can‚Äôt use the refrigerator because they want to stock it and sell you what‚Äôs inside. So much for leftovers!
10,Wow has this place gone down hill. Staying in a room in the Forum Tower. What a dump. Furniture looks like it has been beaten up with a hammer. Carpet is threadbare and worn. I am afraid to sit on the couch or sleep in the bed. So so bad especially for over $300/night. Pretty sure I could have gotten a better room for less money across the street at Bally‚Äôs and they are tearing that place down. Caesars‚Ä¶you should be ashamed‚Ä¶you used to set the standard‚Ä¶
40,The directional signage could be more helpful. Since we flew into Las Vegas we needed ride share to assist in getting around. Due to a mini grand prix event at the hotel the ride share pickup was 180 degrees across the hotel from where the driver knew to pick up the fare and a long walk for the patrons. A total fiasco missed rides cancelled rides flared tempers you name it. The hotel could have done a better job by placing signage redirecting patrons where the pick-up was. Total disfunction and lack of customer service.
10,I never write reviews but given my recent experience I feel a need to empower others on what to be aware of.    I stayed for 5 days at Caesars and the first day the internet and water went out. I was able to get internet restored after speaking with IT support and the water restored after a few hours after my call however I was unable to use the water as the pipes sprayed brown/blackish excrement for the next hour or so. This experience I was willing to live with and isn't the justification for my review. To be fair the customer service reps and front desk staff were excellent. The straw that broke the camels back was...    The fact that they ghost charged me for items I never used/consumed in the room. For transparency taking a potato chip can is $14 an 8oz water $12 and so on. I didn't consume or remove any of these items yet I was billed for over $100 worth of water and potato chips cans over the course of the week. I called to find if I could have these removed and was fallen on deaf ears. This type of business is misleading and unjust. There is no proof of exchange!    If they would be willing to dismiss those charges or provide proof I consumed the products I would change my rating but until then I will be staying at MGM hotels for now on.
30,Caesar‚Äôs is a great location however it is not the hotel we stayed at 20 years ago. We were in the Forum tower and the rooms and hallways need some TLC. Everything is worn but it was clean. We had several maintenance requests that I put in through the app and only one was done. There was also an event the weekend we were there which is fine but the different staff we asked questions of gave us conflicting information. Lots of restaurants to choose from and slot machine options. The sports book is really big. However if you are an early riser and want to play on a table you are very limited. The tables that are open have very high limits. While the location is great I don‚Äôt think we will stay here again.
40,The hotel is absolutely breath taking when it comes to roman aesthetics! There is a $152 incidental fee per night that you have to pay when you get there. Be prepared for congested lobbies casino's and restaurants! Bartenders and restaurants staff were very helpful! Food outside restaurants was subpar prices were jacked up! The hotel is a maze and unless your there for more than four days definitely look up a map to avoid getting lost. Executives of the hotel were extremely accommodating and patient in resolving issues caused by managerial staff. Before your trip research if there are any events going on in Las Vegas because they were doing daily closures of streets leading to Las Vegas BLVD that caused issues for Uber pick up/drop offs to airports over the weekend!
30,The room was not very clean. The neighbors were loud screaming awful named at each other. Security came but only told them to be quiet and that did nothing. Stay was not worth the money. Not very friendly at all.
40,We had a great time- no doubt. But the corners of the property seem a little worn. Torn carpet on the entry to our room soap shelf hanging off the wall at an angle. A small fridge would have been great for all the leftovers amd we seemed to not get our room made up three days in a row out if five.    That being said we had a great experience at this center of the strip. The cigar bar was an unexpected joy.
20,Spent 5 days at the 'Palace' for a conference.  Check in/Check out:  Took about 30 minutes to check in. They put your card on file for incidentals which is a normal practice however they neglect giving you any information about the do & don't in the room which can end up costing you unintentional fees.    Check out was easy as I used the check out machine. The machine does not let you view your bill prior to acceptance so if total charges are wrong you'll need to stand in line to get that corrected. Thankfully I had nothing added to the bill and didn't need to do that.    Casino & Restaurants:  The casino was really beautiful but if you want to spend time on slots go somewhere else. The slot machines didn't pay out so any money you spend is gone within minutes. The way the house always wins in this joint is almost immediate.    Food was incredibly expensive and the lines were long. I bought 2 cups of coffee and a ham and cheese croissant at Starbucks and it cost $28. Every restaurant was over priced. After spending $60 for a small wedge salad and a side of mac and cheese at the Gordon Ramsey restaurant I walked elsewhere for dinner. There are enough of reasonably priced restaurants on the strip.    Room and hidden charges:    My room was large spacious and relatively clean (the tub had not been properly cleaned and the floor looked like it needed to be mopped...couldn't tell if it was just old and watched or dirty).    They have a mini bar in the fridge and on top of the desk that everyone should be very afraid of. The prices range from $11 for a bottle of water to $100s for higher end items. What is not clear is that if everything is tied to a sensor and if it is off the sensor for 30 seconds or longer you are automatically billed! There is a sentence in very small font underneath the 'for your convenience' sign that states that items in the fridge are automatically charged to your room but says nothing about how they are charged. I had to literally search for the information as it was well hidden! If you store anything in the fridge they charge $75 and that is sensored as well. The room had a single serve kurig and an option to buy a coffee kit for $22 (4 pods; packets of sugar creamer etc.    Television and internet have spotty service. You can have 2 devices logged in for internet for 'free' in your room. Anymore than that it's additional $15.    Taxi to airport: Normally taxi service is easy as they are waiting at the intrance for a fare. The day I left (8:30am) there was a Nascar convention happening on the Blvd between 3:30 & 8pm so the entrance was blocked to all traffic. That's fine but Ceasars Management neglected to tell their valets what to do with those of us needing a ride to the airport. I spent over an hour walking behind the poor outside attendant searching to find where taxi pick up was! They had no idea at all. I texted Ceasars (via a number for assistance they gave me upon arrival) and was told pick up was out front per usual! After an hour of confusion and working with the taxi rep who was fantastic I finally was on my way to the airport. It took an hour and a half.    Honestly I expect higher prices in LV but Ceasars Palace is really sticking it to it's patrons and uses decptive tactics to make their money. I will not stay here again. There are far better places to stay that will treat the average person with greater respect and offer reasonable prices.
20,"I expected much better - even in the basic rooms - from a ""resort"" that's supposed to be ""high-end"" and charges ""high-end"" room rates AND a daily ""resort fee."" The rooms are very much in need of TLC - furniture & fixtures were banged up and shoddy the bathroom was not clean (hair in the shower) and even the throw pillow on the chair was threadbare.    Check-in was a crazy-long queue but the front desk personnel I dealt with were friendly. Caesar's offers a virtual concierge (no longer has face-to-face concierge services) that sends a constant stream of text messages touting their in-house dining and spa services. Make sure you hang the ""Room Occupied"" sign on your door if you want to forgo housekeeping services or keep other staff from entering while you're not there.    And don't get me started on the minibar! The prices are OUTRAGEOUS!!! $11 for a bottle of FIJI WATER???? $13 for an ""airplane size"" bottle of liquor???? $13 for half a can of Pringles???? Are you kidding me??? Not to mention I got charged (TWICE) for the Pringles I DID NOT EAT. And there was no refrigerator available for guest use - in fact they charge you if you use it for personal use.    Still trying to decide if I want to return to Las Vegas on my own dime - if I do I will NOT be staying at Caesar's Palace."
30,It was neat to see the hotel but the service was not there for the price. They do not require a card key to access elevators so all the hookers have free reign to the hotel. Been to Vegas several times will never stay there again.
30,We upgraded to a premium king room in the Augustus Tower because we read that the Augusta Tower rooms were better than the basic Forum rooms. Our room had a North facing view of the strip which mostly just overlooked the rooftops of lower buildings at the resort through rather dirty windows.    The room itself was large and relatively comfortable with an L-shaped sofa but the room had a fair amount of wear and was in definite need of updating. The carpet had heavy wear patterns and the ceiling in the bathroom had large areas of paint that were bubbling and looked ready to fall from previous leaks. Also one of our two bathroom sinks was partially clogged when we checked in.    There were only two small drinking glasses in the room and toiletries were limited --- there were no things like cotton balls q-tips shower caps etc. just the basics (shampoo conditioner body wash) and only a single bar of soap. Not what we normally expect from a 4 or 5-star resort.    The front desk and housekeeping staff were all very polite and professional. All-in-all the room served our purposes since we were there for a conference being held in the hotel but there are better options on the Strip if you are looking for a nice resort hotel.
30,The Good:  1. Was there for a biz conference and the conference facilities were very good with solid service (buffets coffee and water bars etc.)  2. The Room: Slightly dated and worn but VERY quiet (even next to the elevator) clean and the bed was comfortable overall was more than satisfied...Tip: Bring your stash of coffee pods they have a nice single use Keurig but charge you for their pods 4 pods at $22.75...  3. Restaurant: Had one dinner at Cafe' Americano the 24 hr restaurant and it was reasonably priced with great food (am not a big desert guy but had the waffle with ice cream and it was incredible) and service was very good...caution: Caesars like other strip properties is very busy and the several AM coffee venues were packed and slow moving so much so I did not even try...  4. The gym: I am a professional athlete (long time ski instructor so not well a well paid pro LOL) and found the gym to have a wide range of equipment and space...above average for a hotel...by the way there are two steep flights of stairs leading up to the gym (this is a quiet and uncrowded space) and you can make/add on to your workout just doing laps on these stairs and adding in body weight step ups and bulgarian split squats    The Not So Good or Bad:  1. Quick Check in was not operational: Caesars emailed me a Fast Check-In app I filled out my info but I was checking in at around 11 pm and the quick check in kiosks were closed (but with no sign) so I and many other guests spent time trying to get the machines to work  2. Regular Check in: There were 30+ people in line and without exception each check in took several minutes to get through with 4 front desk clerks...took 40+ min to get to me...then they try to upsell you in my case at $65/room/night for their newer tower (with a jetted tub) I said no and am glad I did...the staff are pleasant but they are also so comfortable being a part of subpar service...scary to think what this place would be like on a weekend or busier time (that is likely when the kiosks are up and functioning and I could see those helping)  3. Check out: Supposedly can check out with an assist from the TV which offers check out directions...they provide text option or on their website but neither of these options worked...I decided to leave early about 6 am and feared the front desk but at that hour there was no line and this was the most efficient part of the trip  4. Pathetic Elevators: I stayed in the Forum Tower...they have 6 elevators but only two were working and every morning save for my early departure it was the same thing: Packed Stopping at each floor on the way down...been in elevators in SF NYC Los Angeles/OC Chicago and this was the worst experience  5. Getting around/navigating Caesars: Took a bit of getting used to its a big place initially seems like a confusing maze but I did adapt and if you like walking (which I do) you quickly learn to like this aspect also I have never tired of walking through the Forum Shops one of the more remarkable man-made features anywhere!  6. Overall condition of Caesars was mixed: This property has been around for many decades there was construction going on all around to maintain it but worn carpet etc. The conference facilities were in good condition and were contemporary same with the Forum Shops which have been around for 30 plus years  7. Wifi was poor: Spotty reception...was constantly letting clients know that I would have to get back to them when I returned home    In summary: Caesars Palace is a casino and if I were a gold club member (high roller) I would have received better treatment it is just a bummer when they want the conference goers and those folks are treated like 2nd class citizens seems old school to me...    Knowing what I know now would stay here again @$204/night advance reservation and having a great conference it was worth it despite the hassels and knowing what I know would help to deal with it...
30,We requested the Augustus Tower for our stay at Caesar‚Äôs Palace since I had read that it had been newly renovated. Sad to say but our room was nasty. The carpet was worn and dirty. There were knobs missing off of furniture pieces. There was a blood stain on a chair by a desk. There was a Keurig machine with no K cups sugar or cream. We spent $5000 for a 3 night staff and it would have been worth it had our room not been an absolute dump. Next time I‚Äôll be at the Wynn!
30,We rented 2 rooms for a conference and were overcharged on one of the rooms for an additional night. I had to call several times to get it resolved and the only way they finally realized the error was when I had the compare the two different folios that should have been identical charges.
10,Checked in today and utterly disappointing at how disgusting this hotel is. This is supposed to be a nicer hotel even it it‚Äôs a bit old. I expected quality and cleanliness not vomit stains in the bath room dirty sheets and cigarette burns in the carpets of a non smoking room. Had I known how disgusting the hotel rooms would be I would have paid a couple hundred dollars difference and stayed at the Waldorf. Do not come here when there are newer better maintained hotels on the strip.
50,Our room was out of this world we love the luxury and cleanness's of the property  staff was very friendly  we arrive and not expected such a big and beautiful room.  we will be back again. restaurants had great food and prices very reasonable
50,I was disappointed to learn that the 3rd party booking site overbooked my room. Luckily Cynthia A the front desk associate at Cesar‚Äôs was there to assist me! She was great and provided great service! Even upgraded me to a better room! Thank you Cynthia and to the excellent staff for making my trip more enjoyable. I will definitely stay at Cesar‚Äôs for my next trip at Vegas.
30,After reading some other reviews here on Tripadvisor I knew I might get gouged but the manner in which it was handled really put a bad taste in my mouth. The key point I want to make here is that I arrived on Sunday evening (10/30) when the pools were closed for the season so I made a point of asking if I could get an adjustment to my $52.10/day resort fee as I expected that the pools would be the main amenity that the resort fee is covering. A very stern and slightly nasty manager informed me that the pools are not part of the resort fee (which I don't think anyone else would believe either) but rather the Wifi business center and fitness center are the key amenities which is laughable. Caesars may be charging the highest amount on the strip for resort fees and especially when the pools are closed seems really outrageous. I really think these hotels need to stop this sneaky and unethical practice and include the resorts fees in their base room charge as they are mandatory and excluding them from various website listings is misleading at best and a sleazy business practice unfit for any reputable company in the so called 'hospitality' business.
10,Horrible visit for a conference! If you don‚Äôt smoke prepare for secondhand smoke! Even the conference rooms were very smoky. My room had a nice king bed but had several broken items. Handles in the bathroom were falling off and the plumbing was causing back up in the shower and my sink was vomiting disgusting stuff at 11 pm. Had to redress and park up and go stand in line at the lobby for 40 mins to get a different room. I will NEVER stay at Caesars again and hope I never have to go to Vegas ever again. Very poor customer service.
40,My partner and I stayed here for five nights between the 19th of October until the 24th.    Check in/out:  We arrived around 2.30pm on a Wednesday and only waited in line for approx 20 mins. We paid ~$30 for an early check in (check in is from 4pm). We checked out on a Monday and waited in line around 30 minutes.    Location:  We could not fault the location of Caesars. It‚Äôs right in the middle of the strip and we found it easy to get around. The hotel has a taxi rank which always looked to move fairly quickly.    Room:  We stayed in one of the Palace Premium Studio King rooms which has a ‚Äòhis and hers‚Äô bathroom that was joined by a big walk through shower. The room was also a 5 minute walk from the lobby. Unfortunately this is also where we need to deduct a point as whilst we loved the layout and location of our room the cleanliness was something which left a lot to be desired. Upon entering our room we noticed what looked to be a red wine stain near the door as well as a sauce (at least that‚Äôs what we hoped it was) near the front light switch. It took five calls over three days to get this rectified; something which should have been dealt with before they even turned the room over to us. In addition the bathroom floors were never mopped and the shower heads had noticeable grime. For a hotel that charges ~$52 a night in resort fees on top of the room charge they definitely fell short of our expectations in this area.    Overall a great stay with some minor (and simple) areas for improvement.
10,Very disappointed in our stay there our first night we noticed the room to be dirty outdated & the smell of cigarettes. The following morning when we woke up we noticed dry blood in our bed. The same morning we spoke to one of the managers on duty and he did appear disinterested in our complaint he switched us to a different room gave us $100 to use in the hotel‚Äôs restaurants and did not apologize for the inconvenience. The second we moved into was a little better. I have stayed at La Quita & their rooms have been spotless. Will never return to Caesar‚Äôs palace. Can‚Äôt make this up.
50,We went there to celebrate a 21st birthday and the experience was incredible with a large casino level with all sorts of different options to win big and good walking distance to a whole load of Las Vegas sights and sounds. The member that helped us out Fouad was amazing will ask for him every time we go there when we return!
20,This place is enormous--We had a large group and we were all in separate towers!! We did not have a refrigerator to use without being charged. The rooms were just OK. Very little lighting. Our room had a coffee machine but no coffee. Upon check out we had charges for an upgraded room we did not receive. We had charges for an early check in that were different that other people in our group. All charges for different when we compared our bills. This places charges you for EVERY little thing. We would not recommend this hotel and will not be staying with them again.
20,Several disappointing things with Caesars Palace. I thought for sure this would be a great stay that was not the case. The building is showing its age. It is dark and dingy. The Venetian and Bellagio are bright and clean they feel much more welcoming. There were more smokers here than at the others hotel/casinos we visited.    And like others have said yes it is Vegas but the prices are crazy. I paid $7.58 for a bottle of soda in the lobby and then couldn't keep it cold without paying $75.00 to use the mini fridge! They can make money without gauging people in the rooms charging $10 for water and $75.00 to use the fridge. I also paid the $14.99 to add another device to our room for 24 hours. It only worked for a short time and then I could not access the WiFi. I am still working on getting a credit. When we checked out we then found out they charged our room for having two devices. We thought that was included. The woman at the front desk told us that with our conference we were only allowed one. We were not aware of that. But our co-workers room was not charged and they both accessed the Wifi. That made no sense. Our co-workers were also charged for items from the mini bar that they did not use. The woman at the front desk was not pleasant when the charges were questioned.    Like others have said the staff are not overly friendly either. No concierge to help answer questions or help you navigate through the hotel/casino.
20,We were in Vegas for a wedding and decided to get a suite at Caeser's. The room itself was spacious but that's where the pro's stop.    Firstly - if you get dropped off by an uber you'll end up walking 2km to check in and then get to your room with no help.    The fees are eye-watering $11 for 500ml of water in your room. $12 for 4 coffees in your room (no creamer/ milk/ sugar) $75 if you end up using the mini-bar fridge to keep anything cool.    The TV basically doesn't work. Staff treat you as a problem. The water gives you dry skin.    There was also a pair of sunglasses a betting slip and a USED CONDOM left in our room. I complained at the front desk and they said they'd sent house keeping to tidy those things away. They didn't. Absolutely rancid...
20,Something is desperately amiss at Caesar‚Äôs Place. My last visit was in the early 90‚Äôs. Back then the word Opulence was invented just to to describe Caesar‚Äôs. it had no equal in service and accommodations in Vegas    Fast forward to today and it‚Äôs decaying from the inside out. Poor maintenance dirty washrooms broken slot machines and they have axed just about every staff position they could. The remaining staff aren‚Äôt shy to express how unhappy they are.    Hotel rooms are a barren place on par with a Howard Johnson‚Äôs. They even took away the bible pen and notepaper! Cable TV system is a decade or more out of date. No security at elevators. You do get a QR code - it‚Äôs only thing not nailed down in the room. Think twice if you think this is a honeymoon destination.    Yet prices for everything have exceeded the insane level. $9.00 basic coffee $9-$10 for domestic beer at casino bar $10 mini bar water or pop $53 one topping takeout pizza and nightclub cocktail drinks at $27. Tips not included.    This has to be called out: 5 star prices for a 3 star product. This isn‚Äôt happening at other Caesar properties. Paris and Ballys just across the street have better service and much more reasonable prices. Caesar properties in Reno (the Row) are better equipped and prices are 40% less across the board. Slot machines are markedly better too (according to Nevada State Gaming Commission)    The flagship of the brand has lost all winds to its sail. I remain hopeful it returns one day to it former glory.    If you have already booked here you can be relieved much better service and food options and lower prices are only minutes walking distance across the pedestrian bridges.
10,My wife and I stayed five nights. We arrived on a Monday at 2pm. We had to pay $30 for early check in or upgrade. The room in the Palace Tower is a ten minute walk to the front exit. There is no refrigerator in the room. A refrigerator is $20 additional per day. There is a coffeee maker in the room but you have to buy the coffee. Daily maid service requires a phone call request to hosekeeping every morning.  Our advive stay accross the street at Ballys less glamour but they don't nickel and dime you for everything and you save a lot on the room.
30,Nice enough but Blingtastic to another level. Expensive even for Vegas but I guess you're paying for the name. It's a bit disconcerting that anyone can use the lifts to guest rooms but maybe that's standard.  Rooms ok cleaned daily.  Once inside the hotel you are completely anonymous.
10,We stayed here years ago and it was great. This time it came back as ‚Äúnever will we stay here again!‚Äù We came at check in time and the room wasn‚Äôt ready- we were offered an upgraded room at a discount which we accepted.  Long story short- it took four tries before we were given a room that didn‚Äôt have plumbing issues or already had another guest in the room. When we went back to the front desk we were told there was no way someone was already in the room. There really was. In addition to this we were charged for internet even though we used the hotel password to log in. We were charged $71.51 twice for items we took from the mini bar and charged us $44.42 for something we did not take. And to top this off we were charged $75 because we put a personal item in the mini bar. The lady that checked us out yelled ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you see the big red sign across the refrigerator that says no personal items allowed?‚Äù We honestly didn‚Äôt. It was humiliating to be chastised in front of the other guests in line. We have stayed in hotels all over the world and I can‚Äôt remember leaving a bad rating until now. And- because it took four tries to get a room- the hotel did waive the charge for the upgraded room.
10,Terrible!should not be qualified as palace.had to walk √† long way from selfpark to the checkin where we queue for 1h10. You cant possibly enjoy anything like the swimming pool when checkin is only possible from 4pm and you have to queue for more than 1hour to just get your room key!  In our case just to hear that due h√¥tel oversold they dont have rooms for us and had to send us to another h√¥tel nearby. Another waste of time to walk to the other locations with our lugagge and again 45mns queuing!.They promised that our deposit will be refunded and that we could use 100usd voucher at their food court. Bad surprise back homeno refund of deposit and 100usd taken from our account. A long serie of calls and e-mails where we were told that there is no trace of what we were promised and that we had to proof our say if we wanted to be refunded. Is this serious!!!!!it took 2 weeks where I sent them e-mail everyday to get the refund. They have absolutely no consideration for their customer. It seems to me that If I hadnt put all my energy and waste so much time to put pressure on them they would simply ignore the case. Never again!Plus
10,I‚Äôve stayed in several Las Vegas properties and Caesar‚Äôs by far is the WORST!! Besides not having ANYBODY to help with directions around this massive property no concierge no information center scare if any bellman the prices for everything are OUTRAGEOUS and EXHORBITANT!! And to add insult to injury you do NOT get what you pay for!!! The rooms are raggedy and outdated! The carpets are stained and dirty! The furniture is scratched and roughed up! This place soaks up billions from patrons DAILY!!! They can afford to spruce this place up and at least give you your money‚Äôs worth!! When making reservations it‚Äôs the old ‚Äúbait and switch!!! You‚Äôre given the prices for your stay as one price with the taxes and SOME of the fees and when you get here and check in the price is SO MUCH higher with daily resort fees that are never mentioned at the time of making the reservation. Then there is the $100 per day for everyday of your stay for incidentals and charged up front at check in along with all the charges for your entire stay! I travel extensively and have stayed in many luxurious properties. This place is the PITS!!
50,I am a real estate investor and influencer specifically in the Airbnb/Vacation Rental space. I was speaking at the VRMA conference (largest Vacation Rental Conference in the world) and my stay would NOT have gone well if I didn't stay at Caesars! I literally had to book my space last minute due to some travel issues. Even with a full house they found me a room that had a great collosseum view. They even gave me a AAA discount for the trouble! Before even asking if I was staying in the hotel they let me store my bags for a long as I wanted happily. After staying I had the best food at Joe's Crab and Steaks- a top notch high end seafood restaurant; Everything that I've had at Caesars was FANTASTIC! I then purchased a Rolex watch due to the success of my conference- Rolexes are near impossible to find in stores. THEY HAD THE EXACT WATCH I WAS LOOKING FOR IN CAESARS SHOPS! It was like I was MEANT to be here. Big thanks to Bryan one of the managers at Ceasars and the wonderful front desk staff who made my stay extra special. I'll ALWAYS be staying here when I go to Vegas!
30,A great building and location without a doubt  and has great restaurant options and shopping and casino Rooms are clean and good  not great. But at 500 a night it borders on the ridiculous. But Vegas is so busy the hotels know it will be full regardless. Food prices are ridiculous also.
10,Linens were terrible along with the pillows everything was over priced and they need to update the property as it was dirty and aged. The street noise was so bad with cars racing and police sirens we were unable to sleep I will not stay there again.
30,Hi I stayed at Caeser's Palace from October 22 to 24th in the Julius Tower. I had bad bed bugs the two nights I slept there with my shirt off (Room 1169). I called and they said they would follow up with me but I haven't heard anything. I'd recommend sleeping with a shirt on if you sleep in the beds.
30,I appreciated having a room close to the elevator‚Ä¶ i put my do not disturb sign the first night and somebody entered my room to leave some give aways I appreciate the give aways it was not the right thing to do. I spend 3 noghts my bathrub was never cleaned not even rinsed‚Ä¶. I send several mensajes to the online concierge never got an answer‚Ä¶ a couple details that I feel should have been handled !! I did get a welcome message that was it you create expectations but its not followed through‚Ä¶..
30,Daniel at the front desk was amazing as well as Dan the belllman. The hotel is nice but they have no control over the loud parties. Also Ceasars charges for every little thing. The ceasars has become corporate and has forgotten how to put the customer first.
10,"The nickel dining is shocking. There is a Kuerig Machine in the room but to get the pods it is $21. Checking in at 4 pm we were told if we wanted to get in the room WHICH WAS READY by the way... it would be an extra $31. On top of the room rate there was a $39 resort fee. Since the pools were freezing and I could not swim I asked what ""Resort"" facilities I was receiving for this up charge. I was told by an off shore based outsourced Guest Service department that it was the hotel policy and it included the Fitness Center and the Internet. I was surprised I wasn't charged for a fork at a restaurant! The Employees were so disengaged that I wasn't sure I was dealing with real people. When I asked what the hours of the pool were at the Spa Front Desk this is the exact response. ""I have no idea"" That was it. When I wanted to visit the pools to see them ( this is before I knew they were freezing and not usable) I was met at the entrance by security and asked gruffly to show my key. I said I will be happy to but first please say hello to me. Waiting for service at the front desk is an ordeal of at least 45 minutes of waiting in line to then have a totally transactional experience with nothing resembling a welcome. I was there to present a Keynote Speech on Customer Service to a large group of Vacation Rental Managers. . I did not trash the hotel from the stage to the 2000 attendees because I am sure each of them already was aware of the horrible service. I was however tempted to say ""Just do the exact opposite of what you are experiencing here at Caesars and you will be doing well. It was truly one of the worst lack of hospitality experiences I have ever had. There was zero acknowledgement that a human guest was there at all and the employees have become deadened to the concept of service. If you are thinking it is because of the volume. We walked next door to The Bellagio and asked a Security person for directions to the gardens. They not only responded with the directions they commented on the lovely new display and said ""You will love it"" They also have thousands of rooms and day visitors. Fish always stinks at the head. Shame on you Caesars entertainment for the decisions you are making at the top."
10,DO NOT STAY FOR LONG. We booked for 12 nights and upon arrival they sate the $52 resort fee (+$700 total) to use Gym (don't use) local calls (I have a mobile) and internet for ONLY 2 devices (it states free internet). What a joke! Also they charge a $100 per night incidental in other words they held on Credit Card $1200. MY TIP IS WHEN EATING ETC IN CEASERS DO NOT TIP....THEY CAN USE THE RESORT FEE.
30,"The hotel clerk talked us into ""upgrading"". I'd hate to see what our original room looked like! Maybe they should take some of the $50 a day valet charge and upgrade the rooms. Charge for coffee pods really!"
50,My husband and I stayed here for one night during a stopover and when we checked in Delano was so friendly. He gave us information about the best places to go and made sure we had the best experience. We have always stayed at the Venetian but after the kindness Delano showed us we will only stay at Caesars now. He was absolutely amazing!
20,I've been in Quality Inns that offer coffee in the rooms. Couldn't believe a hotel of this size would not have coffee in the rooms! Also channels on the TV guide would not turn on. I know not having coffee is a minor thing but couldn't believe this establishment would not provide!
50,First take the leap and stay at Nobu Hotel. It‚Äôs a hotel within Caesar‚Äôs right next to Nobu Restaurant. You avoid the craziness of the huge hotel check-in with all amenities of the huge property. The rooms are amazing and Gizelle at the front desk did a phenomenal job at check in. She was so kind and helpful. She placed me in an incredible accommodation making me wish I could spend more time in the gorgeous suite overlooking The Strip.    This is my second stay at Nobu Hotel and it is my favorite place to stay while on The Strip.
30,We were traveling for my best friend's birthday. I am in a wheelchair and she had an injurty and was going to rent a scooter on site. We had taken the red eye and were checking in after 2 am. This was a comped room and I had informed the property via their text app that we would be late. The man at the desk took my ID etc and went in the back. He came out and said Unfortunately there's an issue and we are sending you to our sister property The Flamingo. Just give them this piece of paper. I was confused for a minute then realized he was asking us to shlep all our luggage across the street at 3 am. so my injured friend me my wheelchair and all of our luggage went out and found our way. If someone had contacted me I could have had our taxi drop us off at Flamingo. Our room at Flamingo was not wheelchair accessible. So not only could I not shower I couldn't get in to pee.  When we got up the next morning I called Caesars to ask how would we know when our room was ready to come back and was told to come get in line at check in to ask. I refused. I was not about to spend time walking (wheelchairing) back and forth across the street to ask a question someone could answer over the phone.  It wasn't until I tweeted about it and asked if I should just go to Mandalay Bay that someone finally helped me.  I understand things happen but not once did the guy at the front desk or anyone I talked to offer any compassion or understanding. At the very end once they decided to help me that woman was great and told me that they had a handicapped room available. I asked if it had a roll in shower and she said it was accessible. That is not the same! Will anyone ever train their staff about such matters??So I was told to go check the room and if it was not okay to call back and they would change it. It was beautifu and the rest of the stay was perfect.  The beds are super comfy and the buffet is amazing.
10,unhappy with our experience at your resort    First night we were told the resort is sold out and we were our in the wrong tower but paid for the Octavia tower with pool view    Called that same night and said u guys can‚Äôt do anything because u are sold out  Second day went to the front desk twice wasted 4 hours in lineups missed my brunch reservation    Finally we got to move in the correct room and Maria at the front desk who spoke to her manger haviar  Maria said we would not be charged for Sunday night  Today I went to check out the lady at the express checked was rude and not helpful at all!!!    I told her we need to leave and told her all the above she said go stand in the other lineup  She asked me who I spoke too and I said I didn‚Äôt get the ladies name  She didn‚Äôt even seems to care or want to help    I stood in the checkin lineup and waited 1/2 but needed to leave to catch our flight    As soon as I got home I called and spoke to  Georgina 6pm Monday 19th at guest services.    I was told that she needed to talk to Maria and could not help me.    I requested a manger to call me back at their earliest convenience never heard back from anyone    I emailed the resort called them and even reached out on social media but nothing!!!  I guess I was just another number
40,Arrived at Caesars for a work conference and was pleased to see the newly remodeled entrance - very nice! Check-in went quickly as they had ample staff and the line went quickly. We were only in line about 20 minutes and found the front desk team very welcoming and well trained. We opted to pay $50 for early check-in because we arrived around noon and wanted to enjoy the pool and casino. Room had a comfortable L shaped couch king bed marble bathroom with shower and a separate jetted soaking tub. The closet had iron and ironing board a safe and ample hangers. King bed was very comfortable and had the best sleep there. Also was able to use the desk and internet for my laptop in order to complete some work done when needed. The light bulbs in the lamps were low watt and it made things hard to see would suggest they add stronger bulbs. The fridge is a mini bar and stocked and all items have a sensor so if you move anything - it will be a charge. Also on top of the cabinet are snacks also weighted and if moved- it will be a charge. The room was a little dated but clean and comfy stay. Elevators were dedicated to a small group of floors to allow quick access to the casino shops pool and restaurants. Pool was beautiful and there were plenty of chairs to relax and enjoy the sun.    The conference area had comfortable chairs great audio/visual service and the luncheon meal was fresh salads roasted vegetables flavorful chicken dishes and desserts of cookies pastries looked good. The conference staff so friendly and accommodating.    The casino is huge so wear comfortable shoes and we found the slot machines to be tight as our group discovered - the house always wins. Members of our group went to nearby Casinos and came back with some cash.
40,Hotel is very impressive and grand. Beautiful decor and surroundings. Lovely restaurants and shopping mall. Room was also great (we were in Octavius tower). My negative would be the staff weren‚Äôt helpful friendly or approachable and considering how much was spent is have expected more from them.
30,We have been coming to Las Vegas for over 50 years but have never stayed in Caesar's Palace. A conference that I was attending was being held there so this was our chance to try it out.    The staff was friendly and helpful which is always a plus. However our room in the Palace Tower was pretty beat up and threadbare. It is definitely time for an upgrade! We ate one time at the Americano Cafe and will never go back. The food was just ok but the prices were astronomical. We come to Vegas 2-3 times each year for business and are aware that all costs have really jumped up. We don't mind paying but at these prices we are much more selective about where we eat. We also tried the buffet. It was worth going one time but again we wouldn't repeat the experience. A couple of our favorite restaurants are in the Forum so that is a positive. We also tried NOBU for the first time and will definitely go back.    If our organization holds next year's meeting at Caesar's again (800 people +/-) we will probably stay at Venetian or Mandalay Bay and just Uber over to our meetings.
10,"I don't have the proper words that could make my review not sound as bad. It's by far the dirtiest and most disgusting room I've ever stayed in. As someone who travels on a monthly basis this is pretty telling because I've stayed everywhere! I've forgiven the wrapper on the floor filled garbage smelly towels and even the occasional items in toilets. I mean... I've stayed in rooms that I didn't get undressed from my travels because I was afraid to dirty up my body. This stay at Caesars ""Forum tower"" tops all the bad."
30,To start there is no question that this hotel is in a great location on the strip and is beautiful inside and out so no complaints there. However they could improve on a few things. Mainly referring to their housekeeping. The staff was not consistent and the button system did not seem to work well-we were left off the housekeeping list a few times and had to make a call. When we checked in there was a balled up tissue with lipstick smears on the bathroom floor and an old bandaid stuck to the night of one of the night tables - YUCK!!The toiletries as well as the toilet tissue were cheap and seemed to be chintzy with the amount they gave you. I think the Housekeeping Management need a to up the budget. Honestly the toilet paper was 1ply‚ÄîI‚Äôve had better at budget hotels!! And I‚Äôm shocked at the high prices these days in Vegas! Paid $84 (including tax) for two cocktails in the lobby bar‚Äî sheesh!! Restaurants are equally expensive (what happened to the free drinks and cheap buffets). Haha. Seriously though I know things in the industry have changed but I‚Äôll bring my own toilet paper next time üôÑüòÇ.
50,This hotel is hands-down the best on the Las Vegas Strip. The staff are always super friendly and make sure that we get everything (and more) that we need.    Shoutout to Julia in VIP who always gets us an amazing room and other special treatment.    If you want to stay somewhere with glitz glamor and plenty of things to do and see I recommend this hotel.    It‚Äôs even prettier in person!
50,We paid A LOT of extra $ for an Augustus Tower Fountain View room and it wasn't worth it. I believe we were on the 26th floor and it wasn't near high enough to see the fountains until the blasted into the air. For the amount we paid for a fountain view room I expected the view to be better. Besides this we loved our spacious room for our family of 4!  My family also loved the buffet! Though it did cost us about $300 for the 4 of us to eat the Sunday brunch. You can't beat the location! You're right in the middle of all the action. We would definitely stay here again.
10,CEASARS palace is a beautiful hotel the ambiance is impeccable! We stayed here for our honeymoon. We arrived and upgraded our room to a pool view. The room was big and clean and featured a huge jet tub.    One downfall is the TUB! The second night we stayed there the tub jets went on at 1:45 in the morning. Waking us out of our sleep. The third night the tub jets again went off at 12am 1:50 and again at 2:30. The lights in our closet also went on and off on its own at around 2am. Maintenance came by and told us that the jets had a cleaning sensor and cleans the tub after use. We told him we didn‚Äôt even use it so we don‚Äôt know why it kept going off.    The ice machines and vending machines also don‚Äôt work on our floor. There is a refrigerator but it‚Äôs stoked with mini bar items. We moved some drinks out to make room for drinks we bought and the hotel charged us. Which we disputed but had to wait over an hour in our room for a ‚Äúmini bar attendant‚Äù who never ended up coming.    We‚Äôll probably never stay here again. Customer service wasn‚Äôt so great. We ended up moving hotels and went to the BELLAGIO!
30,"When we checked in (about 12:30) we were told we would have to pay a $49 early check in fee. Being tired from travel we agreed. Then we were asked if we wanted to upgrade from our standard king room. I said ""No."" Then we were told there would not be any rooms of the type we had reserved available for several hours. We finally agreed to an ""upgrade"" for $55 a night. Our upgraded room was very large and generally nice but it only had a queen-sized bed. By this time we were too tired to fight about it but I felt like we had just ben through some sort of scam.  The hotel has lots of policies that nickel and dime their guests. They list a coffee maker as a room amenity and there is one but the only coffee available is from the minibar at $5 per pod. Our room had a large whirlpool tub but the water flow to the tub as so slight that it would have taken hours to fill it. The pools are lovely but to be able to sit in many places you must pay ""rental"" fees.  The staff (other than check in) were all lovely. The restaurants buffet housekeeping etc. were kind and efficient."
30,Stayed at Caesars because of the low rate. Haven‚Äôt been here for 25 years. The ceilings are low the energy old‚Ä¶ visited the Venetian and was amazed at the difference in environment. The people at the Venetian were younger and better dressed. The ceilings were higher the air clearer and it just seemed happier. I won‚Äôt make the mistake of staying here because of the rate again..
20,Considering how grand in appearance and magnitude Ceasars Palace is as a casino I would have hoped to have a similar experience as a guest. Nope. Check in was ok but at other large grounds have maps and some orientation provided. There was a link to an online map which failed to even identify my location much less help me navigate anywhere. It took forever to find the front desk from the rideshare drop off as signage was not great. They were able to check me into a different room before 4PM which was nice though it was also $50 more a night. The room was dingy smelled of smoke had a stain on a chair and part of the Jacuzzi didn't work. I had to wake up early for a conference and the most frustrating thing of it all was not having free coffee in the room. $20 for 4 Kurig cups. I've been in a lot of different hotels and this was the first time they ever provided a coffee maker and no free coffee. I would guess this is typical for Vegas but you also can't use the fridge and if you remove anything to even look at it for over a certain amount of time they will charge you for it. Overall I was very disappointed and if it wasn't for the conference I would never recommend actually staying here.
20,Upon arrival wiped down surfaces and the wipe was dirty. There was a rubber band between the bed and wall that was never picked up. Also 2 strands of hair on bathroom floor was not cleaned either. Not very clean. Not a lot of breakfast options early in am to get to conference on time
30,We were here for a conference otherwise I would have chosen a newer hotel. We booked two connecting rooms. When we arrived (it takes FOREVER to navigate from the Lyft drop off to the front desk) and waited 40 minutes in line we were told that they didn't have connecting rooms or even rooms reasonably close to each other. However we were offered a two bedroom suite instead. That sounds like a good deal right?    Well you get what you pay for. Our original rooms were supposed to be in the Julius Tower. Our suite was in the Forum Tower. The Forum Tower has not been updated in a long time so you get dated and dinged up furniture rattly air conditioners and stale cigarette smoke smell (even in the non-smoking rooms). Our suite was very spacious (2000 sq ft) but the decor made me think of the suite in Rain Man and everything felt old. I will say that the beds were comfortable (although the pillows were not) and there was usually good water pressure in the showers but there was no ability to regulate the temperature in either shower (one only had cold water the other only had hot water). For whatever reason the taps in the bathtubs and sinks did have both hot and cold water working but neither shower did. Very weird. The suite also had a tiny kitchenette with a full sized (and empty) refrigerator and microwave.    I get that staying in a casino is not the same thing as staying in a normal hotel. Everything is spread out with the hope that you'll drop money into a slot machine or make a bet at the sport gambling area. Also apparently everyone who stays in a casino is a smoker? I developed a cough from all the second hand smoke and I think my clothing and luggage is going to stink for a while. It's been a while since I visited Vegas and I miss the cheap buffets and free drinks for anyone gambling for more than a few minutes. Now everything is expensive. Which I wouldn't mind if it was good. But it often wasn't good.    The suite had lots of sofas and lounge areas and a high top table that seated 8 but no desk space. I did have to do some work and I ended up sitting on a couch in our bedroom with a pillow to prop up my laptop. It was fine but I wouldn't suggest it for any longer duration than an hour at a time.    We tried to go to the pool one afternoon only to find that it was closed for an event.    I will say that housekeeping is really nice and that the maintenance people worked hard.    The best thing about the casino is the location. We were an easy walk from most major casinos on the Strip so we were able to pop over for a meal or a show at many of the most famous places in Vegas. Also if you are tired of paying Strip casino prices you can cross the street to the Linq mall and get In N Out for their standard prices or walk a block to the CVS to get drinks for $2 instead of $7.
20,Women aren't only sitting home in the kitchen caring for kids. Yet Caesars Palace hasn't evolved. They lack anything for working nursing women. There isn't a place for pumping on the property unless you have a room. They charged for a fridge for breast milk storage. When asked what accommodations are made for visitors with diabetes that need to store insulin they charge them for a fridge. At some point a brand has to make evolving and reasonable accommodations from the learnings of an evolving more supportive society. Attending a work event party or wedding on the property is not great if you're a mama. The fridge was $75 a day    Next Don't ask for any support. We had 6 rooms rented for our work trip they put one of us in a separate tower and when asked to keep the team together they wanted an additional $400/night. It was ridiculous and felt calculated.
30,I booked a stay to help celebrate my birthday. Check in was hectic to say the least. Little details about the hotel given from the check in staff. The room although spacious is tired there were large scratches on the headboard marks on the wall faded paintwork. We asked for coffee and was told we had to pay for it we removed a few items from the mini bar just to place cold water in it and we told we had to pay for them even though they were not consumed! We asked for a mini fridge and was told we had to pay for it. Money money money!!! Yes the hotel is iconic but expensive tired and our room needs an upgrade. Ideally close though so top marks for that
20,I‚Äôve been staying at Caesar‚Äôs palace for 6 years now every time I come to Vegas. Well I have to look for a new hotel. I took the cheez it‚Äôs from on top the mini bari wanted a snap I knew it was $14. I didn‚Äôt check the expiration date it was over a month expired. I was eating them (not knowing the ex date) 15-20 minutes later I‚Äôm violently throwing up. I did not eat anything else that day. I contacted the front desk and Chrystal was going to call me. She called I explained what happened and very rudely she said it‚Äôs not from expired crackers and continues to tell me when she eats expired food (who does this?) she never gets sick so I‚Äôm not sick. I didn‚Äôt know she knew my body so well even better than me! I did have paramedics come to my room and check me out I was dehydrated in agony in my belly very weak and very low blood pressure. Before this time I would never say this please don‚Äôt eat anything from the snack section on top of the mini bar if u get sick in that hotel it‚Äôs just a nightmare and 0 help. Don‚Äôt ask for Chrystal this manager will make it out to be ur fault!!!!
30,Housekeeping was no show for every day of our stay even though we requested daily service. Employees cleaning other rooms would not even supply us with fresh towels told us we had to call to request.  The upgrade at the desk was sold to us as closer elevator to the lobby which was great as my husband has mobility issues we were actually farthest from everything and a very long walk very disappointed.
30,My room was clean. Nice sized room. No outlets or USB next to the bed. Booked several rooms for my company. One employee was nursing mother. She had horrible time getting space to hold her milk from pumping. She was ordered to take her milk out of the frig or she would be charged for removing the drinks. Then they brought a different frig (after 1.5 hours and 2 calls to remind them) that was so small it couldn't work. They were not helpful reading from a script. No understanding or empathy.  Casino as always smells like smoke.
50,Darlene At Diamond Check Inn was so sweet and welcoming at our check inn she was so helpful with my check inn felt like I was right at home. Such a charming funny person!! I‚Äôm about to win Big now !!!!!
50,Beautiful Hotel and Casino. Good food won a couple jackpots. We arrived September 24th from Tampa leaving the 27th. Hurricane Ian closed airports in and around Tampa. Ended up staying until Sunday October 2. Casino Host let us stay in same room. Even though our reservation ended the 27th. I highly recommend the property!!
20,So disappointed. I‚Äôve been dying to stay at Caesar‚Äôs for such a long time. I finally had the opportunity when my husband had a business conference here. The room itself was great. We had a million dollar view of the fountain the room is in pretty good shape and the bed os comfortable. I called for 2 extra pillows at 11pm and was told they would send some up. At midnight still no pillows so we called back and we‚Äôre told they were out of pillows. I laughed thinking this had to be a joke since after all this is a hotel. But no housekeeping told me they would bring me some pillows in the morning at what time would I like? I asked for 9am. 10am the next morning no pillows. I called again and was first hung up on then after calling back was told there were still no pillows. Our AC turned off at around midnight/1am and we couldn‚Äôt get it back on so I asked if they could check if out. No one came. I ventured down to the front desk and asked about the pillows but was told because it was ‚Äúfall break‚Äù for colleges there were about 4 people staying per room so they had no pillows. I went to college and I didn‚Äôt get a fall break besides Thanksgiving soooo I am not sure what she was talking about. Toilet paper is very thin and cheap. No brand name toiletries. No robes. No coffee maker or fridge and if you dare move their items out of the fridge to put your own you automatically are charged $75. Just overall really disappointing for a hotel that is priced comparably to The Wynn and Bellagio; both places that I have stayed and really enjoyed.
30,I stayed in the Forum Tower for a conference which was a little run down and could use some maintenance but conference price was cheap and I was only in the room for sleep. When you arrive at your hotel room check the mini-bar. If there are any empty spots anywhere immediately report it. Or get a full receipt and dispute the charges before leaving. I failed to do this and was charged for 2 thing$ from the mini-bar that I did not take. I ALMOST think they have a scam going on skimming a little from each unsuspecting customer.
30,I have been going to Vegas for 30 years. It‚Äôs much more expensive now at Caesar‚Äôs than in years past. Just does not seem like the value is there. Some nice improvements to the resort. However it feels like the service and staff are not at the standard as in years past. Pools are rundown and only 3 of them were open even with 88 degree weather.
40,Been here plenty of times. We love it. Asked for an late check through email as directed. Was told could have 4pm. I asked a question and then no answer. I tried to confirm the 4pm checkout with the email agent and the front desk no one could do it. Super strange and very disjointed experience. We made it work but would have been easier with the late check out since our flight wasn‚Äôt leaving until midnight or so.
10,Hire some managers give them some staff and train them. The service in all the resorts restaurants is MUCH to be desired and at these prices there is no excuse. There are many options on the strip and I will be talking to our conversation manager about a new venue for our events.
20,We had a cancelled flight from Vegas to Singapore via SFO. So we had to book hotel at 9 pm to stay 2 extra day in Vegas. We booked Caeser's palace at 400 USD/night. We checked in 10 pm. They gave us an upgraded room at another 100 USD/night additional. We went to room but could not sleep though we tried hard till 3.45 am. AC in room was spoilt. I tried to call guest services but the automated bot IVY kept trying to talk instead of human. And when I would click 4 for human the phone got disconneted.  finally 4 am I went to reception and said AC not working. They said they will send someone immediately. But nobody came. I went back again at 7 am and they apologized and offered me 100 usd dining credit. I was very angry as this is ridiculous of them not attending to my problem and we had a sleepless waste of night. Finally AC repair happened at 8 am and the technician said the filter was completely spoilt and hence AC was not functional.  When I went to guest services manager asked me why I am still upset and what is my problem ? She said AC was fixed so I should be good now. But what about the no sleep that my family had that night.  They are a very big hotel but had no technical support from 4 am to 8 am to sort out my problem.    Expensive hotel Poor Service and a Rip off.
40,First time staying at Caesar‚Äôs palace.  Check in was easy and the guy think he was called Dwane.. was great nothing was a bother.  We noticed over the course of the 9 days especially over the weekend there was huge check in queues. But plenty of staff and they appeared to go down quick.  We stayed in a huge room over looking the Belligio so we could see the fountains. That was amazing.  The rooms are clean and well equipped except no fridge other than the mini bar.. DO NOT USE as they charge $75 if you put anything I‚Äôd your own in and a small bottle of water was nearly $12.  Cleaned most days although most of the time it was close to 4-5pm. Which with a hotel that big you can‚Äôt expect every room to be cleaned in the morning.  The beds and pillows were so comfy. Huge walk in shower and jacuzzi bath and plenty of complimentary toiletries.  Plenty of restaurants to choose from in the hotel.  I would have given 5/5 if there was a fridge in the room. All in all well worth the money to stay here
20,"Went to Vegas for my friend's 50th birthday party. My room wasn't ready at check in so I had to cart my luggage around for an hour to hear that the room was still not ready around 5pm. I was ""upgraded"" to the Julius tower for the check in issues which was on the 4th floor of the Julius tower with a nice view of some sort of HVAC system. Furniture was chipped and outdated-- an ugly room. Thanks for the ""upgrade""!!! Bathrooms were nice and recently renovated though (the only plus).    I also accidentally left two credit cards in my room after I checked out. Called security before my flight left in the airport and they said they'd check the room and call back in 30 minutes-- no call back. Called a dozen times the days in advance to lost and found and they never answered the phone. So I ended up canceling the cards (no big deal but nice to know that Caesars has zero infrastructure for missing items in rooms).    This is a terribly run establishment. Only reason they receive two stars instead of one is that the Forum dining areas are top notch. So in the future I'll go back to Caesars to eat and walk around. Not a single dollar will ever go to gambling or accommodations at this dump."
30,There was a leak on our bathroom ceiling after I was ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù to Augustus Tower. Not great. View was nice but they shouldn‚Äôt have booked that room with that leak. Disappointing it was our first time staying at Caesar‚Äôs Palace.
50,Excellent property and service staff. Ivan Valino at the Rewards desk went above & beyond duty to help resolve my case of uncredited 5x multiplier. He kept in contact with me until case was resolved to my satisfaction. He valued my loyalty as a Caesars rewards member and made me feel like a VIP with superb customer service. Employees like Ivan is one of the top reasons I keep coming back to Caesars Palace and other Caesars property.
10,Used to love this place went on walks in the A/C with my grandmother. On my first actual stay as an adult the hotel was a literal nightmare.    Don't get me wrong the casino is great the pools are nice restaurants are good the shops are fun.  The Hotel itself it terrible.    Here is where they lose points  - Understaffed front desk  - No concierge  - Rooms smell like smoke (not a major thing it Vegas after all)  - Asked for extra towels and blankets and they ran out/ never delivered them!    The worst part was the room down the hall was throwing a loud party. That's cool for a bit but at 1AM I called the front desk - routed to India - told to check the front desk if I actually want to talk to someone  Security would 'check-in'  1 hour later - same party still raging so I walk down to check in with the security desk.  Oh - VIP event - you need to check with the front desk    Check in with the front desk  They can 'move us' to another room - won't ask them to keep it down.  I have a sleeping toddler- I can't sleep - wife can't sleep - moving is not an option at this hour of the night.    Plea with them  'No'    Ask them if I can knock on the door myself or call the police to file a noise complaint - at this point the night manager- Rosalie - threatened to evict us right then and there.  The house always wins.  I give up.  Get what sleep I can.    Not a place for a family even with a hotel sitter.    If you want to use the fridge - $75 charge  If toddler moves anything in the fridge - $75 fee  Basically a trap is setup in the room for any small children.    Tub was nice bed was nice room service was great. Management needs to care about the customers. Was staying here for a conference if I have any say we will be going to an MGM facility next time.
10,Front desk the worsed people i ever meet in my life  worsed services but caracters bad temper no information or willing to help  I arrived like an hour early at 4 pm  they want to force you to pay 60 extra dollars to go to the room you rent and pay for it very other place you can arrives at 11 am but Harras is 4 pm and they FORCE YOU to leave the room before 10 am  My son is disable suffer stroke and need to rest after a long trip  BUT even after i explain to the people in the front desk they only thing they told me PAY THE EXTRA MONEY or go to an other hotel
10,"Sadly this weekend was the last time I would ever stay at Caesars and here is why:  (1) the room I paid for based on the casino website photos is not what they had when I checked in;  (2) So I ended up ""upgrading"" to a room that was more like what the photos on line showed (Maybe this is how they operate. Show what you want to rent show up to check in and find out to get what you want to rent will cost more).  (3) The room furntire was scratched and broken  (4) the elevator looked like it was auditioning for a minor role in Die Hard. The floor was cracked and chipped the ceiling tile was missing and loose  (5) the Keurig machine was nice but tell me to bring my own coffee pods and sugar since none was provided. I wont be offended.  (6) The spa is limited to 3 hours (because corporate learned they make more money by moving people in and out faster creating more room for people. This is what I was told when I asked why the change). 3 hours may sound like a long time but their spa has alot to offer which can take some time to enjoy. And when you pay a resort fee on top of the spe fee you should be able toe enjoy that little something extra.  (7) The IVY text app is the worst. When you call front desk the first thing you hear is an automated voice offering you to use IVY. I tried it. Despite typing words correctly it never had an answer or knew who to contact.  (8) Speaking of Spa any chance to recharge a phone was removed when all USB ports were removed from the spa. Because my phone had died out I went to the spa front desk to ask to have a message delivered to my wife who was in the lady spa. The spa front desk lady called the lady spa but no one answered so she said she could not help me. The entrance to the lady spa was 50 feet away yet she could do nothing.  (9) Customer service? does not exist. (i) When I checked out I asked for copies of all the rooms I rented (for a trip for my staff). They couldnt give it and suggested I wait in the check in line to get it which had alot of people checking in. (ii) I had to return something I bought and was told the store opened at 10am. To play it safe I went at 11am and store closed. I called ""customer service"" to get help on when they would open legitmately and customer service said they could not reach anyone to ask. (iii) I tried to treat my staff to group meals but because there were over 10 of us I had to call to make reservations. When I called no one could help and no one could connect me to anyone who could help. I was told to try opentable so I did and because my group was large opentable required I call. So back to square zero.    I understand there was a pandemic and some inability to find workers. But Vegas has always imaged itself as a place where corners are not cut on service.    I tried to explaining these problems to people at the check out desk but all they did was give me a number to call. All I wanted was for them to know how the service use to be. I didnt ask not want a refund or discount. I dont think they cared either way. Caesar's I would ask you call me to go over any thing in detail but I doubt anyone would care either way."
10,Hadn‚Äôt been to Vegas in about 4 years so we were very excited to go. For almost $800 per night for our suite we thought it would be beautiful but no‚Ä¶ While the view of the fountain from our Augustus tower was good the room was dated carpet snagged in many places and worn dusty/dirty window ledges one-ply chaffing TP one box of Kleenex no robes only two washcloths towels and hand towels a coffee maker; but no coffee pods or a place to plug the coffee maker in on the counter it sits on etc. Nowhere to recycle cans or bottles so you aren‚Äôt trying to save the planet with your cheap Kleenex and TP. üôÑ    Beware: IF you even touch any of the snacks or items in boxes on top of the counter you get charged for them. How the heck do I know what‚Äôs in the box if I don‚Äôt pick it up to see what‚Äôs in it? I simply wanted to know what was in the ‚Äúgourmet coffee box‚Äù. We found out they have sensors on everything so if you pick it up and put it right back you still get charged. For $800 a night I would think I could get some coffee and a refrigerator what a joke!    And don‚Äôt order room service! The first time we tried to order from the steak house there was a ‚Äúmix up‚Äù and they thought we were coming to pick it up. They did cancel that charge. The second time we ordered breakfast and it arrived cold and inedible went right in the trash. It was seriously gross. I messaged the restaurant 4 times before someone responded and said they would cancel the charge but it still went through. Save yourself the headache and go eat somewhere else.    For that kind of money I‚Äôll spend a few more bucks and stay somewhere that is actually nice like The Wynn.
20,disappointing! We booked an upgraded room in the Augustus tower. The rooms are outdated carpets with stains. A bathroom with a jacuzzi that doesn't work. The hotel limits guests to connecting only two devices to a wireless network for additional devices they charge $15 in addition to the additional charges that are paid. When I contacted the reception manager to ask to add another device I did not receive a response and was told that there was no such option. Needless to say in 2022 a hotel that restricts its guests to connecting to a wireless network is ridiculous! An unpleasant experience I will not return to the hotel!
10,service in every establishment I went to was sub optimal if not shockingly rude. I was also charged $55 plus tax to check in early after arriving at 2.20 pm. I asked to speak to manager at front desk attitude and computer says no energy.  0 relationship or strong customer service skills.  Rooms are dated and premium price ranges to stare at an air con vent dressed as a great view does not cut it.  I will never recommend nor come here again m
40,Loved staying at Caesar's palace it was central to everything we wanted to do for our first trip. Only issue was elevators not working in the Octavius tower reported it each day of our stay and nothing was done about it unfortunately several other guests that were in the same tower had the same issue which was hampered things slightly but overall it was a nice place.
10,"I felt like we checked into Motel 6. Room stunk furniture scratched and in poor shape rug all stained. I asked for a room on a low floor- got floor 59. NO place to sit on main floor except the casino machines. LONG LONG line to check in. Thick ciggarret smoke in all lobby areas. Few places to eat. StarBucks ( there are 2) had 47 people on line in front of me. All you could eat buffet --$80!!!They charge $54 a day for ""resort fee"". The one day we went to pool ( 2 pm) they closed pool at 3pm because they had rented it out to Oracle for a private party!!. Staff was helpful but totally overwhelmed.  We demanded a refund and got it. Also complained about room and manager took $250 off our bill. Never again........."
10,No masks. Smoking everywhere. A maze. Completely demoralizing place. Everything to eat is mediocre at hyper inflated prices. Staff are not helpful and filled with a bit of disdain. Overall completely disappointed my employer picked this spot for a meeting place.
10,This trip was horrible. Caesars Palace service and hospitality was not good. Food prices were unbelievable. The Buffet was not anything special like they advertise. I should have had a host that cared. She didn‚Äôt. Everything we did outside of Caesar‚Äôs was more enjoyable .
40,Stayed 3 nights in an Augustus Strip view room.  We were worried about check in after reading the reviews but we breezed through (approx. 9.30pm) and got a free upgrade from the palace tower to Augustus tower which is right by reception.  Room had super king bed massive bathroom with walk-in shower and spa bath with separate toilet. Bed was super comfy. Great view of the Strip (Mirage way) and side view of the pool.  Check out was busier (12pm) couldn‚Äôt use e check out machines but staff helpful and took approx. 15 mins which considering the amount of people that were checking out with us was great.  Can preview room bill on TV in room so if there was anything to quibble about we would have known upfront.  Called guest services a few times and they answered quickly and were helpful on 2 out of 3 occasions.  Hotel is very busy all the time but atmosphere is amazing. We visited a lot of the strip hotels and Caesar‚Äôs remained our favourite.  We were happy with our stay and would recommend to friends and family. Try not to let these 1 star reviews put you off.
10,I attend a conference here but had my daughter and mom come with. The room was ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù upon my arrival because even though I paid for early check in the room was not ready. We were assigned a room that while larger then a normal room was clearly not updated in the last 25 years. The ‚Äúwindows‚Äù were really a mirror in one room and faced a brick wall on the other side. The furniture was broken. The make up mirror provided actually ‚Äúpopped‚Äù and then smelled like electric burning and clearly didn‚Äôt work. We had to call to have the remote batteries replaced. House cleaning didn‚Äôt show up for 2 out of the 5 days (and I had to call to get towels 2X because the shower leaked. I paid for wifi but that didn‚Äôt work. The mini fridge is a $75 charge just to open it and I had to pay 13 a day to have a small fridge delivered bc my mom has medicine that needs refrigeration. I have stayed in hotels before with issues is the room but not ones that I paid 350 a night for.
50,Excellent hotel and casino. I was happy my room was upgraded for my birthday. The different stores and restaurants was perfect. All the staff members was nice friendly and helpful. I will definitely stay at this hotel.
10,When selecting a place in Las Vegas do not consider Caesars Palace. Unless you are a so called Diamond or Seven Star the place is a rundown hole in the wall !!!!!  The area I stayed at was the Fourm I believe and that selection of the hotel was part the original Caesar that was there when I was out in Vegas in 1982 . That‚Äôs how old the rooms looked .
10,Type of sleeping room 2 beds was not available at checkin even though reservation was made 5 months in advance. Was informed that I had to upgrade to get a suite to get 2 beds. $100 plus tax per night additional. Was also told that my casino host would remove the charge because of the problem caused by the hotel. Upon requesting this action of the host he stated‚ÄùI cannot remove the charge because it would come out of my bonus‚Äù. So much for Caesars.
20,My wife and I stayed at Ceasars for three nights as part of a destination wedding. It was my first time to Vegas her second. I was pretty excited about the trip so I upgraded our room and ended up in the Palace Tower.    From the outset we were nickel-and-dimed on expenses. You cannot checkin any earlier than 4pm without a $55 charge. The price of a drink is at least $20. If you want a bag of chips from the hotel convenience store that‚Äôs another $10. Any semblance of a decent meal will cost you at least $50 per person. A food court sandwich without side is $20.    There is a resort fee of $52 a day. However no staff is around to provide service and when they are they can‚Äôt be bothered. They load your room mini bar with goodies but weight the tray they sit on so if you move them you get an asinine charge to the room. Same goes for the mini fridge which means you cannot use it as a room fridge.    Beyond Ceasars the new strip is filthy. While there is undoubtedly plenty to do and fun to be had. There is evidence of drug use everywhere every corner wreaks of marijuana and piss and cars flying up and down the strip. Yet somehow the place was overflowing with people. I just have a feeling people will catch on and the city is going to price itself out.    On the bright side we saw CarrotTop at the Luxor and it was surprisingly hilarious.    If you‚Äôre coming down just be prepared to pay. I was but got blown away at the cost of even the smallest conveniences. You can find better.
40,We - that is 6 of us went to Las Vegas for my husbands 70th birthday. We upgraded our rooms to overlook the Belagio fountains - the room in the Augustus tower it was huge with a sitting area and two very comfortable queen size beds the view was nice but only saw the fountains working a couple of times this was not the fault of Caesars just unfortunate for us as we had paid a lot for the upgrade and was disappointed. We didn‚Äôt get housekeeping for 3 of our 4 nights having to find fresh towels myself.  The lobby bar was our go to meeting place and our best servers were Rocky and Michele happy individuals who looked after us never seemingly leaving our glasses empty. Breakfast in Americano‚Äôs was good we loved the American potatoes and they had breakfast tea too. We all bought Christmas decorations from the little shop - can‚Äôt wait to see them on the tree this year. Date night for us was Gordon Ramseys pub and grill we had fish and chips which was delicious followed by a stroll around the Forum shops. Fountain of the gods show was tired and could do with an upgrade to be in keeping with the rest of the hotel.  We had a Cabana on Wednesday around the garden of the gods pool oasis which was heavenly. A swim in the warm pool and sunbathing in approximately 37degrees came just at the right time. Tamzin our server for the day was great at keeping us topped up with cold drinks and snacks. My husband and son in law had a little gamble in the pool poker table where my husband won $100 yayy happy days.
10,We booked our room paid a deposit and couple of weeks later I called in to pay the remaining balance on the room. The customer service took a payment and stated your paid in full. He advised me that a deposit will be do upon check in which was fine.We check in to the hotel and the customer service representative said we have to pay a deposit in case there was any damages so we said ok and he also asked if we wanted to upgrade our room we said yea he gave us our total and we provided our credit card. Now a week later we call to inquire about our deposit and the billing representative was so rude and over talked me the entire time. She kept saying we was billed wrong and that it wasn‚Äôt there fault. This was our first time staying at Caesars Palace and would be the last. Out of my many vacations in Vegas this is the worst. So unprofessional
50,Great stay  a lot to do and Everything is so nice . Great food and Service. Worth the money coming back ASAP . New favorite hotel in Vegas . Early check in and late check out are Extremely convenient.
20,I would not recommend staying here. Not only is it overpriced it‚Äôs not well taken care of. The air vent in our room (see pic) looks like it hadn‚Äôt been changed in a year. Everything is WAYYYYY overpriced and yes I understand it‚Äôs Vegas but it‚Äôs gotten out of control. Inflation I guess. Or they‚Äôre just trying to bring in the high rollers WHICH I have to say didn‚Äôt see much of them. Seemed like normal people just trying to enjoy a vacay party and gamble. But also the concierge staff sucked. I called a couple days before to ask about an early check in they said it would cost $25 and be no problem. When we got there around 2:00 I was told they only have 2 queen bed rooms available. Well I said that‚Äôs not what we want. So she said to come back at check-in time OR actually closer to 3:00 because ‚Äúthat will assure that we get the room we want‚Äù‚Ä¶.. what does that even mean? We paid for what we paid for‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre going to provide the room we paid for!! So she made it seem like we may or may not get a king bed room. I asked to speak to a manager and he did help us out. However we still had to pay a little extra for a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù room. Will never go back to Vegas. Not worth one penny. Stay somewhere else.
30,They charged me $52 per night as resort fee with any notice before. I was on business trip and my hotel had booked by company with advanced payment.  It is reallt guaging !!!!!  They should add to booking. And I didn't use any facility in resort other than room.
10,Well was really excited about staying at Ceasars but was totally dissapointed.  Paid extra for top room what I got was skuffed head board and skirting boards in room scratches everywhere.  The jacuzzi was not working worn and tired furniture and drapes.  Coffee machine not working huge lines for everything food very poor and overpriced gambling was very tight seems like the house has tightened up on everything just not fun anymore.  Under staffed and overworked  Complained to manager he just stared at me blankly.  Not impressed and very dissapointed was not expecting it from Ceasars will not be back!!!
10,The staff is trying but there isn't enough of them. Housekeeping is overwhelmed. Wifi disconnects. Food is outrageously priced. The smell of marijuana is everywhere. The check-in is VERY slow with long lines and few people. The slots are extremely tight. However the drink servers are frequent. The resort fee is way way way too high. Room service is nonexistent. Whatever you do----DO NOT touch any food or water in the room. They will charge you several times if you do. When I read that Caesars was being taken over by the Eldorado brand I knew it would be bad. But I never imagined it could get THIS bad.
50,Got put in the forum tower and the room wasn‚Äôt good. Went to guest services and Zakiyyah the manager was able to find us a much better room with no questions asked. Amazing service! Thank you for looking after us with just a simple bit of great customer service.
10,Disappointed from my the minute we approached the hotel:  - Greeted at an entry point by an over-served guest throwing up.  - Check-in team member rude for no reason.  - $55 early check-in fee.  - Octavia‚Äôs premium room very dated scuff marks all around the room shower leaking with water seeping through to the toilet area wifi did not work (or continued to drop out after connecting) mobile phone reception terrible no lighting in main bedroom with the exception of lamps fitted with globes that provided extremely poor lighting not even a pen to take down a note.  - You could clearly see the hotel trying to gain additional revenue for things you‚Äôd expect to be complimentary in a premium room I.e even the room coffee was at an additional charge!    - The only positive was the bed which was comfortable and the large shower with clean towels.    I‚Äôve stayed at many hotels on the strip and this was my worst experience to date. No more Ceasars Palace for me!
10,My advice is if you get a room in the Forum Tower..stay at another hotel. Our toilet seat was broken and the bed sheets had to be changed at 1am (big black marks on it‚Ä¶not sure what it was). The rooms were dirty‚Ä¶cobwebs and dust everywhere. All furniture had either scuff marks or were chipped. Dirt marks on the walls. The room was spacious and the bathroom was ok but dated‚Ä¶this would‚Äôve been a posh room in the 1980s (there was phone in the bathroom). We managed to get a late checkout until 4pm on one room but that was after spending 45 minutes on the phone justifying why we shouldn‚Äôt have to pay for it. The Wi-Fi didn‚Äôt work the the pool was closed for a private event for 1 day‚Ä¶but we were still charged the urban fee. When we tried to check in at 4pm we we‚Äôre told we had 2 rooms next to each other but they weren't ready yet (apparently check in is between 4-6) they will send you an email or text we never got one we went back to the front desk at 6pm to find we have rooms on different floors (57 & 64).    I would never stay here again or recommend this hotel to anyone I was so disappointed.
10,We booked our stay here thinking that the hotel was going to be absolutely amazing. I have stayed at the Luxor many years ago and it was stunning so thought Caesars Palace would be even better. Nope it was appalling. The room was very dated carpet looked old and dirty the cupboard under the tv had so many scuff marks as well as the mirror in the bathroom. When we complained the manager apologised and said we can upgrade but we have to pay more. The staff who helped with our suitcases and brought things upto our room were fantastic but some of the concierge and manager didn't really care. We paid an urban fee but not sure for what as the wifi didnt even work properly we had to buy our own water bottles and the coffee pods were not free either. We paid for the caesers palace experience and unfortuately we did not get that. We were just another number at the hotel and were not made to feel special at all. Would never recommend this hotel!
30,First time staying at Caesar's. Our handicapped accessible room was very nice--pretty and usable. However the bed was too high. With my extreme arthritis it was very painful and difficult to get up on/in to the bed  The place is massive. Too big for me. I rented a scooter so it was do-able but just too large. Our room was in the Octavius tower.. so far away from everything.  Did not like the feeling inside the casino. We were shocked that on Sunday night the Craps and Blackjack tables were $50 minimum bets! WTF? Too rich for our blood. For the next few nights that was the norm altho a couple $25 tables opened up.  We've always loved the restaurants at the Shops at the Forum but not so much the ones inside the casino. The only real Breakfast eatery was so expensive and crowded-- long lines in the AM.  Staff everywhere were very friendly nice helpful. But the place just did not feel comfortable for us.
10,Atrocious customer service. The front desk gave me wrong directions charged me unfair additional fees and had lots of false information everywhere.    The gym closes at 5:00 PM (don't trust the website). No room service delivery even though you can order it and they won't refund you.    They nickel and dime you around every corner and even go out of their way to make it difficult on their clientele.
10,We stayed in the Octavius tower for 3 nights and we were not expecting this for a nice hotel on the strip.    - Lights don't work. There were 5 different lights across the entire room that wouldn't turn on.  - electric outlets don't work.  - vanity mirror light doesn't turn on.  - we asked for another room and the front desk offered a maintenance service at 8am.  - next day maintenance never shows up.  - we asked for another room and they said no.    This is unfortunate as I've had great stays along the strip. These may seem like minor trivial issues but for the amount we pay to stay here I would expect things to work. Most of all service was non-existent and they were not helpful.
10,I can't say I've ever had the desire to go to Las Vegas but when a business conference brought me to Caesars Palace I thought I'd see what it was all about.    Pros: Room with a view of the Bellagio Fountain the bathroom was beautiful and spacious in our room - the room itself was nice. Amalfi by Bobby Flay was the height of the visit - an absolutely fantastic restaurant.    Cons: THE SMOKING! As someone with horrible allergies and not being able to stand cigarette and cigar smoke it's everywhere... casino restaurants walking hallways stores etc! I realize it's Sin City but it's also 2022 - smoking should be in a separate casino area with doors and walls so others don't have to smell it. Not to mention the pot smoking going on throughout the hotel. We had to wash our clothes twice upon arriving home just to get the smell out. It really limited what I could do while visiting.    The layout of this (and other) hotels is terrible. There are 20 different ways to get to different locations and there are confusing signs everywhere. I had to use my phone GPS twice upon getting lost. I feel they planned it this way to trap you there.    No matter the time of day there are thousands of people all over long lines to get into restaurants where reservations are not required and everything is insanely overpriced (nevermind that none of the items in the hotel have price tags which is how they try to get you). $7.00 for a bottle of water $20 for a poorly made salad and the list goes on. I went to CVS across the street and bought all of my water there for $2 a bottle.    NOISE! You cannot hear anything (primarily) in the cocktail bars because they have the music blasting so loud. Combined with the drunks screaming slot machines going off and other people there is no quiet place aside from your room. It is sensory overload.    It was an experience but I won't ever return to Las Vegas. It's like the hotel tries to attract the high-end crowd with expensive stores and fancy restaurants but most of what you see are trainwrecks in sweatpants people wearing clothing that is 3 sizes too small and the homeless wandering around inside and outside of the hotel.
20,I do not like to give bad reviews but I was so disappointed with Caesar‚Äôs. No free coffee in room and to get 2 Wi-Fi devices costs $14.99 even though I am gold member i wanted to buy wine from in room bar but no glasses. I was told to use paper cups or buy the glass and ice bucket kit.  That is just sad. I expect they will start charging for each toilet flush. Oh yeah over $50.00 a night resort fee to have the pleasure of gambling.  And difficult to get from parking garage to registration area.  Why can‚Äôt they give you the change amount on your gambling ticket? Change shortage really!! They make a lot of money playing this game. Round up and give your customer their money    The good review. I paid for upgrade and room was nice and housecleaning made up my room Yes fresh linen and towels. Just like pre-Covid days
30,Beautiful hotel but old falling apart rooms. Certain outlets didn‚Äôt work hot water took forever to warm up dressers were old and scratched. Just didn‚Äôt feel like the palace and didn‚Äôt live up to the hype
50,I love this hotel this is Hight Class Peoples I left my phone in Gambling Machine and I get back From Security Counter it's show about the Hotel Protected everyone Be save and enjoyed your Vacation time in the Right place of course I be back in Chris Mach time for long vacation see soon Friends Jean Cave Creek AZ
10,My family checked in after making reservations 5 months prior. We were guaranteed adjoining rooms (necessary because of my mom needing extra help) Checked in and was told they can't honor the adjoining room but we would only be a few rooms apart. Plus they said we refusing cleaning service which we absolutely never did. A few rooms apart turned out to be 8 floors apart. S/W the manager she said she might be able to change the rooms the next day. I then asked her who wants to spend a chunk of their vacation moving their rooms. Her answer was call 1st. Honestly so disappointing. Plus we are staying in the Octavius 2 queen room and the floor was dirty plus the molding was splintering in the shower. We are supposed to supposed to be staying 7 days and this experience of poor check in has completely soured the vacation
50,I have used the text message based ‚Äúpersonal concierge‚Äù while my stay at Caesar‚Äôs. It is great. They‚Äôve helped quickly and professionally on a couple of issues. Issues where it was hard getting someone in the phone. Highly recommend.
30,Informed the reservations that I will be arriving late maybe after midnight. We bed room for the Octavius Tower with 2 queen beds. They seem to have given our room away and got a room I. The Palace Tower with 1 King bed. Thought sleeping with 2 70+brothers in the same bed. Requested a rollaway bed but it never came requested twice at he front desk and the maid service and they assured me they will get one. No rollaway had to sleep on the couch.  I did get an additional $50 room credit for the problem and the room was still very nice so the rating of 3 dots does seem fair to me.
20,Caesar‚Äôs is a nice hotel and destination but they nickel and dime you for everything. Coffee pods in the room $22 water $12. The mini bar was missing things when I checked in and they charged me for them. I had to dispute $22 $11 $163 and $33 Mini bar charges. They did take them off at least. I arrived early and wanted an early check in $55 for 2 hours. I have travelled a lot for business including Vegas quite a few times and this was the worst. Stay somewhere else and go there for the shows shopping and restaurants.
10,Really bad experience staying here. First we got to the room and 1 am and they said that room service wasnt available. The light doesnt function in the bathroom. I asked for hangers the day I got here and to get 5 extra hangers they needed my credit card to leave a security deposit for 5 hangers. I still have 3 days left hopefully it cam get better.
20,Stayed here for 5 nights from 16th sept The hotel casino and bar areas are pretty decent and appear in relatively good condition. But then you don‚Äôt look and the decor much when you‚Äôre playing the slots. The issue we had was with the room the decor is old the carpet were frayed especially where it meets the tiles to the hall way. This was extremely frayed and area of the carpet around the beds and by the Tv were also frayed in areas not what you expect from a 4/5 star hotel. Three of us shared this room and with the luggage and 2 having to share bed it was a squeeze‚Ä¶.We did ask for an upgrade but due to the cost it would have been we declined.  I have stated in vegas 3 times now once in the Luxor and the encore. It‚Äôs sad to say that caesars is at the bottom of my list so wouldn't stay here again.
30,Everything double price what you would pay elsewhere. Plan on 200 or more for dinner and 60 for lunch. Need reservations for dinner. It is busy all the time. You will likely not eat where you want by procrastinating. Fountain view nice but not sure its worth the extra money. The gave away our handicapped room and upgraded to a suite. It was nice but had some maintenance issues. At 2500 a night I expect more.
20,This is not the icon of the past. The prices for everything are insane  The staff was rude and could care less if you were not satisfied.  My friend checked into her room and it was not made up. The bed was used and there was trash left in the room from a previous guest. The staff would not give her a different room and instead gave her sheets and a few towels.    The prices for everything are insane. You even have to pay for the coffee in the room. I will not go back
20,Walked through and decided to sit and have a cocktails in a lounge close to reception and gambling. I don‚Äôt mind paying for drinks when they grab your wallet and shake it but give us some ambience or good music of value for money. Lesson learnt not doing that again
10,Worst experience ever. It's 1am and finally in my room. Arrived at the front desk at 11:20pm. No kiosks open no priority for their status members. After 30 min wait greeted by a gentleman. He disappeared for few minutes to find me a room. Returns and hands me a key packet with no keys. Finally get the keys. Room is as far as possible from the parking it took 20 minutes just to get there. Hallway smelled like weed and keys don't work. Called the front desk called security even used their texting platform IVY all with the promise someone will be up shortly. 30 min later security finally showed up. Extremely tired and falling asleep all the sudden several knocks on the door. Housekeeping showed up at 1:15 am to collect the air purifier they left in the room. Asked for the manager but I guess no one available or anyone cared enough to connect with us.  LB
10,Lousy elevators old run down room coffee machines with no coffee $1000/night/room but over an hour in line to check out $30 for an orange juice and had the usual $50 resort fee shoved down my throat despite not utilizing any of the facilities.... Looks like Ceasars Palace is in a death spiral not realizing the expectations of their customers paying top dollar..
10,When I checked in to my room in the forum I wasn‚Äôt satisfied. Seeing the other rooms at the other end of Caesar‚Äôs there‚Äôs no comparison. My room smelt and all the furniture was dinged and scratched. The forum was also a very scary area to walk through alone at night to get back to my room. Being there for a wedding I had no time to talk to someone right away so I just dealt with it. On the second night of my two night stay I saw black mold on my bathroom wall. I attempted to talk to someone early in the morning but the lines were long not moving and I had to attend the wedding. Later that evening after checking out at a kiosk in the am I went back to the front desk to talk to a manager. The manager didn‚Äôt apologize didn‚Äôt offer compensation truly didn‚Äôt care and basically acted like I had done something wrong. He also didn‚Äôt even care to look at the picture I took. He said the engineering team would look at it and if I felt like it I could contact them back again as if this was my fault. I walked away and tried to ask someone for a number to contact someone else and again got no response from reaching out.
10,My husband and I came out to Las Vegas to celebrate my birthday. This has been the most disappointing stay we have ever had here. We were at bellagio for 4 nights and everything was perfect and exceeded our expectations. From check in until this time several things were not even acceptable. We spent 10 hours on the phone as well as in person trying to get housekeeping services. At about 8:00 last evening my husband went to see a host to see if he could help us get service of some sort. He was told HE had to contact a hotel mgr..you would thing he would have contacted someone for us I  Or given advise on how to reach one. Our host is an off site host and sine the problems continued until 1:00 am we didn‚Äôt contact him... We finally received towels and were able to empty trash at 10:30 last evening. Other than that no services were provided. My husband was given drink vouchers and was    told caesars restaurants would accept them. Not only did the restaurants not accept them but couldn‚Äôt find a bar that would either. My husband tore them up and trashed them. We tried to go to the americano grill yesterday at about 1:00. The restaurant shut down all but a few tables on one side of the restaurant and told us there was a 30 minute wait. Why would they shut down on a busy Sunday with a line of 30 minutes. Don‚Äôt you want to serve your guests??  We value our off site host and sent him an e mail this am  We were contacted by a casino host after reaching out to aj.Duhe.  What has happened here?? I was even wanting to take out lunch today from Beijing noodle and they were charging me 3.00 for a box.. are you kidding me. I cancelled the order. Went to old homestead last night for dinner and requested bread. They now charge 10.00 for bread .. we are not cheap an don‚Äôt even pay for much here because of comps but find things here have really cheapened . We were also sent an e mail months ago stating now that laurel lounges dimming guests would be receiving an amenity. Of course that never happened either.. didn‚Äôt need anything as the bellagio sent us fruit candy and cookies upon check in which we brought here. They even have a vip lounge for check in with food items throughout the day.  Just thought you should nap be made aware of how this place is run and how cheap Caesar‚Äôs has become  Thank you for your time
20,I have stayed at Ceasars Palace a few times in the past and always enjoyed my stays there that was until my last visit and stay. I upgraded my room which was great a nice option but to be honest the extra nearly $70 per night came up craps! The jacuzzi jets did not work. The television in the room could not be angled or turned to watch other than facing the bed. The air conditioning did not work properly I was either very hot or cold! The cost of buying food is outrageously expensive I mean $30 for a burger and fries or slice of pizza and salad or drinks and that was food in the food court not a 5 star restaurant I know inflation has been the highest in years but seriously is Ceasars still trying to make up for the Covid period? I don't know I may stay away from Vegas for a while
50,Front Desk gave us a Beautiful room overlooking the Belligio Water show‚Ä¶.and the Las Vegas strip‚Ä¶However everything is very expensive especially in the essentials store's restaurants etc. The staff was very knowledgeable friendly and helpful. We were very happy with the fantastic location center strip. We were planning to frequent the pools but find the rental fees and drinks were out of reach. However we had a a superlative memorable stay..
10,I arrived after midnight with my 5 year old son after a long day of airline travel. As you can imagine my son was extremely tired and cranky. After a long walk from the rideshare drop-off we were so excited to be checking in. That is until we talked to the staff who were rude and dismissive immediately. I presented my reservation ( I had a confirmation number ) but was immediately told they had no room for us. When I asked how this could be they said that my reservation was through a third-party and it was not their problem. They just tossed my son and I and all our luggage back on the Las Vegas strip without a care in the world. Omar in particular was the worst. I have never been treated with such disrespect or encountered anybody with so little empathy. I had a reservation and they abandoned us! I used to have fond meteorites of Caesar‚Äôs Palace but I will never go back. They are horrible.
10,First time at Ceasars and last! From the moment I went to the KIOSK to check-in it all went south from there! the ladies that were there supposedly to help you don‚Äôt know jack-sh‚Ä¶t!! Then my room as was nasty Beth room was terrible the water from the jacuzzi tub will not drain they charged me $16.32 for 2x items from their bars that I never even touched $52.04 is for resort fee per-person F‚Ä¶.ing rep off! Staff doesn‚Äôt know anything or where everywhere is‚Ä¶ Never again at Ceasars üëé. Highly NOT recommended!
40,Hotel was very nice and Staff all very Friendly and helpful only complaint WIFI kept dropping off line and even after speaking to the IT people it continued to happen I would stay here again really enjoyed it
20,September 16 2022    I returned home from my Las Vegas vacation and stay at Caesars Palace. I had never stayed at the iconic resort before and was quite looking forward to it. (Even though it was more expensive than other resorts). We stayed in the Forum Tower and our room was quite spacious but very dated. It could have really used a refresh. While I understand the whole theme of Las Vegas hotels is to not make rooms too comfortable so guests don‚Äôt spend too much time in them there are times people need a break from the lights and excitement of the city.    Caesars charges a $52.10 per day resort fee (resort fees are illegal in Nevada but all the hotels charge them.). The resort fee is supposed to cover internet fees and gym use (whether you want it or not). Much to my surprise I learned that the internet fee only covered allowing two devices to be connected in a twenty-four-hour time frame. Given the technological age we live in this is ridiculous. My partner and I could not use our tablets and phones simultaneously. We could also not disconnect from one and connect on the other. Whichever one you connected on was the one you could use for a 24-hour time frame. I had to consciously make sure both were off when entering my room so I could decide which one I would use in the room.    I thought I was just having technical problems so I called for tech support. The policy was outlined for me and I was offered the ‚Äòopportunity‚Äô to connect another device for an additional $14.99 per day. I was also reminded there was free internet in the lobby. This did not work so well.    This issue ruined my stay and I would never stay there again or recommend this hotel. Just a huge disappointment to a much-anticipated stay.    I should add that I was visiting from another country and did not have an international phone plan so I relied heavily on WIFI.
10,Very sad that they have started to way over charge people for everything! Poor service bad attitudes host with nasty attitudes! VERY EXPENSIVE to be treated so poorly by the hotel staff casino staff casino host restaurant staff!
30,We stayed at Caesars Palace for 8 nights in Sept 2022. We were really excited to be staying here but unfortunately we left disappointed.    The queue to check-in was about 25 minutes you could use the check-in machines but I wanted to ask a couple of questions so we had to queue. The check-in staff member was friendly but didn't give any information about anything in the hotel. Nothing about pool opening times any amenities nothing really. Just directions to our room. When we checked-out the queue was about 50 minutes for the desk.    Everyone talks about resort fees but I can honestly say for the price Caesars are charging everyone has a right to complain! The price point for this hotel is at the higher end including the resort fee charge. Now you know the charge before hand and what that covers but what you actually get is quite different. I cannot comment on the gym as we didn't use this facility (we did enough walking for our daily exercise!). The wifi however is well shocking! You can only connect 2 devices per room (ridiculous in this day and age of technology!) and any additional devices are charges at a staggering $14.99 PER DAY PER DEVICE!!!. It really wouldn't hurt to allow 1 device per guest at least?? The actual wifi is rubbish you are constantly disconnected which is not great when you are trying to book or arrange trips/tickets/check-in etc. The worst is at the Uber area just outside. Now as Uber is an online service to book you would think the wifi would work in this area but no it doesn't! You have to walk back to the building to be able to pick up a connection. Come on Caesars get with the 21st century!    The pool area is nice but the sun loungers are very tired and quite a few are either broken or have large holes in them. The large central pool is quite cold but you soon get used to it and it is quite a nice relief after being in the sun :) There is also quite a lot of rubbish underneath the loungers which can be seen when you are in the pool as you are at eye level. I just think for the price Caesars are charging for resort fees (in which use of the pool is included) they would take better care of the area and invest in updating the loungers.    The room itself was quite spacious. We were in the Augustus Tower with a view of the Bellagio fountains. The windows could do with a clean but the view was nice. The room is getting a bit tired with a few areas of damage. The towels and face cloths could also do with updating quite a few were becoming a bit thread bare. It was also not very nice to unfold one of the face cloths to find false eye lashes in them! The TV in our room glitched every few minutes which made viewing a little frustrating but this is minor as you don't really watch much TV whilst in Vegas! I would suggest requesting a higher level room (we were on floor 28) as the noise from the road was loud.    Housekeeping was great. We had been advised it would not be everyday due to staffing. No problem we were happy to just request towels etc. when needed but apart from the first 2 days we had housekeeping everyday. They were always friendly when we saw them in the corridors.    Overall we were disappointed with our stay. For a luxury hotel that claims 'infinite luxury' I think they need to up their game. This felt like more of a 3* star standard :(
10,It was a waste of time and money going to Ballys Casino in Las Vegas. We were not given the smoking room that we had booked earlier because they were overbooked. When we went down to eat 3 pieces of pizza and a beer cost us $35.00. If we wanted a cup of coffee we had to go down to casino and be playing a slot. My cup was half gone and so I took 5 steps over the bar to ask if he could refill my cup. His response was that it would cost $8.00 because I was not sitting down at my machine. Even though he seen me and spoke to me 5 minutes prior. I lost $100 in less than an hour in a penny machine. We would like to go back to Vegas but I will NEVER again go to Ballys Casino.
30,"We are ""older"" visitors and found Caesar's too vast and confusing. Now everything is electronic and we had to ask a ""younger"" person to show us how to scan. We paid for a room upgrade and the maid never showed up at all for one out of three of the days. Nowadays not even a pen and piece of paper to be found in the room. Caesar's food court for casual eats had terrible food although apparently Bobby Flays burger place had good burgers. Bacchanal buffet is still the best food though now $80 per person. Prices are high everywhere and it is our last time to visit Las Vegas."
10,"I have been a Diamond & Diamond Plus member for over 30 yrs. The ""best"" room I was comped for this trip was a refurbished small rm in the Julius tower. The carpet was old and dirty. The view was an enclosed area of pipes and machinery. I had 4 days booked & requested housekeeping clean only the 3rd day. After calling housekeeping FOUR times speaking with TWO hosts requesting the room be cleaned at the Diamond check-in TWICE and then waiting from 11AM until noon the NEXT day--the room was still NOT cleaned. I printed out a comp for the High Roller and after we stood in line for over an hour the incompetent person helping us board decided he ""couldn't read"" the printout & refused to honor my comp. My name and the date were CLEARLY on the printout---he just didn't care! The beverage servers were actually (surprisingly) frequent at slots & that's about the good thing. I really don't think it's worth maintaining Diamond status if I get so such shoddy rooms/service/hosts. MGM & Wynn have NEVER DISRESPECTED me as bad as Caesars!"
50,Absolutely great time the shops and the food üíØ The gaming was very entertaining and just overall a really nice time from check in to check out.  Ceasars Palace is a great vacation let‚Äôs do it again soon!!!
10,I spent 11 days at the Hotel. During all this time the elevators to the exit of the parking lot were broken working only catching lines every day. Not once has my car pulled out of the parking lot that my room key worked. Every time I had to talk to someone. I've never seen a hotel gym close at 5pm. And even when I went out there was a charge of almost 250 dollars for a minibar that I didn't even touch. Really a very sad experience.
30,We stayed 3 nights in the Caesars Palace our room was not once cleaned‚Ä¶the first day we asked the cleaning lady who was on our floor in the late afternoon to give us at least new towels. She didn‚Äòt have any left so she said she would call somebody to bring towels. Nobody showed up. The second day our room was again not cleaned so we called housekeeping to get our room cleaned and to get new towels. NOTHING happened! This is not okay and we are very disappointed by this poor service‚Ä¶
50,Lat minute booking to be off from work enjoy the stay with my wife. Upgrade was very reasonable and comfortable First time stay at Caesars and definitely not the last one. We‚Äôll be back soon with the rest of our family to enjoy this place.
20,"We were now for the fifth time in Las Vegas (MGM-Grand Venetian Wynn and Mandaley Bay).  The Caesars Palace was by far the worst hotel so far.  Check in:  Unfriendly. We checked in at 5pm and our booked room  wasn't ready yet. After hours of travel we didn't feel like waiting any longer  we accepted a downgrade.  Of course without reimbursement.  When asked if a free breakfast would be included  the ""friendly"" gentleman just looked at us in astonishment.  Room:  Old worn out dirty. After stepping into something sticky  we cleaned it first with a towel.  There was not even room service during the 5 days.  Well my bed really doesn't need to be made every day but the garbage disposal does  or new toilet paper we had to take care of it ourselves.  At these prices just incomprehensible.  Hotel:  If you go to Las Vegas you know that it is expensive.  But this hotel is a rip off machine.  A really small cocktail at the pool from a plastic cup costs 20.99.  He didn't taste it either.  4 coffee capsules for the machine in the room cost the proud price of 21.99.  Late check-out (departure 4 hours later) costs 100 dollars.  The whole hotel complex is really impressive and beautiful.  Pool:  Really nice. However it is difficult to get a lounger because of parts of the complex  were blocked.  Conclusion:  I will never book the Caesar Palace or any hotel in this group again."
50,Not only was the casino restaurants and sports bars 5 stars but our guest room was wonderful. The guest room was very clean and the view of the fountain was amazing. My family had the best time. We will be back.
10,No personal assistance with anything check-in at the kiosk is convenient if you don't want to wait in the 2hr line concierge blows up your phone and is a robot so not helpful. You call down to request service and bounced around and cut off. Arrived in room air conditioner not working took 3.5 hrs to get fixed in September 79 degree in room. Coffee machine in room but you have to buy your own coffee down the street they are rude and not helpful with anything. And was charged for a water we never touched.
30,The actual hotel was impressive but when it comes to the hotel room I was not impressed. Stained furniture marks on walls and just worn /outdated looking. What really got me is that housekeeping didn‚Äôt even come until 8 pm because I had to call twice‚Ä¶
10,I was extremely disappointed in the service. Hours long check-in terrible service in my room and charging me for things I didn't use.  Check-in line was really long. For one of the largest hotels in the world why would you only have a handful of agents checking in guests? One of my colleagues said they had a three hour wait to check in.  On my second day housecleaning took away the shampoo I used only once and the tissues I still had and replaced them with...nothing.  I checked out today to find I was charged $11.91 for a Fiji water. Two things stand out here. First $12 for a bottle of water??? Second I didn't touch any of the in-room products! I made a point to not go near them for fear I would get charged for something I didn't take. Yet here we are.
10,Arrived upgraded room to find out you can't even use the fridge in room unless you pay $75. $11 if you want a small water out if the fridge. Don't even touch anything or you will be charged.  Asked for a wine glass was informed they don't have any as a matter of fact had no glass wear. They finally found 2 regular glasses so we could have our wine.  The room was out dated was extremely dusty  lamp shades torn  called down to front desk was told I could come down wait in line again and they would put me in the room I originally was going to have  ugh ! They are trying to recoop $$ after the pandemic. And I still have to pay a resort fee ??? This is no resort what a rip off!
10,I don't know where to begin we check in to a non-smoking room as soon as we step into the room it absolutely wreaks of tobacco we let the front desk know they say they are fully booked and can't change our rooms (even though 1 hour prior they offered us to upgrade to larger room for $50/night) WOOW !! But offer to have cleaning come to our room I say know thats inconvenient don't have them come WHAT DO THEY DO come anyways while we were gone. We come back its 3am we walk into a complete THICK FOG chemical smell nasty smoked out room. Some little machine pumping fog out literally gave you an instant headache! ARE THEY INSANE? So then they are forced to change rooms. 1 night later 4am come back ALL ROOM KEYS DON'T WORK! walk all the way downstairs get new room keys they offer a credit on the account towards food and 1 night of comp stay but it gets worse. We go to use our credit at buffet before catching a flight after the long line get up front to pay NO CREDIT ON ACCOUNT had to go back to front desk have them reinstate what they said they would do. Was absolutely beside myself with this place. We couldn't enjoy our credit couldn't enjoy the buffet missed our flight couldn't get another flight home and literally had to have a friend come back and get us then drive home for 6 hours. HORRENDOUS experience due to Caesars absolutely NOT having there S*** together.
30,Long check in and check out lines. Even with diamond status checking out at 8 am was a disaster. One long line and only two people working at the one and only check in/check out area open. Even though I plan ahead and leave early for the airport I was stressed. Even the app wasn‚Äôt working for a while. They need more customer service help!
20,They tried overcharging me for resort fees by double. My son opened the bedside table drawer to find condoms and an empty wrapper so i question the cleanliness. I requested housekeeping daily but they never showed up until I had to call the front desk. We go to Vegas quite often but we won‚Äôt be staying at Caesar‚Äôs Palace again. They also charge $70 just to use the fridge that‚Äôs already plugged in and running
40,Courteous staff Fast drink service on casino floor due to being able to order from your slot machine. However Forum Tower North rooms are in desperate need of renovations. Overall it is a very pretty casino
10,I‚Äôve been staying at Caesar‚Äôs palace for the past 10 years. It‚Äôs my go to hotel so when I booked a suite for my birthday weekend it not only was one of the most expensive rooms I‚Äôd ever booked in Vegas it was one of the worst. A window that looked to a wall and another window they replaced with a mirror. The safe was locked and couldn‚Äôt be opened remote to TV was busted and a drawer in the bathroom was broken and cut me. When I tried to have a friendly conversation with the manager I was told that if I wanted a nicer room I‚Äôd need to pay more money. This room was already $800 a night yes you heard correctly! When I explained that this was my go-to hotel I was met with a dead pan ‚ÄúWell you booked your room and we don‚Äôt control how it was advertisers online‚Ä¶‚Äù    I will never stay at another Caesar‚Äôs resort. They‚Äôve grown too big and they apparently have no loyalty to their customers. Hope you all support the other Vegas businesses as I will moving forward.
50,We have been to Caesars Palace for the sixth time and this was the first one after 2019.  As usual there was a long line for the check in and we have received a nice efficient and courteous attention this time by Elpidio. We had a reservation for a Petit Suite at Octavius and we were offered an upgrade which we accepted. There was a problem with the keys and Keila from Seven Stars helped us quickly and also nicely. The Executive Suite was excellent with a nice view of the fountains at Bellagio.  The housekeeping was daily performed and the employee Juana was an excellent and nice everyday.  I had a problem with the internet and the technician Bill was efficient and nice to quickly solve it.  The employee Christine at the Rewards counter was also efficient and nice whenever we needed.  We loved the stay and are looking forward our next visit to Las Vegas to stay here again.
30,Stayed at Caesars on 9/9/22 for the beginning of our western vacation. We flew into Vegas on 9/9/22 and will fly out on 9/16/22 and planned to stay at Ballys on that night.  After a very long day flying in from Indiana and a few hours in the casino my wife was exhausted and went to our room around 10:30 PM to go to bed. The room temperature was 78 degrees and even it was cool enough to sleep no sleep would have been possible due to the loud noise from the toilet running.  Long story short the technician was able to cool down the room and replace the flapper on the toilet but it was nearly 12:30 AM.  Very disappointed and wondering how the end of our vacation on 9/16/22 will be.  Very disappointed from Caesars rewards member Brad Cash!!!!
20,We scheduled months in advance to celebrate our anniversary. We had stayed at least 3 times before and were happy. This time nothing of what we asked for was met; A king room a hand shower a view late checkout. We did the online check in at first and the items I chose then were also not accepted. Once we got there the express check in wasn't working so we had to wait in line.    The gentleman who helped was nice although he was very hard to hear. They gave us a double room o view no hand shower no late check out. After a bit of back and forth we were able to upgrade to a king bed he said with a view that ended up being more of a view of a rooftop and partial view of a pool.    The lights were not all workingthe shower was mediocre the toilet you had to push the lever 2-3 times everytime in order for it to flush. One of the 2 sinks was clogged the whole time we were there. The ice machine on our floor was out of order as well.    Was this the trip we were looking forward to? Not in the least. Will we stay at caesars again? I'm not sure. This time was such a let down we will more than likely go someplace else.
10,Booked a pet stay room with 2 beds in Augustis tower 4 months in advance for my birthday. When I got to the hotel they said I'm sorry but augustis is sold out but they put us in a room with one bed . Got to sleep on the couch though . Great service
50,Caesar‚Äôs is amazing and their entire staff treated my guests and I like royalty! I couldn‚Äôt be happier! Yoonhee was so accommodating and helpful she‚Äôs an awesome employee! I truly look forward to our next trip to Las Vegas. We‚Äôre certainly staying at Caesar‚Äôs Palace!
50,Diamond check-in personnel the best! The staff all very helpful and friendly. The food and drinks are off the charts! This is the place to stay in Las Vegas! Yuni at diamond check-in knows how to treat the guests!
40,We live down the road in Escondido and this was the first time staying here at Harrah‚Äôs! We had such a good time! We ate at the Cafe inside the Casino and the Salisbury Steak was delicious and the portions could easily feed two people! We can‚Äôt wait to come back! Everyone was so nice and helpful!
10,Property is beautiful but service at front desk and guest services is the worst we have EVER experienced in 2 decades of travel. Called today to reach maintenance and we were put on hold and then disconnected FOUR times. Never did get a hold of maintenance to unlock the safe that was locked upon arrival. Very long lines everywhere & they are charging for every little extra they can. While the individual employees are very nice the service in general is abysmal.    They have closed 4 of the 7 pools creating a more crowded area and they then charge up to $75 for a pool chair. Beer is $14 in the food court. **Caesars has removed concierge services from ALL Vegas hotels because they do not generate income** BAD FORM CAESARS!!    Wait line to check in averages 2 hours. We are happy to pay top dollar for a great meal but not 3 times a day for 7 days while we are here working. The food court meals we have had are horrible not worth the $20 at ALL. As we have walked around the strip we see 2 hour long check in lines at almost every property. Caesars we have lost all respect for you.
10,We are frequent visitors to Vegas and usually stay at Encore/Wynn but decided to try Caesar‚Äôs Palace as it was closer to the convention center for our business meetings.  Our last day here we had a nice dinner planned and while I was gambling my husband was trying to catch up on sleep and was napping when he was awoken by gurgling in the bathroom. He went in there to see black dirt coming out of the sink and bubbling up. He tried to go back to bed but the plumber who was there to fix the neighbors issue was knocking on our door to come in. They needed to clear everything out of the bathroom and had to go back and forth to the neighbors room and our room so my husband had to throw on a T-shirt and shorts and leave the room for a few hours so it could be dealt with. We had to change dinner plans as we were going to a fairly upscale dining venue and he couldn‚Äôt shower and get ready.  When we talked to the less than helpful manage on duty all she could do or say was ‚ÄúI do apologize‚Äù we can move rooms for you. We didn‚Äôt want to move rooms at 10pm (dealt with after our dinner) on our last night when we have a 5am wake up call. Once again ‚ÄúI do apologize‚Äù was her answer. One would have thought we shouldn‚Äôt have had to pay for the room last night.  Won‚Äôt ever stay here again.  PS we are diamond status and got nothing to show for that!
40,Caesar‚Äôs has the most friendly staff and is very decadent. Eating establishments are first class especially Old Homestead Steakhouse. Slot payouts however are horrible and even on under 2$ bets slots will eat thousands of your dollars a day. Plan to lose all you bring. Not sure why they are so bad. Seems to me a little higher payouts would go a long way. My next trip will be somewhere else.
50,Booked the room at Caesar Palace in Vegas to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary on Labor Day weekend 2022. Check-in was a long line but it was worthy to wait because all the front desk staff are very friendly especially Gemma the front desk staff who was helping me to check in and explaining all the upgrade benefit at the hotel. The room was very nice and cleaned and my room looking down to the pools it's very nice view.    The Buchannal buffet at Caesar Palace is very pricey ($90/person) it's worthy because all seafood you could get dessert all you could eat. The down side is you have to make reservation for the dinner few days in advance before you leave home otherwise you can't get in. I don't think if you could get in without reservation.    Conclusion we will be back to this hotel next year again.
50,Awesome!! Very nice and huge! Great rooms and lots of places to it. Also has a very nice pool with lots of shopping options. The shops are very high end stuff. Lots of things to walk too including Hell‚Äôs Kitchen!
50,I‚Äôve been to Vegas several times but wanted to take my family and Caesar‚Äôs was a great choice. Our check-in was easy and we were upgraded so that we could stay close to each other. The AC in both rooms had issues but the problem was fixed right away and once we spoke with Jasmin the manager she compensated us for the inconvenience. There was a gentleman at concierge that day and he escalated our issue right away which was also greatly appreciated. I‚Äôll definitely be back!
50,"My wife and I took our annual Seven Stars trip to Caesars...8/29 to 9/2. We come to Vegas to Eat - Drink - Gamble. We checked in with KELI of VIP Services. She was EXCELLENT - Professional friendly attentive. So far so good. Our room in the Augustus Tower was fine....same as it has been for the last 15 years we've gone there. Everything was working properly. This hotel is always PACKED so crowds are everywhere. Keep in mind that the ""crowds"" are mainly groups of Gen-Z to Millenials who love to POSE....which group is better looking then the others. It's actually quite comical but that's today's young adults (our future....Yikes!!!). I tipped our housekeeping daily so they were excellent to us. We ate at our favorite restaurants - NOBU (Scott is the BEST Server / Waiter!) - Mr. Chow (never again) and Bugsy Meyer (a great steakhouse). The casino seemed fairly busy most of the time but early morning is best....especially if you love to see the hookers out trying to get them some ""dirty white boys"" (thank you Foreigner!) LOL. Overall it's Caesars as usual. We'll be back."
20,Caesar‚Äôs Palace presents as fancy but in reality it‚Äôs a mess of overlooked flaws fumbles and restrictions. The lifts were old and dirty the bathroom door had significant damage on it they provided a feather pillow to my Dad who has a feather allergy the pool closes at 6 (who closes their pool at 6 anyway?) but in reality the pools start closing around 4:30. The room wifi only allowed 2 devices per room an insanity for the modern age.
50,First time in Vegas. I had really high expectations for Caesars and they were exceeded. I think we got lucky because there was almost no check in queue! We got our room upgraded for free so ended up with a strip view (and a partial pool view) in a large suite which was amazing! Staff were all super helpful. Maids were always great. Room was clean. No issues whatsoever. Would come back in a heartbeat!
20,upon our stay it was very easy to check in and we were delighted to hear we were upgraded to a suite without asking but we did pay for late check out. The only problem was the room we were upgraded to was NOT an upgrade. We were woken up at 2am by construction going on and it didn't stop until 8am. We got absolutely no sleep and when we called for room service the personnel could not understand me and was asking me to spell what I was requesting. NOT something I expect from a 4 star hotel. However my fianc√© and I did attend the spa and buffet both were exceptional and we would do again. The pool staff as well was very helpful just really really disappointed in our room.
20,Hotel was an icon for so many years. Unfortunately quality is gone. Fees are ridiculous. Food was either really good or really bad. Generally dirty everywhere. There are now many better choices to stay in Vegas. Front desk is eager to offer room upgrades for a fee of course and won‚Äôt offer early check-in or check-out without a fee. No job is too big and no fee is too big.
40,First time staying at Caesars thought I would be impressed with their rooms but it was a disappointment. Their rooms are like staying at a motel or cheaper hotel that lacks amenities. Aside from that the room that was given to us by the front clerk was run down. Yes it had pool view but a long walk to get to our room. Also the bar fridge kept making noise.
50,My stay was great no complains whatsoever the room was clean the bathroom was clean provided everything needed to be comfortable. Prices were a little high but it was worth it!!!! Will be back soon!!
50,Amazing Augustus Tower Room with a beautiful view. We had a great time looking all over and playing tables and slots. Also the checkin host Yunie was so friendly and helpful. We definitely will come back and stay here next time.
50,A Diamond Plus member for the last couple of years and just have a chance to book an Augustus tower room. Thanks to Yunie at the Diamond registration desk for the room with a fantastic view of the Bellagio fountain. The room is very spacious with a living room and a luxurious bathroom.
40,this stay was with my company convention. checkin early was ok before the heavy rush and lucky we had diamond status otherwise early checkin would've cost us. the complex itself is good as a result of it being central located. they have a massive shop mall area in the basement food courts and lots of restaurants. pool is good though i did not use this trip. the slot machines are a old mixed with new. we got a decent 2 queen room with decent size and ok view.
30,I was really excited to get back to Las Vegas after the Covid issues and booked a couple of nights at the iconic Ceasars Palace. I booked a standard room and arrived at 1pm I was advised that to check-in at that time I would need to pay an extra $50 for early check-in. Outrageous! I felt like it was a shake down after a desk manager came over and waived the fee and I was also given an upgrade. I was pleased that this issue was handled in this way. It was a very nice size room but the room was very dated and damaged it had been very well used. I was also disappointed that the hotel does not allow guests to use the big pools without paying very large fees they charge to use the chairs and you need a reservation.
20,Caesars Palace would be 5star if it wasn't for the terrible experience we had checking in!! Be prepared to wait for at least a couple of hours & to be confused & to feel like you aren't totally sure what was & wasn't an up-charge... sad it starts that way!!
10,We had lot of expectation from our 2 night's stay in Caesar's but it turned out to be a big disappointment. First of all the check-in process is long and tedious. The line itself is not very welcoming and they had limited number of staff to help out a 100 odd people standing in the line to check in. The express checkout process is broken. I guess this problem is everywhere in Las Vegas hotels on the strip so may be we have to deal with it. Secondly we had booked 2 rooms. They were not able to give us any room on a same floor  forget about next to each other or connecting rooms. The front desk literally forced us to upgrade which added 350$ extra to put us on the same tower but different floors. We also had a king and 2 queens but had to settle for both rooms as 2 queens. We repeatedly said we had a senior citizen and two kids but they gave us rooms all the way in the end which made walking up and down very difficult. I tried calling them multiple times to change but to no avail. The check-in process took about 1.5 hours and then finally we reached our rooms. We found someone's used lens in the jacuzzi - yuckss . Called guest services but they did nothing except verbal apologies. The mini bar had stuff missing and when I called to report they said that there were 3 different charges for the mini bar already. I had to spend another 30 mins to explain that those charges should be disputed. Thankfully it finally did. The food court is more pricy than the restaurants. Staff at Pronto charged for hot water. Overall attitude of the staff is not friendly or welcoming and hospitality was negative. It seems they don't care anymore for guests as long as their casinos are running. Extremely disappointed. Pool and our buffet dinner at Bacchanal was very good.
10,In Vegas for conference. Checked in on Thursday September 1 2022 at approximately 2:30pm. Returned to hotel just after 1am the morning of Friday September 2 and key cards (both) would not work to access the elevator to the 64th floor (Octavius Tower). Went to front desk and all six key card duplication machines are off (Turned off at 11pm I am later told) so am forced to stand in the check-in line to get a duplicate key card. After about 20 mins when the realization dawns that the line is upwards of an hour long I left the line and approached one of the check-in employees. I told her that I simply needed a duplicate key card and was not in line to check in and was rebuffed. She said she could not help me. I returned to the line and waited to speak to someone. After about 50 mins (total) in line I finally spoke to a check-in person who told me I should have been in a different line for preferred patrons which I was not told about. I was handed two new key cards and again tried to go to my room. Again neither key card would work to access the elevator to the 64th floor. Went back to front desk where they finally found a security guard to accompany me and we were able to access an elevator which did not require a key card and I was able to access my floor and my room. I lost 90 minutes trying to access my room late at night because Caesar's does not have a simple way to get a duplicate key card. Needles to say I was so frustrated with them I cancelled the remainder of my three day stay
30,The hotel was beautiful but I was shocked when maintenance came to the door asking if I put in a work order for a leaking toilet. Turns out a maid had requested the toilet to be fixed before we checked in. The maintenance worker ended up having to come in during our stay and take off the toilet and reseal it. Why would they even allow us to check out that room? Luckily we were hardly in the room so it didn‚Äôt bother us too much but still kind of an inconvenience.
30,The room had some dinged up furniture and no usable refrigerator as it was totally filled with buy only items. Their was some loud construction in the hotel that woke us up way too early two out of the three mornings we were there. I notified the concierge both times but nothing was done. The pools were nice!
20,We stayed in the Octavius tower. Our room was an ADA room which we did not request but it‚Äôs okay. The shower still had someone else‚Äôs hair on the floor including a decent size hairball outside of the shower. ONLY 2 ELEVATORS WERE WORKING!!! There were times where we waited close to 10 minutes just to get on the elevator. The buffet was good but soooo expensive. We paid almost $200 for 2 people. Only 1 elevator in the parking garage was working so that took a while as well. Other than that the people who helped us out (check in person buffet workers pool bartenders) were very nice. Time to move on to other hotels.
20,I‚Äôve been to Vegas 5 X and never have I been treated so rudely upon checking in.  It wasn‚Äôt just Caesars that had rude snippy staff. I experienced it everywhere in vegas. there were exceptions along the way but it happened enough places that I doubt I‚Äôll be back to vegas again. Big turn off and quite frankly ruins the quality of your experience.    Pros and cons of caesars    Pros -  Location on the strip  Nice pools - except they keep closing most of them so they aren‚Äôt available  Spacious rooms  Comfortable bed    Cons  Very very rude check in staff  Expensive food and drink  Found women‚Äôs underwear on the bathroom floor from previous guest  Smokey smell in the lobby and casino  Expect to pay tax on top of the already criminal resort fee they charge    See ya Vegas. You used to be fun but I‚Äôll spend my hard earned money somewhere else where they care about their guests.
50,End of August 2022. My wife and I were wondering where to go for the short break. Hearing of Harrahs Rincon from friends we decided to book 2 nights at the said place. My! We had fun the food was good the people especially the staff were hospitable it was a taste of paradise after the 2 years pandemic and other problems everybody just faced. Kudos and congratulations to Harrahs Rincon employees staff and management for a well run place! More power to all and God bless you and yoir families!
40,Over all my experience at this property was very good. I did however run into a few snags. Upon entering our room it wasn‚Äôt very clean. Hair was in the shower and the sheets on the bed look as if they were just thrown back on. Not wanting to complain we let it be. I would like to comment on how friendly the staff are. Always a smiling face. Being our first time in Vegas it was nice to see some friendly faces and feel welcome.
10,We got a room for the night in the Palace tower: a king suite with strip view. When we got to check in we got a free 'upgrade' to a slightly larger room with 2 full bathrooms instead of one yet lost our booked strip view for Pool view. Room was hot at 80 degrees F when we entered and had to crank up AC!!! Took one hour to cool down and still never felt cooler than about 75 degrees F.  Bed ok for comfort in terms of mattress but bed sheets very rough. It was very obvious that the sheets were cheap and literally uncomfortable. Pillows terrible with zero neck support and complete 'mush'. Comforter on top of bed had more support!!!  Not having a strip view was extremely disappointing and new room nothing to write home about with exception of extra bathroom ( we did not need it!) so did not feel like upgrade to us especially after losing strip view. I can understand a suite upgrade but this was not it! We literally got the same room with an extra bathroom and lost a strip view and quite frankly I'd rather have one less bathroom for two people with a strip view. The person behind customer service/counter was obviously clueless because if you're going to upgrade make it a fabulous suite and not just some thing as ridiculously pathetic as this. The room we originally booked was perfect.  Valet parking here is $50!!! We self parked and walked to reception in lobby.. it was a lot of walking.  Overall experience meh. Way better places to stay at on strip.  Finally we checked in at 8:30pm. We left at 11:53 pm... why? Horrible sheets and pillows... could not sleep. Luckily we are locals so went home to sleep in our own beds that are comfortable with quality sheets and pillows. Will not be planning to stay at this hotel again. Complete thumbs down.  I also have to say that when I called to check out the next day as the monitors were not working for check out the evening that we left the operator literally could not care less that we had a negative experience and never took down any information or even transferred me to anyone. This does not bode well for Caesars Palace no more all of its hotels and we will be trying to MGM because we've always had great experiences with that chain.  Horrible experience and would never ever try this place again.
10,I must admit Caesars architecture and rich historical themes are beautiful. But that is where it ends. The place is dingy and dirty smelling like a pit of smokers. You have to pay for parking and I hope you are inclined to walk because the parking garage is far away from your room. Plus only one parking garage worked so I hope you like waiting for 15 minutes. Everything is over priced. They don't have a lot of casino table games and the minimum is 25 instead of 15 like the Cromwell. Customer service is terrible and rude and this has to be the first time where I have to keep asking a company to take their money out of my account. I give Caesars like people getting overdraft fees from spending money that is theirs that they refuse to take out like other reasonable companies would. Oh our shower was clogged too. Point blank don't stay HERE. Spend a little more and stay the Venetian the Bellagio MGM or at your friend's house when you come here.
50,This was the most exhilarating experience we've had in a long time. The Aguster suite was the most beautiful I've seen and the staff knows hospitality. The weather was perfect in spite of the rain. We can't wait to visit again!!! That's it!!!
40,We stayed at Caesars Palace for 3 nights comped in August. We are Caesars Rewards Diamond members and thankfully got to check in in a special area for diamond members. I say this because the line at the regular check in was literally insane at times. Daniel checked us in and he was fantastic. I had originally booked a Palace king room but ended up in an Augustus fountain view room!    The hotel itself is quite massive this is no surprise to anyone who has been to Vegas. I find it fairly easy to navigate. I would say the Augustus tower is definitely the easiest tower to get in/out of in this resort. Didn't feel like we were trekking through the hotel to find our room! They did have some renos ongoing at the time which made the casino floor layout a bit disjointed.    The reason I gave our stay 4* is that I feel the room overall was a little beaten up. The room itself is large nicely appointed and was spotless. It's just you can tell some of the furniture is getting old and is banged up - it was quite noticeable in areas like the dresser/credenza. That view though wow!! It totally made up for any imperfections.    The bed was absolutely amazing. I know this is subjective but I find CET hotels have the best beds and this one at Caesars Palace delivered. We had no issues with noise water pressure or water temperature. I did notice that we did not get any housekeeping during our stay - I did call one night for towels and to have the garbage emptied and they came quite quickly.    The pool area is gorgeous. We went quite early and just took some photos so didn't see the pool in full action but it's large with lots of choices for everyone. Some areas you had to rent a spot to gain access to the particular pool.    I am glad I had the opportunity to stay at Caesars Palace. The size wouldn't deter me from staying here again. You definitely find your way. Crossing over to the LINQ promenade is quick if you are wanting more reasonable priced eats. The forum shops attached is also a nice addition.    Very enjoyable stay!
50,Jeanie at the front desk made our first impression of Caesar Palace off to a great start with a warm welcome so thank you jeanie ! The Caesar palace is a great location and the establishment is beautiful !
50,Really enjoyed the Julius tower. We were happy with how close the hotel was to everything. Pools and bed and shower and dining options were great. Staff were friendly. Room was very clean. I think this is our new favourite trumping Mirage and MGM
50,"We flew in late Friday night and upon checking in our room was upgraded! We were staying 4 nights so we were excited that we got this amazing corner suite with a living area huge bathroom closet nooks desk table and chairs and our very own doorbell! Eeek! It was so spacious and perfect for our stay!  We had a later in the day flight out on Tuesday and Keli at VIP services was AMAZINGLY kind and generous and let us stay in our room until 3:00 pm. We were able to hang out at the pool one last time and still able to shower and pack up before heading to airport.  We love Caesar's Palace! My husband is a Diamond member and the comp and perks are soooo nice! We enjoyed eating at The Bacchanal Buffet Americano Bobby Flay Burger and the pizza in the food court is so good! We even had night caps at Vanderpump Cocktail Garden. All were wonderful experiences ‚ù§Ô∏è  The service cleanliness quality and accessibility to everything is what we love about Caesar's!    Cons: everyone saves chairs at the pool early with their towels.  It cost me $16.25 for a diet Pepsi and a ""tap"" water as they call it. ü§™ I would have loved to have drinks by the pool but literally will not pay $25 for a Pina Colada. Not that I couldn't ""afford"" it it's seriously highway robbery.    We really hate that they fill the mini fridge with VERY OVERPRICED snacks and drinks. We had no where to store left overs or our own drinks. We literally took our trash can filled it with ice then filled up one of the bathroom sinks to keep our drinks cold.  They also have a spread of snacks and water that are weight sensitive and will charge you if you barely touch anything.    Everything is out of control expensive but we still enjoyed our stay and chose what to spend our money on."
10,Would have been nice if the staff were friendlier‚Ä¶..when we were checking out the young lady was quite rude to me and my wife cleaning staff and waitresses were great food was very expensive but good‚Ä¶.been to Vegas several times and we won‚Äôt be back to Caesars
20,Check-in was very slow (2.5 hours in line); directions to the room were very bad; room was incorrect when we finally made it there and it was never fixed; we had a difficult time getting the proper supplies in the room (no coffee cups more toilet paper towels etc.); the bathroom was very nice except the toilet paper holder was gone.
50,We checked into Cesars Palace for our honeymoon. Sadly there were some room issues. Dwight - front desk manager- MADE IT RIGHT! No questions excuses or compromises. He upgraded us immediately to the next best room which to our amazement was the Augustus Suite. Perfect view of the Bellagio fountains and the strip. Dwight - you are a rock star!
50,I visit vegas more than 5 times per year I always stay in caesars palace! The best location and clean hotel in the strip I can gamble to different casino within 10min.  Yuni from Diamomond registration is nice and friendly.
50,I had a lot of different items That needed to be accomplished at the Diamond Check in. They were amazing‚Ä¶.Anna was amazing! I had to make multiple trips and each time I was treated with professionalism.
10,This place should be nuked. Some of staff and the owning company are awful. Some of the staff were all pleasent to your face but actually wouldn't help you at all with even simple requests.  The staff have no idea what is even present in their hotel.  The staff have zero interest in helping with simple requests (that every other 3/4/5 star hotel would help you with)  The hidden (probably illegal) charges are insane. Want to use a nice lounger by the Pool $50. Want to swim after 7pm $$$'s. Want to put a bar of chocolate in the fridge $75!! (yes you read that correct)    This place is a soulness capitilist materialist nightmare. The whole hotel and most of Vegas should be nuked.    Go stay somewhere nice in Europe instead.
20,Caesar's Las Vegas is truly going downhill. It is like a carnival cruise ship with neoclassical d√©cor that is falling apart. The property is truly massive but not well-staffed. It took an hour to check in at 8:00 in the morning. The hotel had two people working the front desk with 30 people in line. As I approached the property there were no bellhops to be found or open a door. On the western side of the property a lingering sulfur smell emanates the air and it is not pleasant. I stayed in the Octavius tower which looked much better online than in person. My bed had tears on the headboard and the furniture was in bad condition. Room service is on an annoying app instead of being able to call someone and it is not user-friendly. One of the best things about staying in a luxury hotel is being able to order room service easily and having it presented like a fine dining restaurant. Covid is not an excuse to make cost cuts when the prices are the same or higher. I will say the best part of the hotel is the Pool area. Mitchell and Tamra were amazing and were the best part of the hotel experience. The pool staff and amenities of the pool were the only redeeming quality of this resort. Rome is falling while Caesar‚Äôs entertainment plays the fiddle.
50,Very hot time of year love the 5 different pools. Room was absolutely perfect!! Lobby is clean with easy access to the Strip and walking distance to everything! Front desk was very friendly and so were the servers.
30,Caesar‚Äôs charges you $75 to use the room refrigerator. We had coffee creamer we needed to keep cold. Charged $75 on our bill. Ridiculous to be so petty at nice place like Caesar‚Äôs. We moved a beer bottle to make room for a water bottle in fridge and got charged. Never drank room alcohol at all and got charged by the censors in room refrigerator . Another ridiculous nickel and dime charge. Shame on you Caesar‚Äôs ! Pools on property were beautiful at Caesar‚Äôs.
10,Please read before before you book a room with Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.  I have stayed at Caesars multiple times and this is my first stay since it‚Äôs change ownership. I was there for four nights and just checked out today.  Most of the staff were very helpful and I would like to give a big thanks to Ralfie and Rae at the front desk and Mitchell at the pool. They were very friendly and their customer service was 5 star.  My first day there they had one of the pools closed and there were no chairs available at the other pool so I sat on the pavement. So the next day I paid 40 dollars to ensure I had a chair. Mitchell was very helpful and always checking to see if I need anything.    Now if you need to speak to the front desk but you can‚Äôt because the lines are so long dont do what I did. I tried using the option on their app that says front desk. That routes you to an offshore call center. I called at least 12 times and spent 33 minutes trying to talk to a staff member on-site ‚Ä¶ I was never able to speak to a staff member that was onsite. I just gave up and finally went and stood in line for about 25 minutes.    Their customer service is unfortunately not what is use to be. The staff onsite when encountered were very helpful.    I could mention more but I think I covered enough for you to be cautious when considering to stay at Caesar‚Äôs.
30,This is our second time this year booking a particular room and getting a less desirable one. No apologies or refunds were offered. Per guest services ‚Äúwe are fully booked and there is nothing we can do for you‚Äù. If they offered a free something like late checkout or bottled water their service reputation may have been rescued. Unfortunately a brazen nothing is unacceptable.
50,I always stay at Caesar‚Äôs Palace when in Las Vegas. They have great service great restaurants and easy access to the Strip. I live the Forum Shops and restaurants. Usually reasonably priced. Always great entertainment. The best place to stay in Vegas!
10,I‚Äôll keep this short. We didn‚Äôt get the rooms we were promised when booking months in advance. Then we had sewage shooting out of our sinks onto our stuff. Didn‚Äôt receive any sympathy from the resort
20,We booked the Palace Premium Studio 2 Queen Non-Smoking (Newly Renovated). The room comes with two toilets. In the main bathroom there is a bidet. The bidet stunk so bad that the toilet in that room could not be used. We had to keep it shut the entire time so that we did not smell sewage and odors. I asked the maid if there was a spray that I could use and she handed me a product. I said the bidet smells and she says yes they all do. Walking down the hallway to the elevators with retail shops on both sides all smelled like sewage. Riding down the elevator with another couple I asked him if they smelled sewage and they said yes and they could smell it in their room as well. Like the other reviews I got charged for something in the mini bar that I did not use. Not worth the effort to get get $11 back. I read the reviews regarding the check in process fortunately there were only 20 people in front of me when I checked down. The room that I had reserved on Hotels.com did not provide me with a pool view. I did not get charged extra but I did have to wait. They said the room would be ready between 4 PM and 6 PM however they paged me 20 minutes later and I was able to check into the room. Overall the room was satisfactory. The sewage smell and the air-conditioning not keeping up with the heat outside was an issue as well. The walk-through shower accessible from both bathrooms was a bonus. We also took a bath in the air Jacuzzi bathtub which was fabulous.
20,Overall the front desk staff was not helpful at all we had an issue where the air conditioning wasn‚Äôt working properly. We spent the majority of our trip working with the front desk to fix the issue ultimately after the third time waiting in line for over an hour we were given another room but told we only had 30 minutes to make the move. Just overall really not helpful or friendly the rooms were outdated as well.
30,Had an amazing time in Vegas and had a great time exploring Cesar‚Äôs palace! The only down side was that we booked one king sized bedroom in the forum tower but was given two queens in the Julius tower and when we asked the guest services she said that if we read the fine print the room option is just a preference and they do not have any king size rooms and if we want we will have to $56 extra a night so we decided to make the two queen room work just kinda sucked though given we where there for our 10th anniversary and the employees just didn‚Äôt seem to care also the phone in the room we stayed in did not work and I told them that and they said they will bring one up but never did.  Overall Vegas was amazing! Cesar casino and property was beautiful but the way they the run the front desk and treat guest was poor in my opinion
10,Let‚Äôs start with the $35 dollar charge for early check in‚Ä¶.we got in at 10am so it was worth it or so I thought. It was 2:35 when our room was ready and it took 45 minutes to get our keys. Check in is at 4‚Ä¶ I reserved 3 rooms together‚Ä¶.one room wasn‚Äôt ready until 5:30 but they could get in now (a better room) for a $40 up charge‚Ä¶the other was ready at 3:45‚Ä¶still was told it was before 4 and the charge remained. See the condition of the rooms we got‚Ä¶I‚Äôm posting pictures. None of us were together either. They separated us. Every bad review is true- no coffee and you have to pay an exorbitant price for pods don‚Äôt touch the mini bar or garbage they offer because they are metered and you can be charged for holding them too long‚Ä¶we didn‚Äôt have all of our crap for the bar and I took pictures and told the concierge- a charge still showed up for the missing stuff. My friends had a bunch of issues - from the hotel screwing up the reserved pool area to a boutique making my friend feel like crap about her eye care‚Ä¶We will never go back.
30,It‚Äôs Caesar‚Äôs Palace so there is a level of splendor and excess that is cool to experience. Don‚Äôt let that fool you though. There‚Äôs more than a little Motel 6 in its DNA.    Pros: check-in was smooth. I booked with a budget rate and even received a free upgrade to get me in a room a few minutes early. The room was spacious and had a pleasing courtyard view overlooking the multiple opulent pools. The bathroom was ridiculously large. The spa is luxurious.    Cons: the room showed wear-and-tear: a small hole in the shower signs of water damage around the base of the bathroom doors scratches and scuffs. In a hotel with 4000 rooms I understand.    What‚Äôs easier to control: the broken system of upcharges for the simplest things and the challenges this poses for the staff. The spa experience was $65 just to use the facility for three hours (there are free tea pretzels and oranges though!). This was marginally acceptable but didn‚Äôt seem like much of a ‚Äúguest pass‚Äù rate.    The minibar is a terrible scam. I‚Äôm an accountant so I get pricing structures and such but this is broken.    The most egregious gouges are the ‚Äúcoffee kit‚Äù and ‚Äúintimacy kit‚Äù that are boxed up so you can‚Äôt even see what you‚Äôre getting. There‚Äôs a Keurig but you have to bring your own K cups sweetener cream AND stirrers if you don‚Äôt want to purchase the coffee kit.    I arrived in my room to find a few items missing from the minibar. I did research ahead (note: guests should not have to perform investigations of hotel properties in advance to avoid being cheated) and knew there were sensors on the minibar that determined charges so if you even need to check the ingredients on an item to see if you want it‚Äîbam $11. Still I took pics of what was there.    When I checked out there were $55 in minibar charges dated when those missing items were stocked by the attendant. That‚Äôs problematic.  Because of this I spent an extra half hour in the hotel at reception waiting to resolve. The reception staff member was irritated by my issue because there are no doubt guests who don‚Äôt follow the no-touching rule or outright try to get free stuff. But for someone in my position it just read as poor customer service. She shoved a corrected folio receipt at me without explaining what she had done. It appears she was so upset she could not even utter the words ‚ÄúI removed the charges.‚Äù    It‚Äôs noteworthy that I received far superior service at the hole-in-the-wall 24 hour Subway across the street at midnight the previous night.
10,Our entire stay at Caesar's was a disaster. We arrived to check in and the line was over an hour long. We were directed to the Express Check-In (which took just as long as the regular check-in line because none of the kiosks were functional). We had paid for a Premium Room with two queen beds in the Octavius Tower. We were given a King Room in the Forum Tower. The room stank of smoke and the decor had obviously not been updated since the 80s. None of the lights or outlets worked. The curtains didn't open. We tried to call down to the front desk to remedy the situation but the phones didn't work either. We hoofed it back down and stood in line (again) to get the room situation resolved. We were finally moved to the Premium Room with 2 queens in the Octavius Tower. That room was also problematic. The shower leaked all over the tile/marble floor. My friend slipped hard and hurt himself on the bathroom floor. The bathtub had not been cleaned half the lights and outlets in the room were non-functional. Only 1 USB port in a room for 4 adults? 3 towels for 4 people? Caesar's looks nice on the outside but it's a mess on the inside. I expected more especially for the price. Would never stay there again.
40,This is a beautiful hotel and casino. The decor is exactly what you‚Äôd expect from a place called Caesar‚Äôs Palace.    Definitely plan a few 100 dollars more than you‚Äôve paid though.    The website lists checkin as 4. When we turned up at 4:15 we were told our room wasn‚Äôt ready and it was actually 4-6. We had 5:15 dinner reservations so this was no good. Their best solution was for us to upgrade our 2 rooms for 50 dollars each. We did.    Even sitting in the bulk of the pool chairs has a price.    That said it is a lovely place. Come but plan to spend and then some if you want to have a good time.    Also bring body wash. They have shampoo conditioner and lotion but just bar soap.
50,Caesar‚Äôs palace is so big and classy it is amazing. My family and I only seen half of it in the three days we stayed. The highlights were the pools and restaurants there. Would stay there again. Service was all first class and made you feel special and appreciated.
50,I was concerned prior to going after reading the reviews. I just returned from a three day trip Fri Sat and Sun. We arrived at 4:30 on Friday and used the kiosks to get room keys. I was able to retrieve mine right away. My friend put her info in and told her to see an attendant. You have to present the credit card you booked the reservation with. Her card was the same number but had been updated in the month before our trip so it was technically not the card she had originally booked with. I very nice lady helped her by updating her credit card info and we were on our way. We were staying in the Octavius tower. The rooms were very nice my friend on 64 floor and I on the 63. We hoped to be on the same floor but it was fine meeting at the bottom when we were going somewhere. The rooms were comfortable the linens very nice and we both brought our own coffee K cups to use in the kuerig machine in the morning. We bought the little creamers too. So no fuss to have your morning cup. Food and Beverages are expensive so be prepared! But I will say everywhere we ate was delish! We enjoyed our stay had no problems the staff all seemed professional in our encounters. We checked out using the check-out feature on the tv. Everything went well and we enjoyed our stay. I even got a hand pay in the casino! I would definitely stay again! There is a lot of walking required when in this hotel so if mobility is an issue I would either be prepared with a cart or stay at a smaller hotel Caesars has quite a few in the area close by.
40,The restaurants and other amenities of this hotel are spectacular although in my mind expensive but worth it. However truth be told I don‚Äôt like the feeling that I have to check everything pricewise and all the hidden fees on everything before purchasing something. I don‚Äôt like the feeling of being stung. Bed was very comfortable. Standard safe but a little small if you come with a lot of valuables. Even though we tipped the room cleaning staff each day the room did not get cleaned our last day there. I‚Äôm sure some of this relates to my inexperiences this was the first time I have gone to Vegas.
20,As others have noted one pays extremely high prices for everything. The daily resort fee buys you nothing. Room service is via an APP for restaurants in hotel with surcharges for delivery. Housekeeping skipped our room one day and we had to call multiple times for service. There was a Keurig coffee maker in room but given no k-cups. Need to purchase . Room furnishings are getting worn. On a positive note we did check in via kiosk ‚Ä¶. Had to pay $62 more to check in at 3:00 pm versus at 4:00 pm. Another rip off.
20,I expected so much more from this hotel. Checking in between the automated system and the front desk was a nightmare. Our room was ready but we received no notification. The room was warm since the air conditioning didn't work properly even though I spoke to two managers about it. No follow-up nothing. I gave up at that point. The wifi was terrible and so was the service when I called about it. It was down for two days (no compensation) and when it was working it was weak. Customer service is geared toward the high rollers not the rest of us. With so many other choices in Vegas I definitely won't be back to Ceasar's Palace.
30,To expensive for quality is something I though I would never say about Caesars Las Vegas... I guess COVID and everything else that has happened can bring down a ledged over time. I won't be staying here again unless I have to for business and its paid for until it changes back to the once proud establishment it once was. One quick example... $150 to valet park for 3 nights... 30 minute wait to get my truck back after checking out... Valet attendant expected a tip on top of it and gave me a look when I was not excited about the service... Yep... Welcome to the new Vegas apparently oh and everything is 10 times more expensive on top of the crappy service.
20,The line was horrible in the hotel lobby if you needed a live person. The hotel charges $50 daily access fees. The hotel charges $20 for room coffee kits. You do not get any room coffee k cups for free. Made me feel like I was treated like a Kmart Shopper due to the pettiness of the hotel. Room was ran down. No tub only shower. I will never stay at that dump again.
30,8/14/22  The public areas are clean . The Palace Premium Suite clean neat and orderly. We liked the layout with alot of room and two separate baths joined by a walk in shower.  I requested housekeeping for our visit. After returning to the room on Monday we found housekeeping did not change the sheets. I made a call by using the housekeeping button on the phone. I reached a woman in the Philippines who told me someone would return to change the sheets. The next day I ran into the same housekeeper in the room . She didn't change the sheets or pillow cases again. I brought that to her attention and left. I returned later to find she changed only the sheets . Why ? What`s the problem ? It wasn`t worth another call to the Philippines.  What I learned from this visit :  -This property has NO CONCIERS DESK. And a call for guest services goes DIRECTLY to the Philippines ! As does housekeeping. How stupid is this ?  - There are NO outside tour representatives in the hotel and no tour buses that stop there. If you want information on tours you are on your own. My request was information on Big Bus Tours  -Early check-in after 12 is 55.00 and reduced each hour until 4pm  -Poolside thick cushioned chairs & cabanas are available for a fee. Thursday-Sunday is night swim from 7-1 am. YOU MUST pay a fee for poolside chairs. Two chairs cost 166.00  _ If you go and want to get FEE`D to death I would suggest use the self check-in. It will save time . I anticipate soon they will put a FEE on that to.
50,The resort was conveniently located on the strip and had many restaurants worth visiting in it. The staff we interacted with were friendly. We had a room on the 16th floor in the palace tower. It was spacious quiet clean and comfortable. I loved the deep soaking tub and there was plenty of hot water for it. The only negative is the resort was smoky on the casino floor and the air conditioning in the room could have been colder. Regardless we enjoyed our stay in Caesar‚Äôs and were happy choosing them for our stay.
10,This hotel is a cheat! They denied checkin on the spot saying your card is not acceptable for security deposit even though it was a Visa Multi Currency Forex Card which I used everywhere during my US trip. They refused to refund the money and instead said I should book a lower category room with them at triple the price paying only cash. They will accept double security deposit in cash and give me the room. I had arrived at night and was stranded because of this and had to take the cash offer. They said they will refund the amount but when I contacted make my trip they said hotel is refusing refund since I had completed the booking. I lost the full amount. Wont recommend anyone to book a room here just roam around the hotel for free if you wanna see the italian themed architecture.
50,Stayed in the Augustus Towers. Nice spacious room with a view of the Bellagio fountains. Bathroom was huge with a walk in shower and jet tub. Bed was comfortable and there was multiple places to eat and drink.
40,Phone to the room did not work  Hotel was very nice and shows were awesome next Time we are going to a CLUB IN THE HOTEL  SWIMMING POOL is amazing plenty to do want to know if we are getting points for our next trip ( in DECEMBER )
10,The hotel itself is beautiful but the way its managed is horrid... We stayed here 1 night booked 2 rooms drove 1 car & were charged for 2 parking spaces. The overpriced snack bar in the rooms have sensors so if you pick it up to look at it it is automatically charged to your account. The pools do not have enough free seating for everyone that goes so if you get there at peak time you either have to lay on the floor or pay $120 for the cushioned pool chairs. The checking & checkout lines are also extremely long & there is a limit to 2 devices per room that are allowed to connect to wifi anything after that is a charge of $15.    Might be better if you go as a couple but definitely not anything more than 2 people
10,When staying at Caesars Palace hotel and exploring all that Las Vegas has to offer be sure to know that should someone in your group become lost without a cell phone on them this hotel will do absolutely nothing to help find them. Including not being able to call the very phone in the room you‚Äôre staying in to see if they made their way back.    Instead when you contact guest services you‚Äôll be on hold and offered to buy upgrades/ tickets to shows/ restaurant bookings/ gambling deals before speaking to someone who gives you the number for local police non emergency services so you can file a missing persons report.  I repeat: I simply wanted to call the room I was paying to stay in to check on the safety of my partner.  If you‚Äôre traveling with someone who has special needs this is particularly dangerous as this hotel provides zero duty of care for paying guests. Just know that.  It‚Äôs incredibly easy to get lost in Vegas even within the Caesars Palace hotel and they will do literally nothing to help you.  I contacted the hotel immediately after staying there for them to let me know that they would update their guest safety policy to at least include the ability to phone your own room and they never got back to me. They instead suggest you write a review on TripAdvisor so here I am.    I‚Äôm sure people will stay here despite this review as it‚Äôs very famous but just know this hotel has zero duty of care for it‚Äôs guests and be very careful to not have to rely on them to help in any way whatsoever. Because they‚Äôll take your money but simply won‚Äôt help.    I guess all those camera‚Äôs are for spotting gambling cheats but can‚Äôt be used to find an actual missing person.
10,First off the front desk managers did what they could to help us but were still limited in their capacity. Second DO NOT stay in any of the Octavius suites they are supposed to be a higher premium room but they are truly run down..    There is definitely a theft ring going on with all the staff members. We always opt out of housekeeping and always have the do not disturb sign hanging on the door. We left our room around 3pm came back around 10:30pm and found a blue glove on the floor the same ones that the staff uses. My wife noticed that some of her cash was missing along with a credit card. It looks like they tried using the credit card at a Ross but we were able to reverse the transaction and cancel the card.    We filed a report with security who took the evidence that was left behind but did not tell us to call LVPD to file a report. Between the day shift security and night shift security we were given such a runaround that we had to call LVPD to file a report.    Here's why I know there is theft ring with the staff members. They could have taken all our jewelry laptops iPads etc. But if. you only skim a couple hundred dollars here and there from each room then no one would notice because you're in Vegas. They messed up by leaving evidence behind and taking the credit card. Here's another reason why I know there's a theft ring there was no urgency from Security's end who took the evidence and did not advise us to call LVPD to file a report. It got to the point where we were double locking our suit case and had to hide it behind the curtains. So our entire trip weekend was ruined and they did not comp us for our stay.    It's been a week after the incident and no one from Caesar's has contacted me. I have called and left several messages emails yet nothing.
20,Travelling as a family of 5 (kids 252219) Booked two rooms asking for them to be close to each other. On arrival @ 16:00 found rooms were in different towers & only one was available . Front desk was swamped so we used an e-kiosk. Valet & baggage service worked well & room was fine. Fridge was ‚Äúmove something & you pay‚Äù which doesn‚Äôt help if you diabetic & need to keep medicine chilled.    It all went wrong with the second room. After waiting till 18:00 I went down to the front desk with my wifes passport as she had made the booking. The concierge would not accept the wifes passport as proof of booking or the fact I was listed as an occupant & my credit card used to confirm the second room - even though I secured the first room with it. He insisted she present herself with her credit card.    Pulled my wife back from a shopping trip - met a much more helpful concierge who got us another room in the same tower. However this wasted 90mins of our time on vacation. I get being cautious but this was just stupid bureaucracy.    Made us late for our show (Ka) & really put a crimp in the day. Bad customer service.
10,I recently stayed at Ceasers palace. My room was not ready when I got there. I waited 3 hours and it was still not ready. I was told that I would have to wait 3 or more hours to get into my room or I could upgrade to a larger room. I requested the larger room with a upgrade fee. When I went to the room I found out that it was smaller than what I was supposed to have in the beginning. I went back to the check in desk and asked for the original room but I was told that it was no longer available. They would not wave any fees even though I told them what happened. Upon checking out I again told them what happened and I was given the runaround. They sent me from person to person and finally told me that a front desk supervisor by the name of Veronica would call me. No one called me and the charged me. For everything and even resort fees that they should not have.
40,Lovely spacious room great bathroom. Helpful staff and nice toiletries. Good variety of eateries and a great position for all the fun the strip has to offer. Would definitely recommend and make a return visit.
10,Line to check in was 1.5 hours long. They gave my room away and they had to upgrade me for one night forcing me to do a room change DURING a conference I was supposed be attending. This meant I had to check out and check back in AGAIN. Another 2 hours wasted standing in line walking back and forth to and from the conference and moving which wasted 3.5 hours in total due to the hotel's mistakes. This entire process was not as streamlined as they made it out to be taking additional time away from the conference I paid to attend. I will never stay at a Caesar's Entertainment managed hotel again.  Out of six elevators only two were operational causing a bottle neck when leaving for the conference in the morning.
10,I travel to Vegas twice a year for work. My most recent stay at Caesars (August 2022) was not a great one. First our room was not available at the checkin time. We had received a text that the room was ready and when we went to finish checking in we were told that it was not ready. They did end up switching the rooms to an upgrade which was appreciated especially since we did not ask for it.    We accidentally locked ourselves out of our room on one of the days and had to wait for over an hour for security to come up to the room since our ID's and keys were inside the room. After multiple calls trips to the front desk and maintenance even requesting assistance for us someone finally came over an hour later.    The security guard let us into the room but we had to show out ID's. My husband grabbed his wallet out of his shorts that were located in his suitcase. When opening the wallet the cash was seen by the guard (around $600). The next day my husband goes to pay for something and all of this cash was gone. He had not used his wallet up until then. It had been in the room the entire time and nothing else from our room was missing just the cash that was seen.    We reported this to Caesars and have had little communication from them or help. Just moving us up the line to people that probably will not call us back. We were comped for two days of resort fees upon checking out which was kind but we are still out several hundred dollars.    I booked with Caesars thinking this would be a safe and secure place to stay only to assumably be stolen from by security which are people put in place to protect guests. I have zero faith in this establishment and will definitely not be returning to a place that apparently does not care about guest security.
30,"Check in was a nightmare! We were there during a major convention/show & they obviously were not prepared. We were ""lucky"" enough to check n earlier in the day and only had to wait about 45 minutes (which is ridiculous) Friends who checked in later in the day--waited for over 2 hours! Outrageous! In addition to that--after you pay for your room on your booking sight you also have to pay a ""resort fee"" of $52 a day! For what? Housekeeping? Didn't have it! Pool? Never used!  AND--be prepared to dole out a ton of money for any food/beverage you want! Crazy Expensive! And it's not even that great of a hotel. The room was clean & quiet the bed was comfortable & the shower was hot! That's all we really needed for this trip. But I will be sure to look for other options next time! And I definitely would not recommend this hotel to anyone"
10,I had no choice  my convention was at Caesar . The charges for the room too expensive . That resort fee really a still  when they know very well that if you are there for business you CANNOT use the services of the resort . They include the wife in the resort fee. Which hotel is charging the Wife nowadays (only in Vegas). And that bar refrigerator  they charge you only if you open the door to look !!! Absurd
40,"The awesome- we waited in a long line at desk for an upgrade. Suddenly 3 additional frint desk staff showed up andthe line moved quickly. We figured we would wait and be turned down but not only was Salvador super kind he was able to get our upgrade. Salvador made our weekend.    Then i had a question about Venus Night Swim. I went to the desk outside the pool. Crystal was helpful and kind with her answers to my questions.    Our upgrade to Palace Tower 23 floor made things so nice. View of both the pool and the hills in the distance. I recommend!    Bunches of places all around inside Caesars and just a short walk to shop eat out gamble.    The less awesome: our forum room 53-- or 58-- I get it confused - in Forum tower was shockingly small and dingy. The couch was not big enough to sleep on.    Lots of construction going on.    Don't play slots here. A casino is not a charity but I keep a cash budget for entertainment purposes only. Their slot machines don't pay. Today is day 3. I go downstairs to smoke and play slots. I discreetly look at the credits on machines as i walk by. I mostly saw ""winners"" usually between $30-$100 only two or three people were in the hundreds. The same was true at Linq and O'Sheas. I usually go home with a little cash left over or even a win. Not this time. Very disappointing. Don't play slots here. I do know one friend won 4k at Linq but my exoerience has been awful."
20,This was my first time traveling to Vegas for business and first time staying at Caesars Palace. If you like gambling excessive smoke being charged $50 for early check-in poor cell phone reception receiving a $40+ bill for a ten minute call and eating overpriced food then this place is for you. Having 4000 rooms but a small staff means waiting in line for more than an hour to check-in and the express check-in machine wouldn‚Äôt recognize my confirmation number nor name. I was in initially impressed by housekeeping staff - they switched out feather pillows before I could barely get to the room. But then they worked so slowly on my floor that I never had my room cleaned for five days but would venture into hallway to ask for linen. I didn‚Äôt touch the mini bar nor put anything near it yet I was charged $13 for Figi water. It took a week and a tweet before billing department finally responded with the credit and a reminder not to touch the minibar. They laughed when I asked them to waive one of the phone calls (totaled less than 10 minutes) because there is no rate card in the room and who knew two quick calls to Washington DC would be so expensive. If I ever return to Vegas I‚Äôll go back to Polo Towers or Tahiti Village for less smoke and better customer service.
30,We‚Äôve been in Octavios Tower before but this was a worst condition ever. Knowing that this tower is newer than a Augusta and even though for it‚Äôs age i think the maintenance is falling off. From the hallway to the room was very disappointed.
40,Huge room with a comfortable bed. Very quiet! The only negative thing is that it wasn‚Äôt possible to use the fridge for free. The view was nice. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We definitely come again when in Las Vegas.
50,I like to stay at different Vegas hotels each trip. New one this trip was 2 seperate 3 night stays both in Octavius tower.    1st 3 nights the room key didnt work. The trek back to reception was annoying (im diamond so not as far as normal reception but still far). Didnt get an apology despite me going back to the same person who gave me the original key.    When I finally got in the room needed a few things fixed but they did send someone up fast. Room was very clean and a good size.    2nd 3 nights went smoothly and everything was good.
10,"1st we waited in line to check in for over 4 hours. We didn't get into our room until after 4am. They gave a $100 room credit but then still charged me for the credit we used. When we got to the room it was 85 degrees. We turned on the AC and it never cooled down at all after 24 hours of the AC being on. Called maintenance and he said there is cold air blowing from the vent but it was not cooling the room at all. He told me there was nothing he could do to fix it and suggested we ask for a new room if it's stays to hot. After suffering for the 1st night we decided it would be best to ask for a new room. When going to the front desk I spoke to the manager to ask we get a different room. He called maintenance and was told that the cold air was blowing. I insisted that it was not cooling the room AT ALL. He basically was refusing to give us a new room. He then sent us back to the room for maintenance to look at it again! Maintenance then confirmed that yes its blowing cold air but not cooling the room as I said. They gave us a smaller room and it smelled like cat pee and mold. It made me severely sick. I knew it would be pointless to complain again.  The fridge....""mini bar"" was locked and we were told there is a $75 charge to get a code to open it and it can not be used for personal use. There is no microwave either.  I will never recommend this hotel to even my worst enemy. It was awful!!!!! DO NOT STAY THERE!!!"
10,Booooooo. I would rate 0 if I could. Mold remote wouldn‚Äôt work lights didn‚Äôt work took an hour to check in took 2 days to get a hold of someone and when they finally came they wiped the mold with a cloth and said it‚Äôs good.
10,"The check in and out experience was terrible. We were ""offered"" early check in if we paid $65. Because we just wanted to get into our room and get out of the long lines we paid the fee. We still did not get into our room until 3:30 pm - only 1/2 hour before regular check in. Check out was equally as terrible. We are unlikely to ever stay at Cesars again."
30,The room was very nice  clean and comfortable that wasn‚Äôt the issue. We had a reservation and when we attempted to check in we waited in line for over an hour. Caesar‚Äôs should be much more efficient in this process . Unacceptable with the technology of the day with an operation that size .
50,Gemma was customer service personified for our entire interaction. She was thorough while still being respectful of my time and genuinely cared about me having a great experience at the hotel. And of course she has quite the dazzling smile to go along with her all that talent. #TotalPackage
40,We stayed for 10 days in an Augustus room with fountain view. We had booked the Octavius tower and were upgraded when we checked in but did not request this. A couple of days before check out I went to review the bill and it was $700 more than expected as they had charged us for the upgrade. It took 2 people a couple of days to rectify it but they did remove the extra charges. I did wonder how many would have just paid and realised later so always check the invoice thoroughly before leaving.  We were lucky and checked in at the diamond reception area which was very quick with no wait but we saw queue at the main desk whenever we went past. Whenever we visited this desk the staff were very friendly and helpful.  The view from the room was awesome the room was nice but some of the furniture and carpet are looking a little tired. The room was cleaned everyday for us which was requested at check in.  As mentioned in other reviews there is a smell of sewage near the Augustus tower entrance and lifts but this wasn‚Äôt in the corridor where our room was on 38 floor.  The only other little niggle was the pool area there is now only 1-2 pools that can be used free of charge and all others require a reservation with extra charge there was no mention of this when we booked. We were able to find a lounger most days but it felt like the hotel were trying to recoup their covid losses by charging for everything.  We had a fantastic time in Vegas but I do feel that the hotel needs to update the rooms as they do not compare with the more luxurious rooms at Venetian & Wynn but charge a similar price.
50,The kids love the lazy pool so wonderful how u guys only casino that allow kids we‚Äôre blessed for you to have us I would recommend this to anyone bout Harrah‚Äôs . casino! I enjoy the staff workers here which are so helpful and kind. I would definitely come again without any questions.
10,The rooms are fine but the customer service is the worst. They had two to four people working the front desk at peak check-in and check-out times. Want to stand in line for two plus hours to do the check-in you actually already did online thinking it would save time? Wish granted! Want to stand in line for another two hours at midnight on your husband‚Äôs 50th birthday when there‚Äôs an issue with a room key? Wish granted. We were so excited to finally stay at Caesar‚Äôs but don‚Äôt expect we will be back and would strongly caution anyone else to look elsewhere. Caesar‚Äôs is cheaping out by minimally staffing and they‚Äôve also made the fridges full of things that result in a $75 charge if you touch them so don‚Äôt go thinking that your room that is listed as having a fridge actually does have a fridge you can use to store that yummy box of leftovers.
10,I was at Ceasars for a work conference. When I arrived there was a power issue and we were moved to a different tower to which I was charged additional $51.02 per day for. The refrigerator you are not permitted to use good luck seeing that sign in such a dark room. If you touch something you'll find you get charged not only for it but also additionally a $75 fee! I tried messaging and calling management but they don't seem interested. Now to explain to my employer why my room now costs $500 more than originally charged! Stay elsewhere!!!
20,I stayed in Caesars Palace from 19/07-22/07/22. Though the hotel is beautiful with great rooms but terrible when it comes to customer service.    I ordered room breakfast service from their Pronto cafe on 20th July and paid via my debit card online. On checking out on 22nd July I paid the remaining balance and asked for receipt to be emailed. Upon checking invoice later to my surprise the hotel charged me for same breakfast again from my Amex CC. Since then I am unsuccessfully chasing for a refund. I live in Australia and was on vacation in July so it is not easy for me to call them often due to time difference and they hardly reply via email. When I raised this with customer service at Caesars their E-Communications specialist (Shiela M) replied initially but could not resolve it. As per her she could not find details though I sent her copies of my debit card transaction details along with Amex CC summary stating that I have been charged twice for the same service. I have now raised this with bank to get a refund.    As mentioned earlier the hotel itself is beautiful but good luck if you ever need any help from their customer service dept. I would highly recommend to check your invoice before checking out.    Given there are so many other beautiful hotels with great shopping complex I would never recommend Caesars Palace to anyone.
10,Do not stay at this hotel the checking in and checking out was horrible. They are extremely inefficient and they are quick to charge you for any overages and fees when possible. No such thing as even a late checkout and once you even touch the snackbar you will get accidentally charged for something you didn't consume. Their staff is trained to incur fees and charges on you as soon as possible and as quickly as they are allowed. I've never came across a hotel which nickel and dimed you so hard. On top of that the service was horrible. Never staying here again.
50,My wife and I visited Las Vegas for the first time in five years. We spent four nights at Caesars Palace. We checked in around 7:30 a.m. so no real lines to speak of. Our room was ready shortly after noon. We originally booked a room in the Augustus Tower where we had stayed before but at check-in we changed to Palace Tower to be closer to the conference we were attending. It was a wise decision because Caesars is a huge property. We stayed in a Palace Premium Studio which was spacious and clean. The second bathroom was a nice bonus. The room was comfortable and clean. Staff was courteous and friendly. We ate at a variety of restaurants at Caesars from Bobby's Burgers to Old Homestead. All were a good experience. We also had a lot of fun in the casino.    The hospitality industry is facing a lot of challenges in the wake of COVID. Caesars Palace is doing as good a job as any in balancing all these challenges. It's a top-notch resort. We look forward to our next stay.
50,Ms Zandra is the best she went to the limit to make sure I got the right rate as a veteran and a reward customer she didn‚Äôt rush me and she was courteous and understanding and explained to me how the system really works
20,For all its reputation checking in and out of Caesar Place was a nightmare. It can take up to an hour. Also don‚Äôt expect daily house keeping service to change your bedding. You have to request it. And those cheap instant coffee packets that most hotels provide for free? Caesar‚Äôs charges $20.00  Give me a break.  Regards  ‚ÄúDisappointed‚Äù
10,It took us 1.5 hours to check inn (waiting in line).  Be careful if you book more than 1 room and want them to be close to each other: there are different towers and everything is far away from each other.  No personal contact with any of the staff members possible..  The hotel is to big to be managed properly. Could not find our way in the hotel.
10,I stayed at this hotel to celebrate my husbands 50th birthday. There were 17 of us staying here.  I have stayed in various hotels on the strip but wanted to stay here as apparently this is an iconic hotel.  The queues for reception were ludicrous- there was no concierge and any matter we had we had to wait I. Reception. The phone in the room didn‚Äôt work so this had to be done.  $75 to use the mini bar the coffee machine in the room eye watering expensive the towels were. Threadbare and cleaning was hit and miss- and this was supposed to be a 5 star hotel.  The staff are stressed- they were shouting at guests who were equally frustrated by the bad service.  The main pool was closed during the week- so the other pools were crammed. The other hotels on the strip I had stayed in were far more accommodating and had good pool facilities.  The resort fee is not reflective of the quality of this hotel. This hotel has had its time and there are too many good hotels on the strip that charge less and provide a better quality service. I rarely give bad reviews but to those going here please reconsider as it‚Äôs an expensive holiday for it to be compromised with this less than satisfactory standard.
50,We had a family vacation planned and after watching The Hangover thought this would be a fun stay!  We booked the Palace Tower. We were totally shocked at the size of the room and that there were two bathrooms! (although joined by a massive Jack and Jill shower two water closets were a huge bonus!  The view of the pool was lovely! The location to pool access was also fantastic!  Our room was spotless every time we came back and the housekeeping staff was very friendly.  We did not eat at the hotel.  We read other reviews and learned there is a Keurig machine in room but pods were a fee so we brought our own.  Self check in was easy as was the pre check in online. Check out was just as simple.  We never actually talked to the lobby staff as we just used the kiosks.  Only complaint was the smell in the ha.way by the elevators. Smelled like a bathroom not super pleasant. Gave us headaches.  Yes resort fee is up there but it‚Äôs well noted on all booking sites so we expected it!  Great location on the strip to explore everything!
30,This has to be our 5th time to stay here while attending a conference. While the price keeps increasing the restaurants have gone up in an unbelievable manner. The best thing here was our room attendant for 5130. She did a great job. Of course dont expect complimentary in room coffee. Go across the street to CVS for coffee much cheaper than $5. The room was about as far away from the conference center as you can get. A brisk 15 minute walk. Not really easy to get back to the room during a break. The thing best is waiting 45 minutes to register at the from desk while 5 employees check you in. This hotel must have almost 5000 rooms and sure don‚Äôt like the ‚Äúresort fee‚Äù. Our conference is here next year but we will not be staying here.
10,The express check was not very express. In fact it was a bit of a disaster. It took about 45 minutes to get checked in. The kiosks would not work for about half of the long line of people checking in. They had two staff members available to help with the process but they we overwhelmed. Apparently the hardware and the software used for the process is outdated and poorly programmed.    We had an Octavius Premium Room with one king bed and non-smoking. The room was large. The bathroom had two sinks. It had a nice partial view of the Bellagio fountains. It had good wifi speed which was free for two devices. However the wifi would drop out a lot. There was no AT&T internet available on our phones when in the room. The room had no refrigerator just an overpriced mini-bar. It had only one luggage rack so if you have two suitcases one of them is on the floor or on the furniture. The room was well lit and clean. However there were hairs in the large bath tub when we arrived. The housekeeping staff was very accommodating if asked for supplies.    The entire resort is designed to extract as much money from its customers as possible. For instance a bottle of water costs $6 throughout the property as well as the adjacent Caesars owned properties. Food at all the Caesars restaurants is extremely overpriced.    Caesars charges a resort fee. This allows for the use of their pools which are only open part of the day. There is very little shade poolside to protect patrons from the desert sun. If you like coffee in the morning expect long lines for coffee unless you get up extremely early. Expect to pay a lot more for your coffee than you do anywhere else    Virtually all the blackjack tables in the casino pay 6 for 5 on blackjacks. This gives the house about four times the advantage over standard blackjack that pays 3 for 2 on blackjacks. The video poker payouts were on the tight side.    I would not stay at Caesars again and recommend choosing another hotel when visiting Las Vegas.
20,I tend to agree with many of the reviews here. The casino itself is nice but the rooms are clearly outdated and in the case of my room in need of repairs. It just seems overall Caesar‚Äôs has this sense of arrogance with how they can get away with charging high prices for such a mediocre hotel and stay.    The hotel makes minimal efforts to meet their check in times of 4 pm. This was unfortunate given we had an early flight and wanted to clean up after walking the strip for several hours. My room barely met the 4 pm time but my friends weren‚Äôt so fortunate and had to wait significantly longer. No explanation or apologies given. Also upon checking in they failed to notify me at the front desk that my entire tower's (the forum) elevators were down so I had to use the service elevators for the first trips back and forth. Totally understand flooding caused that but again zero communication was given. I called the concierge to have my bags delivered as well and after being on hold for 25 minutes I just gave up.    The fitness center is decent provided you can find it (it‚Äôs not marked on any of their signs and I had to ask 5 different staff where it was and only then did we finally find it). No major issues there otherwise.    The pool is lackluster and the staff do a poor job of making sure guests stay hydrated as evidenced by the fact that the water station was dry over half the time I went. Sorry Caesar‚Äôs the vast majority of us don‚Äôt want to pay $15 for an overpriced drink as an alternative.    Also fairly annoying was they ran out of shower gel. What‚Äôs the alternative? Of course; buying from their overpriced ‚Äúconvenience stores‚Äù inside the property. For decently affordable food options forget about it as their food court is a cruel joke. $15 for a crappy burger (nothing else) and this from a place that had easily the best reviews of the bunch.    I gave 2 stars because the cleaning staff were very kind and all of my angst is dedicated to the management. I just get the impression they don‚Äôt care at all. Sadly when the entire strip is basically an oligopoly they rightfully so have little reason to care nor any incentive to improve. I know I won‚Äôt be back.
40,Very pricey. Coffee in room is payable. Music at the swimming pool is too loud like in a disco. Pool is only open to families from 9am-5pm. Hotel is right in the center. Great big rooms with bath. Great facilities. Staff aren't overly friendly as it is a huge hotel with 4000 room you are more like a number. Found out on the last day someone had put a 500 dollar bill on our room. No quibble- hotel believed us and removed the charge.
50,Stayed in room 906. Terrific room. Housekeeping services not the greatest but they would bring things if we called and asked. So many restaurants shops slots etc. available that you wouldn't even have to leave the premises to have things to do. Close in proximity to so many shows and Uber services were great. Very clean except for a sewage odor down one hallway.
20,Stayed at this property twice in six weeks to have the same issues come up both times.    At check in I found out they were over sold and asked me to go to a different room than I had booked for one night. On my second night I would of then needed to move to another room. I was only there for two nights so why the heck would I move rooms because of poor management issues.    Also when I got to my room it was dirty and not cleaned (seems to be a common theme at this hotel). Repoeted this to management and was promised to have my room cleaned asap but no one ever came. I ended up sleeping on the couch as the bed was dirty. Pool area is beautiful but the largest pool which was mostly empty could only be used if you rented a day bed or cabana. The only pools that the general public could use was the Apollo Pool which was freezing cold and a small pool in the back of the property. Like if people are paying high prices to stay at your hotel with resort fees why don't you open the pools up to everyone so people can have fun?    I just feel that the customer service has gone downhill at Caesars. The housekeeping is non existent pool experience is the worst on the strip and for the price there are other properties that are superior. Just find Caesars has missed the mark and the opportunity to gain new customers and keep existing ones happy.    There is a lot that needs to be done here to fix these problems and I hope this hotel takes the time to address the major issues.
20,Room was fine but prices and service not so. We were told that guests would only $18 Vallet Parking. WRONG. The attendents told us it was $50. Our grand kids had some items from the mini-bar (6 small snacks) and the bill charged us for 12 items. If you dispute any charges there is an $80 dispute charge. I was told there are sensors for all the drinks and snacks and if removed and not placed back quickly you get charged. Did not see any prices anywhere or information. We were told there would be a deduction at the service desk but did not want to wait over an hour to get there. A call for reimbursement never got a return call.
10,Property was in okay condition. Check in and check out process was the worst I ever seen. You check in. Then wait for your room past the 4 pm time they say it should be ready. Then when you go get your key their system is messed up and takes forever. Same thing with check out. Got an email saying you can checkout. Hit that link and error page comes up. Pretty rediculous seeing it's 2022. Room we had was alright a little outdated for something that was considered renovated. Wouldn't stay at this property again since you do pay the premium price without the premium property.
30,The room was nice. Never received a single day of room service. My question is why was I charged $40.82 each day for room fees ? What exactly is this ? My trash cans were overflowing and needed towels. Also on the second day I noticed a dried blood stain on the bed sheets. Sent a message to Ivy and towels and bed sheets were delivered but the room was never serviced.
50,Clean nice room  great location big line in check up but the front desk girl forgot her name but I believe she is from Honduras was amazing in every way  helpful  give us all the detail and took her time to explain  she was my first impression and she did amazing
30,Terrible customer service at time of check-in. Absolutely all the people complaining on the line due to the long process to check in ( literally took us over 50 minutes ) for some reason the check in machines doesn‚Äôt allow to some guest to complete the check in. The Lobby Ambassador was so rude. Many of us tried to talk to the manager but they told us that there was no one in charge. They undoubtedly knew very well about the service they were providing. Once complete the check in process we headed to the room and the elevators in the tower that we had been assigned to our room were not working. Unfortunately Cesar Palace is no longer the hotel it was before the pandemic. The employee who guided us to our room confessed that the management of the hotel was not the best.
30,It started with my room was ready at 130 PM when I checked in. But was told if I wanted the room key at that time I would have to pay $25 or I could come back at 4 PM for key. They also have a Resort Fee of $52 a day for internet that I couldn‚Äôt get on and something else it covers which is bull
10,I'm waiting for my money stolen in this hotel I'm contacting some Brazilian communities in las vegas and I'll put the experience I had at Ceasers palace during 15 days of accommodation no one took action on the theft they deducted only 1 night and that the room was cleaned a few times during the stay no shampoo towels and amenites were left in the room a real horror I spent in this hotel. from a closed compartment in my personal bag. When I missed the money the day before the money was still in the bag and they still claim that the investigation is long. high level hotel where guests could rest assured but on the contrary we lost 4 nights after being robbed just chasing our right we went after the managers 15 times 9 times in security the incident form was filled out but the hotel returned the stolen money. Here is our indignation and I know that many Brazilians like to stay at Ceasers Palace so I leave my opinion that nothing has been resolved I will put this evaluation on TripAdvisor and on other social evaluation networks so that mainly Brazilians know what the conduct of this hotel is. unfortunate.
50,We had an amazing time staff is very friendly I would like to mention Seth at the pool and Maria at the pool as well they are amazing friendly the go above and beyond excellent customer service.    Michelle Gargiulo from NY
50,Love this place! Everything about this location is great! I enjoyed the pool and restaurants at Caesars Palace. The staff is courteous and the hotel is very clean. This location is the only hotel I stay when visiting Las Vegas.
50,Caesars Palace in the middle of it all! GREAT location! GREAT variety of restaurants and shops all on property! Beautiful relaxing pool! Spa has lots of options and friendly staff! Assortment of gaming to choose from! Safe. Clean. Beautiful and Comfortable rooms! Staff always friendly and willing to help! Will always stay at Caesars!!!
20,It was a vacation package booked through American Airlines the price was right!  We made the best of our stay! Unfortunately for an upscale hotel or so I thought it was quite disappointing. First checking in I waited in line for over two hours. The hotel is tremendous and there is some beauty to be seen. However the smell in the lobby hallway going to the Octavius Tower where our room was located was disgusting. Everyday it smelled like sewage backup GROSS!  Housekeeping what's that?There for 4 nights and not once did housekeeping clean/make-up the room. Even having pressed the button everyday on our way out - white light means make up room. They overlooked it so I had to call daily for clean towels and for garage to be picked up. Not good customer service and outrageous resort fees. So needless to say I would not recommend staying here. Other hotels in the Vegas area are not as expensive and better customer service. Do Not let the name fool you...it's no palace. Over-rated over-priced and under-delivered.
30,"We have been checked in for less than 3 hours and have a 4 day stay ahead of us. First our room was dirty. It had old food trash and dirty napkins in the drawers. When I called the front desk to ask for trash bags to clean it they came up to clean it and just said sorry and that was it.. would‚Äôve expected a little more as we are staying in a premium suite but it‚Äôs alright.    The tub had hair in it and the shower had a questionable substance in it that I cleaned up. Heads up - they charge you $75 to simply use the mini fridge for personal use (not even drink the drinks inside of it JUST to use the mini fridge!).    We ordered room service that was $91 for 2 people (2 burgers 2 sides 2 drinks). Half of our order did not show up... Called the front desk and they just said sorry and that a manager will contact us in 24-48 hours. They ended up giving us partial credit the next morning so that was appreciated.    We came here to celebrate our five year anniversary and my birthday and so far it has been an okay experience. I know the staff and management do not care too much because we're just another ""unhappy"" customer but we have been so appreciative during all of this despite that.    3 stars because the room bathroom and view are nice although the wood furniture is very chipped.    I will update this review if things do get better during our stay here but so far 3 stars!"
30,My husband and I had stayed at Caesar‚Äôs in April and it was wonderful. HOWEVER‚Ä¶. This trip was not so good. Not so sure I will go there again. Before we even get into the building we get stuck in the elevator in the parking garage. 10-12 of us stuck in a hot dark elevator. We used the emergency phone but the guy who answered was totally unconcerned!! We are hot and trying our best not to panic and this guys says we will be there when we can. HELLOOOO???? It‚Äôs 100+degrees and we are stuck in an elevator and he is unconcerned. Then someone calls Caesar‚Äôs and the lady answered and said she is not on the premises. We asked her to please call someone and she acted like that was an inconvenience. Eventually the guys on the elevator got both sets of doors opened and helped us crawl out of the elevator that was halfway between floors. The lady at check in was unconcerned. Didn‚Äôt even seem to register our concerns. Then we had to haul our luggage down sets of stairs to get into the building. It was horrible. It took till sometime the next day to get those elevators working. It was very frustrating.  There were 2 moms and 2 daughters in our party. Yet they only gave us 3 towels. We had to call housekeeping 3 days out of our trip to get them to bring us enough towels so we could even have 1 each.  Hotel eateries close at 7pm.  It was a very disappointing stay Especially after things were so nice in my previous stay. That is why we booked here for this trip. Doubtful I will stay there again
20,My stay at Ceasar palace was disappointing.  My room wasn‚Äôt available till an hours after check in. I tried to drop my bell hop but no one was working at the stand. When I got my room it was Terrible. All the furniture was damaged wood was cracked and chipped missing huge chunks. The tub was plastic and the front panel was push in to expose wood. They switch rooms for me and the bathtub jets didn‚Äôt work. They was a power outage the first night so the food court was closed! And the halls smelled of waste! Would not stay again.
40,We had the pleasure of staying in room 4166 the room had a fountain view that was excellent. The room was extremely clean and the house keeping staff was phenomenal. The room was a upgrade with a jetted tub that was thoroughly used. If you upgrade your room at check in you get early check in waived. I hated that they charge for Early check-in. Also the room was very stuffy had to call maintenance to service the air conditioner but responded quickly. Would stay again.
10,I will buck the trend of the great feedback given to Caesar‚Äôs Palace. However I feel a few fundamental things are wrong with the hotel which has left me feeling frustrated and bemused.    I do not like to write negative pieces as I always feel it says more about the reviewer than the place or product. In this instance I had to write out my honest feelings about my three days stay which cost over $1500    - Standard of the hotel: Caesar‚Äôs Palace looked like it needed a refurbishment ten years ago never mind today. There was a musty cigarette smell throughout the hotel including the room I stayed with my wife and 7-year-old son. Not pleasant. The furnishings in the room were dated and chipped and the water pipes creaked very loudly due to a broken water system. The internet connection was constantly down meaning that my work conference calls kept failing.  - Uninterested staff: Customer service was non-existent and the staff looked as dejected as I did. Management was defensive and lacked interest in the issues we were having.  - No Concierge: Each time we needed to queue we had to wait at least 15 minutes even for a basic request. One reception desk was not resourced at all even during the busiest of times.  - Pay for everything at the highest price: The room despite being quite high priced came with nothing. No water and the fridge if used would be chargeable. The water in the room would have cost $14 for a tiny bottle of water. Good job I asked before I consumed anything. $70 for two coffees two croissants and a granola pit from Starbucks. Is this reasonable?    Overall I felt the hotel was living on yesteryears reputation and needs to buck its ideas up. Plenty of other modern hotels seem to recruit and look after staff that make them happy and in turn care for the customers.
30,To be honest a deceiving experience with staff not really concerned and a raging room with cleaningness issues - calc seems not to be seen by the cleaning staff and additionally one bottle of water at $11 and 4 coffee capsules at $22 (unacceptable)
20,Was disappointed with the service in the front desk. Elevator broke and they had us going up stairs try to speak with front desk to have them move us to a different tower and called 5 time they would put me on hold and never help me or offered any compensation
50,Absolutely amazing place.  The staff were very attentive and got free upgrade when checking in to a suite!  The room and whole hotel were spotlessly clean  Drinks were very expensive - almost $60 for 2 cocktails by the pool. Bottled water $6 in shop in hotel  Excellent location
10,The biggest complaint was the smell of sewer gas in various parts of the hotel throughout a week long stay. Sometimes it was in the hallway outside our room sometimes in common hallways. But it was always present somewhere. There is a sewer gas problem somewhere in this hotel. The hotel doesn‚Äôt even acknowledge it exists even though every guest is complaining about it when they encounter.  Heavy rains on the night of July 28 had water leaking thru the light fixtures in the lobby. What major resort hotel leaks when it rains?  The lights in the hallway of our room floor were out for several hours one day. There did not appear to be any or inadequate emergency exit lighting as I had to use my phone flashlight to get to the elevator. This would have been a disaster had there been an emergency situation.  We arrived a couple of hours before the standard check in time. I fully expected our room might not be ready and available. There are lots of late check outs in Las Vegas. I get it. To my surprise our upgraded room was ready and available. However if I wanted to access it before the standard check in time I had to pay $65. I get a fee if you wanted to guarantee an early check in but when your room is ready and you are there they are going to stick it to for $65 just because they can? We were attending a conference that was at the hotel. Would never choose this property for my own personal travel or arrange a conference there. So many other better run properties on the strip.
10,Check in process was extremely long and difficult. Checking out was impossible! They gave people a bottle of water. Never apologize for the inconvenience. I was lucky to get a room which was completely different from my prepaid reservation. I was told at check in that I would be refund all resort fees during my stay. I've made it back home and still trying to receive this credit. No A/C in room floors was extremely hot! The last person I'm assuming who stayed in my room clothes was still hanging up in the closet. I was put in a double bed room one bed was broken. The remote did not have a back on it the neighbors remote can change your TV if both are watching TV at the same time. The outlet next to the bed did not work. And still I'm on the phone asking for what I was told upon checkin! Never again!! If it was for the conference I would of never been there and trust and believe I'm NEVER going back!
10,Booked three nights for my birthday. Got 2 massages at the spa $500. Excited for my weekend. Got in line 12:45am to check in to my room. It's now 2:15am and I still got 40 people in front of me. Rarely do I say never. Should have stayed at Cosmo...
20,The room was fine bathroom with plenty of lightening and spacious. I was disappointed by the sewer smell when getting out of the Uber and the poor location of dropping off that has me dragging my luggage they the casino for what felt like a long time. The self checkins were not functioning half of the nice fountains out front weren‚Äôt working either. After getting my room key and making the walk down the corridor to elevator the sewer smell was pungent disgusting! The pool surroundings are beautiful but the chairs are worn and torn unless you pay the $150 to reserve. I‚Äôve traveled a ton but first time in Vegas and I expected the glam sparkle and touch of class but I didn‚Äôt find it. My advice lower your expectations and ignore anything you‚Äôve ever seen in tv including ads
10,The worst possible experience  Left a day early  Power outages  Extreme banging outside windows of Unknow origin- on the 15th floor  Water pressure low  Food Court closed Sunday thru Thursday  Sewage smell in the elevator‚Äôs  Incorrect charges for mini bar  Lake of efficiency in check in and check out process - ever again.  Going back to Harrahs or the Mirage or a dozen other resorts.
20,The hotel is good the pool fantastic.    Where we were EVENTUALLY put in the Augustus Towers there was a terrible stench of rotten eggs at ground level.    Our overall experience was very much spoiled by the front desk and we feel very CHEATED.    For our last night in the US we had booked a nice large room with two bathrooms which was not available upon check in.    Rather than being offered something equivalent (or better) the only thing that the manager Rosalina offered us was a smaller room with a nice view but not as large and apparently at a discount (which we have yet to see any evidence of).    Is it not too difficult to just give guests the room that they book?    We leave Caesar's Palace with a very bad taste in our mouths (and a bit of a bad smell in our nostrils).    AVOID
40,We spent 5 days in CP In May-June and enjoyed the Palace Tower premium rooms. Close to the pool complex. Large room with spa tub dual sinks and separate bathroom.  It is our home away from home.  The downside of this trip was the shortage of CWs and for some reason paper cups while gambling.
10,The customer service was horrible. I was there for a convention and they only had 3 people working the check in desk - they would help one person and then go on break so there ended up being only 1 person for the entire line. They over charged my credit card. My receipt they gave me was for $646 they charged my credit card $989. The hallway to our tower smelled of sewage. The headboard in my room was torn in multiple places and the closet was cut in half so I could not hang my dresses up. I could have understood that if I was in a handicap room but the bed was so high I had to jump onto it. The power went off and the elevators did not work and the restaurants could not cook food. The staff was incredibly rude. I was very disappointed considering Caesars Palace is supposed to be one of the better hotels.
20,"We were at Ceasars for a 3 day weekend. I have to say we got VERY lucky that when we arrived at 7am (prepared for a long day of ""wait for early check in siege"") there was ONE room available in the Octavius tower. So we almost threw the $65 early fee at the check in lady and said ""WE'LL TAKE IT!"". The rest of our traveling party was not so lucky. They arrived at the same time tried to check in with clerk next to us who didn't even bother to look at availability just told them ""Come back at 8am and we'll register you to receive a qr code when a room is available"". Seriously lacking customer service. I don't know what time they were every able to actually check in but it was after 12pm and multiple rounds of checking with front desk and dealing with the ""kiosks that never work"". Our room was meh. Headboard was peeling and scratched. Bottom of bathroom doors looked like some animal had chewed it. AC was NOT functioning properly. Room was warm never cooled down properly and reeked of weed. Velvet sofa had some seriously stiff stains on it (EWW). The worst part was the stench in the hallways. Smelled STRONGLY of sewage. We were told by a waiter at one of the restaurants at Cesars that it was some ""sump pump"" issue. Whatever it was it was disgusting and took away ANY illusions you weren't overpaying for a dilapidated hotel. The lobby at check in time looked like a refugee camp with exhausted irritable travelers and all their luggage (and kids and dogs) allllll over the floors and into hallways. There is no room service. There is no free coffee. They will literally nickel and dime you to death. We paid over $300 for one of our nights there and it was a waste of money. Casino was busy but smelled terrible. All in all if I had paid $69 a night I prolly wouldn't complain. Sadly this place is a shell of its former self. The spa was the only bright spot as service and atmosphere were very good (but VERY expensive). But you can always get a day pass to visit that. Avoid this hotel stay somewhere that still has class structural integrity and customer service."
50,Cesar‚Äôs palace was great. We enjoyed our stay. The staff was very helpful and polite. The location was perfect and central to everything. The hotel had a ton of high end shops attached to it. There were plenty of restaurants as well but they book up early so make reservations a week or two in advance.
10,"Look I like the Caesars brand have stayed here many times in the past but this one was amazingly bad. Checked in Friday 7/22/22 no issues except long lines and wait times to use Kiosks typical so I understand. Saturday no issues was able to go to the pool have some beverages all was going great until Sunday 7/24/22. Went to the pool for a couple hours then when we get ready to go back up to our room the elevators were not working this was around 230pm. We asked multiple times what the issue was the security guard couldn't give us a tin of info just the ""they are working on it and it should start working soon"". So I ask can we use the stairs and his reply was ""No there aren't any stairs available""... This made me wonder what if there was a fire and we were upstairs how would we get down? ""Well you can go down the stairwells you just cant go now because its dark and we don't have enough staff to escort anyone up and down them"".    I feel for the security guard he was clearly thrown into an issue by himself to just tell people that they will be working shortly. Then some higher ups in suits show up to hand out tiny bottles of water for our troubles. Never an explanation never an offer to help with our stay for having to sit in our wet clothes for three hours. I'm sure we could have went back out to the pool while we waited but we needed to start getting ready for our reservation.    By Monday morning the elevators still weren't working. We had a flight to catch and we had to lug suitcases and golf clubs down 6 flights of stairs because they still weren't working! I called multiple times to try to get someone to offer us some type of compensation and was either hung up on or told I would need to file a complaint with management... which is what I was trying to do!    Maybe someone from management will see this review on the website who knows I just feel bad for the older couples I saw struggling to make it up more stairs than I had too."
10,Have stayed once before and thought it was worth another stay as I usually stay at MGM properties but I was wrong. If I could give it zero stars I would. First let‚Äôs start with the guy in line causing problems. Took 45 min for them to notice and finally call security.    Went to check in after paying and they said had an outage in our tower. Okay no problem. They said I would be refunded and I could have a free stay at Harahs. I said im absolutely not staying at Harahs. I came from Canada and I wanted something nicer they said Harahs or nothing. And I could ‚Äúwalk‚Äù over for the pool. (Spouse has a broken leg) I booked through my airline and the airline had a 5 hour wait. Harahs is 36.00 a night not 150.00 I said okay what can I pay to stay elsewhere Caesar‚Äôs. They said they were fully booked in every hotel which was a lie as I was on the app. I wouldn‚Äôt receive my refund for 5-7 days which is unacceptable but then after calling again tonight was told no refund as I booked through an airline. They left me stranded with a guest with a broken leg to find another hotel and find a way to get there with all the luggage. Meanwhile people were getting there rooms and being helped. I believe if I had looked better when checking in I would have been accommodated.    Spent 2 hours in the lobby with all the luggage and a spouse with a broken leg trying to book something else as Harahs has drug addicts all around and nasty rooms. Paid for 2 cabs one from airport and one from there.    What a joke. Lost billions during the pandemic apparently and treat guest like this.    I called MGM who was more than happy to help me. Don‚Äôt bother with Caesar‚Äôs place. I now paid double the price for a 3 day trip that I should have just booked with MGM to begin with.
10,I‚Äôve been and stayed in Vegas COUNTLESS of times and needless to say‚Ä¶ I was very excited to stay at Caesars. Well definitely not worth all the hype or the price.  Let start with Check in we show up early around 7am so check in line was empty. This was the ONLY time we saw the line this short during our stay. We are then told we need to pay 75 dollars for upgrade A NIGHT to avoid early check in fee. We decline that offer and she says we‚Äôd get a text once our room is ready. She asked for credit card to put on file (obviously) but then notice a charge for $300. (??) trying to figure out if it‚Äôs the resort fees but seems a little ridiculous.    It is now 1pm and I head to get a status on our room. I speak to a very nice lady at the self check in kiosks area and she tells me that early check in was never applied and it was only a $25 fee. I was never told that in the beginning or I would of just paid it up front!  She gets us all checked in and we head to our room after waiting 6 hours.    We head to our room and very basic. Just with a large nice shower! One of our sheets had a hole in the middle of the bed.  We pick up the phone to call for our luggage and the phone doesn‚Äôt work!!!! The hand held phone wasn‚Äôt turning on so I had to talk on speaker. But the directory buttons were not working either. I was able to press 0 to get transferred to the hotel operator which transferred me to bell hop. Finally spoke to someone after waiting 15 minutes on hold.    We were only staying a couple nights so we chose to not get our room cleaned. But then realized we needed more toilet paper. There was no extra roll provided. We walked down our hallway and saw no housekeeping. And guess what we couldn‚Äôt call since our phone didn‚Äôt work!  So guess what we had to do.  Wait in the check in line to get toilet paper. But since we‚Äôre there we asked for a itemized receipt since I was still wondering about the $300 charge. After waiting 20 minutes in line we‚Äôre told we couldn‚Äôt not get a receipt until check out. But at least we did get toilet paper to the room.    We were really looking forward to trying the buffet but was told it was 2 months out for reservations. You would think they would keep spots opened for guest staying at their hotel. We tried to get in que for walk in but never received a text. Oh well guess I‚Äôll never try it now!    Now let‚Äôs head to check out. We did pay $75 for late check out which she made sure to apply that fee.  But at 2pm there is only a CHECK IN line. The express checkout which they promote on their website are kiosks. But the duration of our stay we never saw those kiosks actually working except that afternoon we got there. The only thing working on those things was the repair man!!  After waiting 45 minutes to check out I finally get my answer to the $300 charge. It was just a hold but would of been nice to know the breakdown of the hold and the resort fee.    Throughout our stay it was almost impossible to find any staff to ask simple questions.  I understand COVID took a hit on things and staffing is short but maybe you shouldn‚Äôt be making as many reservations if you can‚Äôt accommodate your guests needs.    Stay at the Flamingo. Half the price and updated rooms.
10,Quoted one rate at check in and then charged double at check out! Was told tough luck. One of the kids threw up all over the bed and when I called housekeeping at 1 am they said I had a long wait for clean bedding. Had to beg them to send some up asap. I will never go to another Caesar's casino ever.
20,"So my wife and I had the privilege of staying at your hotel this past weekend. So much to discuss in one tweet but here goes.  Where do I start? How about check-in. We tried to check in at around 1pm on Thursday (early yes).  After waiting in line for about 20mins we were told our room was ready. Great! Not so fast. While the room was ready check in is officially at 4pm. You will have to pay $50 to check in early or upgrade for $50 extra a night. To a friggen' room that is already clean and ready for use.  Here is a pool key so you can use the pool while we ""get the room ready"". We got our text message at 3:56pm that our room was ready!!! So we check in and go up to our room. We were staying in the forum tower which is the oldest tower so room very dated but OK.  We noticed a cheap Keurig machine in room but could not see any k-pods. We did find a gourmet coffee box with 4 k-pods creamer and sugar. On further investigation discovered that it was $14 to purchase. No free coffee. Are you kidding me? I have never been to a hotel/motel that didn't have even basic coffee.    There are about 6 pools and the whole garden of the gods is wonderful. However only 2 pools are freely accessible. The other 4 are available if you pay even for a chair! And at 7pm on weekends the pool area becomes an adult area where you have to purchase a chair canopy or cabana to use the pool.  Shall I mention the resort fee ($52 per day) which is not included in the room rate? I asked what we got for paying this resort fee. You get wifi and access to the gym and pool. Hang on a second that is what you get at ALL other hotels (outside Vegas of course) for FREE! It is a basic service!!!    It was over 100 degrees this weekend and you provide no shade. Why can't you provide some umbrellas? Not everybody wants to bake in the sun especially in this heat. The only shade you provide is if you purchase a canopy for $100.  Things have certainly changed (for the worse) since I first visited Vegas 20 years ago.    You get far less for ridiculous prices. Anyway I will not be frequenting your establishment again but I am sure you will find some other suckers to pay a lot of money for minimal services. Rant over."
40,We ran into a few small issues during our visit. Upon checkout Mrs. Tangela was very helpful. She was pleasant and had exceptional customer service. If we return to Caesars Palace it will be because of her. Thank you!!
30,Pretty overhyped in my opinion. Super old product and really poor / little to non existent service. Impossible to find a buffet reservation Only saving grace was location and decent washroom and room size. Would opt for a newer made resort next time
30,Casino pretty crowded lots of people most of the time often smoky and loud. Decor was okay in parts dated. Pools were nice and the Spa but restaurants and shops were just okay. Rooms okay but not spectacular.
10,Not impressed by Ceasar's. Old outdated room and had a very unpleasant smell all over. It doesn't compare to other top.properties on the strip. I found the dining options too expensive unlike other resorts.
10,The hotel was not up to the expectations in terms of cleanliness service and customer support.  My wife was ill and could not move so I asked for a 1 night extension due to emergency which they declined.  The elevators access to our room had a sewer smell and the room had bird feathers on the floor!  I would not stay there again personally.
20,"My family and I stayed there recently for four nights. Upon arrival (a Monday evening) we waited for an hour and a half to check in. There were three staff members assisting an entire lobby of guests which they tried their hardest and were most apologetic for the wait. At first I was overwhelmed at the room we received in the Augustus Tower as we had a beautiful floor to ceiling window of the Bellagio fountain and the strip. Caesar's did not disappoint is what I told myself. The first night was fabulous as we went to the Forum and had a wonderful dinner. Second day. Trip to Starbucks in the AM was met with an overwhelming smell of sulfur as soon as I stepped off the elevator. The line for Starbucks was long but it's Starbucks. I noticed a young woman in front of me that kept checking her watch. I made the comment to her ""I've never seen a Starbucks that moves at such a snail's pace!"" She made reference that she was going to be late for her shift at the pool and if employees are late they get docked points for every minute and will eventually end up in their termination. She said this was her only chance to get something to eat before she had to work. Keep in mind it was going to be 114 degrees outside that day. I waited in line for 35 minutes to get coffee and she was approximately 27 minutes late for work. There were two lines one for diamond club members and one for us schmucks that aren't priority. The ladies at the counter were nice but definitely not metro Starbucks worthy. Back through the sulphur cloud to the elevator and up to my room. The stench was pretty horrific but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. It's hot outside maybe they have sewage issues that they are fixing.... who knows.  Fast forward. That evening returning to my room housekeeping had not touched our room. There were carts all over the floor when we left at 10:00am. We returned at 4:00pm and nothing. We resorted in using our towels a second day which we had hung up regardless as I try to conserve water wherever we can. Not a big deal. We went to the buffet at 5pm to see if we could be fit in. Astoundingly I was told that the buffet was booked out 2 months in advance and we could be put on a waitlist. Wow! A buffet? Ok put myself on the waitlist and after 45 minutes we went to Planet Hollywood's Gordon Ramsey Burger and were seated immediately. I received a text about half way through our dinner that we would be accepted and I declined. We will try it another day. Headed back to the hotel through the sulphur hallway and back to our room. Still no housekeeping and all carts were vanished from sight. There were lots of bags of trash piled up near the elevator indicating that lots of rooms did not have a visit from housekeeping that day.  Next morning same line at Starbucks same smell from the ground floor. I expected more and thought that housekeeping would come today and maybe I screwed something up that day. We went about our business at 9am returning at 4pm.... still no housekeeping. Really? I called and was met with an automated system (not a person) that wanted to text me answers to my questions. You can literally talk to NO ONE in housekeeping. I asked for towels. Someone brought a bag of towels at 9:30pm.  Third day 9:00am. Sulfur smell was now seeping its way up through the elevator shaft. I skipped Starbucks and we walked to Planet Hollywood where we had Jamba Juice and wonderful coffee. We walked the mall and spent the day at various locations. I actually made a bet with my children whether or not we would have our room cleaned when we got back. Fast forward to 4:00pm opened the door to our room and nothing. I went into full Karen mode at that point. I went down to the front desk bitched to everyone in line that was waiting to check in actually telling one guy ""are you sure that you want to stay here?"". The very sweet Elena at the front desk sympathized with my complaints and gave me a $100 food credit to the hotel and said she would put in a request for more towels and soap to our room which was fulfilled immediately. Thank you Elena you deserve a promotion.  Fourth day: Wake up sulphur smell is now in the hallway. Left for the day. We gave up on housekeeping at this point. We were leaving tomorrow early anyways what did it matter. Had a great day about saw Bodies Exhibit at Bally's went to the Adventure Dome etc. Returned... low and behold our room had been made up! Of course the gratuity envelope was propped up against the lamp which I thought ""yea right"". We went to the pool for a second time which was nice. We thought we'd try our hand at the buffet one more time as we had a strategy this time. We'd waitlist ourselves at 4:00pm and wait until 6:00pm to eat. Well we did that and it backfired on us as I was texted 15 minutes later that our table was ready! We ran down at lightning speed and made it into line. My kids were so excited as they love buffets. When we got to the counter to pay ""It will be $260"". Holy crap?! Really? One adult and two kids? I can't remember the last time I had a meal that was $80 a piece. The website says it was $46 per person which I thought was a stretch. Swallowing hard I paid it. I told the kids ""bypass the salads bread and pasta"". It would have been nice to enjoy all the buffet had to offer but I was floored at the price. We literally ate at Sushi Roku the night before and our whole dinner came to $86. The buffet had a lot to offer and had plenty of seafood and standing rib roasts. Unfortunately the food was literally a buffet. It was cold and what was hot was cold within minutes of you sitting down as the AC was on at 65 degrees. We wasted more food trying to cram in our $80 per person meal within the 90 minutes they allot you. It was similar to watching the 4th of July Nathan's hotdog eating contest rather than enjoying a very nice and EXPENSIVE meal. Bottom line: Don't eat here. It's not worth it I don't care if Christ himself tells you it's the best meal you will ever have. Just NO.  Checking out at 4:45am was interesting as my children witnessed a girl fight at the bar next to the checkout line. Metro was called and by the time I had verified that my $100 voucher was indeed applied the lobby was swarming with security. Lovely. I was happy to leave the sulphur there and from the other reviews that I have read it wasn't just me. Funny as every time we have gone to Las Vegas we stay at PH but spend most of our time at the Forum. My thought this time was that we would never leave. I will never stay here again but will return to PH and others. Ii love the Forum but Caesar's has GOT to do something to improve their tarnished image. I used to love this hotel and now I categorize it with Circus Circus. Please fix it.    Wait! I forgot to mention that the first and only time that housekeeping made our beds they actually made the bed WITH the remote inside the comforter. I don't know how that was possible but when we went to turn the TV on the remote was history! I had to text the operator that our remote was gone and a very friendly and extremely helpful maintenance man was there within a half an hour and gave us a new remote. He also deserves a promotion. But seriously.... you make the bed with the remote buried in the blankets? My thoughts immediately went to the empty gratuity envelope that awaited the ghost housekeeping staff. What a pain in the ass! Thanks housekeeping."
50,Gemma at the check in really took care of our needs and had great customer service. Gemma went above and beyond in her customer service. We made a small request & Gemma made accommodations for us all with a smile.
10,I have stayed at a lot of places on the strip and this was by far the worst experience. This was the octavious rooms supposedly one of the better rooms they have and it was very run down! We stayed 5 days and there is a sewage smell in all the hallways and sinks back up at night. I usually don‚Äôt care about the room that much because you are not in it much but when I went to front desk to tell them about it they didn‚Äôt even want to talk about it. I wasn‚Äôt asking for a refund our anything like that but they should have at least waived our resort fee. They ended up waiving 2 days but it was not the vegas experience we are used to. Will not come back!
30,Checked in online and you have to follow next instructions which tells you to go to a kiosk. You go find the kiosk and basically you have to do it over again and of course there is a line. After you enter your info on kiosk you‚Äôre instructed to see another staff to ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù your check in and there‚Äôs another line for that. It‚Äôs your turn and she gives you your room key. You go find the elevator You go several floors up - and of course the key does not work. You go back down again to get a key that works. It‚Äôs frustrating after a long flight and a 113¬∞ Vegas weather.    You now try find the conference room to register for business meeting and staff does not know where it is. You told them you‚Äôre looking for Caesar‚Äôs Forum Conference and they send you to Caesar‚Äôs Forum shops. You asked Ivy their digital concierge and she tells you it is down on second level. Nope. It is across the strip between Linq and harrahs casinos.    You have to call Housekeeping to get the suite  Cleaned. When you asked for the manager they say they cannot be reached.    What happened to-pre-pandemic Caesar‚Äôs Palace? A bit disorganized.
10,They will Nickel and dime you for everything. They didn't have the room we originally booked available so we had to downgrade for the same cost or upgrade for more money. We chose to upgrade. They also charge a $55 per night resort fee which was supposed to be $45 based on the fineprint when we originally booked. When we got to the room we found more Nickel and diming. The room charged $75 to use the fridge for personal use. Everything in the fridge is on a sensor so if you take it out to look at it then you bought it. And it wasn't cheap. A 4-oz box of cheese-its cost $18.99. If you use internet on more than two devices they bill you $15 per device. The most disappointing is the lack of filtered water. There is one filthy fountain near the pool (see Pic)  water from the faucet smells of rotten eggs (sulfur-oxide) and they won't provide free water at bars so you will be buying $11 Evian everywhere. If you gamble you can get free beverages but the mixed drinks come in 6-oz cups. If you buy drinks then you will be spending $13 + 18% gratuity for a Miller Lite.    All-in-all I was disspointed in the constant fees. Just own that you are a higher class establishment charge more upfront and provide free basics like water.
50,They Upgraded me to the Actavius room with a view of the Bellagio fountains It was wonderful!!!!!!!! The room was large and new with a spa tub in the bathroom. The hotel is the largest in Vegas with 4 towers so it took a little time finding my way around. I booked O Cirque the Michael Jackson Show. Both are 10 stars!!!!!!!
40,Our family had an overall good vacation; however there was a putrid smell coming from the elevators area at Augustus towers. It turned my stomach every time we needed to use the elevators. I‚Äôm not sure if they had a sewage issue or what.
10,We have stayed at Caesar‚Äôs Palace many times but our most recent stay was awful. Check-in employee was mean and argumentative about us not wanting an upgrade. No housekeeping for our entire four day visit despite asking at check in. Water at the pool is 11.00 (they search you to make sure you don‚Äôt bring your own) and pool chair rental starts at 20.00. Their rewards program is non-existent and customer service is very hard to find. The room rates are high stay somewhere nice and avoid Caesar‚Äôs Palace.
10,Get ready for enormous crowds confusing signage nightmare check-in & out process over-priced EVERYTHING strong sewage smell overall lack of cleanliness being charged separately for anything possible (including just touching items in the mini fridge) no free coffee in room (which I have never experienced) and if you use rideshare or Uber-get ready to walk forever to drop/off & pick up‚Ä¶it‚Äôs by the dumpsters!  Gross expensive low-quality. Never again!
10,"Checked in on 7/16/2022. Requested a wheelchair that we waited for over an hour to be delivered. It was never coming due to understaffing. Then we get to our strip view rooms to find ourselves looking at the freeway and parking lot with a sliver of the Mirage. Because we could see some of the Mirage Caesars considers this a ""strip view"" and made us pay to upgrade to another room with a real strip view. That same night in the casino the power goes out and we're waiting 20-30 minutes before someone came round with instructions not to cash out once the machines power back up. We never got the chance because minutes after that we were running in fear of our lives after hearing gunshots in the casino. The media story was that someone broke a glass door at the MGM and people went running through hotels on the strip causing panic. These hotels are quite a distance away on foot and we actually heard at least 3 shots in the casino whether they want to admit it or not. There are plenty of other guests that heard the shots too. Did I mention of all this is still the same day of check in?! The casino did not reopen until the afternoon of the next day and we were informed that we would not be able to get our money from the machines we were playing because no cash out ticket printed when they were rebooted. The slot manager refused to check the cameras to see us actively playing the machines with obvious credits prior to the outage. I don't need to lie about having $160 worth of credit in the machine. Slot manager offered us nothing other than sorry we can't do anything about the credit. So not only did we barely escape being shot and trampled they offered guests no explanation and kept our money too. I will never stay here again."
10,I just got back from one of the worst experiences in Vegas staying at your hotel. Omar the manager was the most rudest person I have ever met in customer service. My ac was not working and it was running 80 degrees in 108+ weather this weekend. I checked in at 11am on Sunday and we turned the ac to 65 and left for a pool party and then came back at 530ish and it was hot so I called to have it looked at‚Ä¶I had to call 3 times and no one was coming to check on it. I eventually packed my stuff up with my fianc√©s stuff (mind you it was her birthday) we went down there to see if we can change a room and OMAR the manager on site was blaming me that I checked in early so he could t switch us and said that we had to go back up there and deal with it and he will have someone fix it I told him I called the front desk and he laughed in my face saying none answers phones there they are off site. Instead of listening he blamed and laughed at the guest which was me    I have never been treated and experienced anything like this before at a hotel. I came to Caesar‚Äôs palace to get a good experience and all I received was hell. Making me feel dumb and helpless at a ‚Äúluxurious‚Äù hotel. I was in room 1596 on the signature level and I was so bothered I was treated with lack of understanding and rudeness from Omar. So we went back up there and I called front desk again to see when someone was going to come up and again they said sometime soon. I had no time to wait or see if anyone was going to come I felt like NOONE was listening to my request. I eventually saw a maintenance cart and myself I had to ask him to come look. MARK was so helpful in our situation and fixed our ac and replaced to vents and checked everything out for us. That man needs a raise‚Ä¶OMAR not so much. We did receive a resort fee comp. But after this whole fiasco and rudeness by hotel management it was a disaster. How can I ever want to come back or reccomend this place to anyone.    We thought we were coming to experience a vacation of luxury and relaxation for my fianc√©s 31st birthday and we needed up with the worst place to be stayed at in our whole experiences we have had in Vegas. We are so let down by the hotel and the management that was going on there and how we got treated and we are so appalled by what happened I hope carders can make it right. Thank you for your time. If you need for info or anything or if someone higher up can reach out to me with any questions they are more than welcomed to do so.- Gabe C.    Also he was telling me when I was down there why didn‚Äôt I come down and say anything before‚Ä¶.we left for the pool party at 1230pm-1pmish turned down the ac thinking it was going to be cool when we came back and when we came back it was hot at 530ish‚Ä¶that was when we started calling and everything went down hill. Again blaming us for ‚Äúnot saying anything‚Äù‚Ä¶.
30,Stayed here 17 years ago and it was brilliant not so now room superior room Julius tower was tired was okay only. Casino now virtually in the lobby. $50 resort fee and $75 to use the fridge! disappointing
50,Room is very comfortable the view was stunning it worth every penny the Bellagio fountain view upgrade.  Like everywhere in Las Vegas you have to walk a lot to go to a restaurant shop show etc. but this hotel has a great location.  Lobby is very spacious and check in was fast.
10,Horrible service! Could not get room cleaned or fresh towels during our stay- would not expect this from a 4 star hotel that we paid high dollar for(Augustus tower top floor) then they took unauthorized amount from account that took days to get refunded! Called twice to billing department and was on hold for over 20 minutes each time and STILL could not talk to li e person had to email them to get refunded.  Stayed at New York NY. For 3 nights at beginning of trip and service was excellent!!!!!!!  Shame on CEASARS - more expensive clearly does NOT mean better!
10,Omg! It‚Äôs bad enough the $35 resort fee but to charge a $65 Fee for early check in; $85 for late check out at 4pm! Sneaky candy charge if you touch or lift a candy on the tray gets charged to your room; another charge if you use the mini fridge (WTF?)    Bed was hard; pillows lumpy; shower has no drainage so dirty water sits there making a puddle!    You want to check out on the quiosk near elevator you can‚Äôt because it says ‚Äúcheck out as of 8:30 next day!!!‚Äù What about those who paid $85 for late check out at 4pm?? So I drop the cards to room in slot and left! No way would I wait in the humongous line to check out! Absurd!
10,Having stayed at Ceasars many times over the years what can I say? With unwelcoming aging rooms with bare bones amenities to an hour & a half long wait to check in (disabled vet who cannot stand for long periods) & no concern for my comfort/ada issues. With a Keurig in the room but no pods I called down for some K-cups. A bellman appeared with 3 styrofoam cups. ü§¶Staff was rude and they clearly do not have enough people to run the place properly. The rooms are dated & filthy. We had a jacuzzi suite & the floor lamp was covered in 1/4 inch layer of dust. There was no water for them to overcharge us for no notepad or pen. Who doesn't at least have crappy in-room coffee? Cheap...gougeing. Because if they can make you go downstairs & buy a more expensive coffee....they win. Speaking of that...good luck...slots are tighter than can be.  Went through another giant ordeal to check out. No smooth flow to get guests to check-in....just drag your bags (& potentially children) through an active casino. It's 110 degrees outside your guests have just flown across the country hiked miles to ‚úÖ in and you make them sit on a cold lobby floor...  The beautiful showgirl Ceasars was ...is now working a whole other side of the strip....sad. Will not stay again. Only regret is that we didn't read current reviews & find out how bad it's gotten and how much they are overcharging for everything in a desperate attempt to recoup lost COVID revenue? Because yeah they don't make enough $ right?  I literally had a better room at a LaQuinta....in Bakersfield. The crowds have changed also. What used to be an elegant gaming experience has now turned into just another weird parade of sleaze.  Don't go.
10,Poor customer service from Tangela will not visit again. Other hotels in Vegas try to be more friendly and helpful instead of so rude. It was my wedding night too seemed such a sour way to end an lovely day by staying here. The hotel also gave us no view and room was unclean
20,The summary is that Caesar‚Äôs customer service is awful‚Ä¶.  There were 3 rooms reserved in our party and none of our rooms were available at check-in upon arrival on a Monday late evening/early morning. We were all delirious from flying in so late waited 30 mins in a line to check in only to find out that we had to be given different rooms than what we reserved and in 3 different towers so nowhere near each other. One of the rooms given to two in our party smelled so heavily like marijuana that the people before them must have smoked in there for days. Another person in our party woke up to sirens going off because the room next theirs was flooding.    We had to spend a large part of our first morning there sorting out our rooms being told we had to check out of our substitute rooms by 11 because they were booked for others but not being offered our reserved rooms until check in time 4 hours later‚Ä¶ Of the many staff that we spoke to not one cared or was helpful or empathic other than the manager Jasmin at the front desk. We finally felt heard by her.  There is a strong sewer smell in parts of the casino and in the hallway to Augustus and Octavius towers. People literally plug their noses at times it is so strong.  While the view of the pools from our Octavius tower room was impressive I was 100% not impressed with Caesar‚Äôs overall. It is clear that they herd people through there like cattle and we heard many other stories of room issues while chatting with others. Do not recommend.
10,When Caesars changed hands the decline had begun but we weren‚Äôt prepared for how horrible it was. We stayed in a very large suite and would have been better off at a Best Western. The halls through the rooms smelled like raw sewage only to be outdone by the smell of weed wafting throughout the halls and into our room. It was like the set of a Cheech and Chong movie. The air conditioning was rationed on a day that was 110 degrees. It was hot in our room all night. Staff at check were rude. They charged us 50 dollars to check in at 2 versus 4 all after the pleasure of standing in a check in line that was 100 people long. Nobody to help with bags and we had to drag our heavy bags over their dirty carpet for a half a mile to get to the room. Restaurants in the hotel not the Forum shops were TERRIBLE and expensive. Everything about the experience was bad and low low end. We stayed at The Cosmo the night before we checked into Caesars and had none of these problem. Clearly Caesars doesn‚Äôt know how to run a high end hotel experience anymore. They should drop their rates then if they are trying to be Harrahs or Rio. You‚Äôd do better anywhere else and pay less.
10,I‚Äôll NEVER stay again!! 11 dollar water!! 10 dollar soda? Be careful not to get thirsty in your room  !! Over priced smelled awful in our tower and the fees!! I can‚Äôt even describe! I was there 3 night and was a big mistake
30,I mean it's Caesar's right? The lobby is beautiful and our room was spacious and relatively clean. Of course you will be subject to resort fees no access to a fridge (it's filled with mini bar items - be careful if you move one because you will be charged for it) and expected to pay for any K-cups you may use for coffee. If you go the the Colosseum for a show expect to pay $10 for a bottle of water and $19.95 for 6oz of cheap wine. I get that this how most of Vegas runs but don't they get enough from fleecing the gamblers that they have to fleece their guests too?
50,Spectacular experience as it always has been and continues to be at Caesars. From friendly check-in/check-out beautiful and clean room fantastic room view of Bellagio Fountains good variety of games and gaming floor is always clean. Table minimums are relatively high (starting at $25/bet) but helps encourage serious players who know the games and strategies. We love everything about this property and ESPECIALLY the people who work there.
50,Massive resort. Use mobile check in if possible! There was a host to help with the kiosk and he was friendly and actually helpful.  Our room faced the strip ~woohoo~ a Julius jr Suite. The room was nice. A little banged up but a nice 2 room suite. No water closet.  Because we faced the strip the room was noisy. I swear I could hear music coming through the ducts. Luckily I brought earplugs. We were on a lower floor too so that may have been why.  We only stayed a night so we didn‚Äôt need housekeeping. Our room only had one towel so I asked the housekeeper as she passed by if we could have another towel or 2 and she said ‚Äúno you have to call for one.‚Äù So I did and it took 3 hrs for one towel. Oh well not that big of a deal.  Lots to do at Caesars. I‚Äôll definitely be back!
30,Couldn't get in my room as night security latch was engaged from inside. Front desk was NO help. After waiting 2 hours finally got hold of security. Anthony Jay and locksmith handled it in 5 minutes. Keurig in room no coffee will sell you 3 pods=$20 + tax. No pen notepad or tissues. No telling what they'd charge for that. Food & drinks extremely overpriced even by Vegas terms. Won't be back there.
20,The front desk was way understaffed. I waited 30 minutes + to check in. They take advantage of you by charging you for early checkin despite the fact that they clearly have available rooms. The room was disgusting. The headboard was ripped. The bathroom had inlays missing from the vanity and water damage to the door frames. The room safe didn‚Äôt work and needed to be serviced 3 times in two days.
10,We were there 7/10/22 for dinner buffet without reservations The female guider said come back tomorrow at 3pm . We came back next day before 3pm in the second place of the line.  4 pm the buffet was opened they told us standing in the wrong line . They called the manager come to help. The manager told 9 of us to go back down to the last place of the line. We were there before 3 pm we had to stay behind people came at 4pm . Lack of organization üò´
10,Elevators didn‚Äôt work took 45 minutes just to get up to our room. The whole casino smells like backed up sewer. The furniture is trashed. The air conditioner didn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs not worth it. This is not the Caesar‚Äôs Palace it used to be
50,I was so nervous to book our room based on all the reviews but all that worry was wasted. This resort is first class from check in to check out. Perfect 3 nights. I travel a lot (Hilton Diamond and Hyatt Globalist) so I am discriminating.    Here is a quick recap and some tips highlighting the awesome location:    -Bell Car Service: Stops at a liquor store so you can pick up water/supplies.  Once at Caesars Bellman service is unbelievable!!    -Check in/Room : Super Easy used the $20 trick (actually a $100) and was upgraded to an Octavius Executive Suite room 6758. Spectacular views of the fountain and mountains via floor to ceiling windows. Perfectly clean room with constant housekeeping. Had two refrigerators which was very helpful for our booze:)    -Gordon Ramsey Pub: Okay not the best food for lunch.    -Steakhouse in Caesars: Room service very good dinner.    -Maverick Helicopter to Grand Canyon: A must. Easy pickup. Get the first flight  and sit in the front row next to the pilot.    -Black Jack in Fortuna Pool: VERY fun do!    -Eiffel Tower Restaurant : Taxi across-very easy. Upcharge for window table worth  the price.    -Cirque O: Walk across the street. So very unbelievable! Section 104 Row A seats 1  and 2 were perfect.    -Hop on/off Bus: Walk across the street. Get first bus. Was very informative and  fun! You can bring drinks onboard.    -High Roller: Same location as Hop on Bus so good to do after.    -Mayfair Supper Club: Walk across the street. This is an Experience! The reviews  aren't all good but I think the reviewers were missing the point of the 'bad'  performers. Still laughing. Or maybe they weren't trying to be bad :) either way a  ton of fun. Get a table in the middle of the front room facing the stage.    Please stay here you will be so happy you did! Aesthetically the whole hotel is gorgeous and so interesting.    Thank you Caesars Palace for a beyond perfect stay! Ironically my company is having their annual conference here in March so I get to return!!
20,Where do I begin‚Ä¶ we had to stay here a total of 9 nights for a dance convention. They made our stay so incredibly difficult. From booking to check out every single experience was painful. I was staying with two children so I was sure to ask ahead of time for a fridge and a rollaway. I spent an hour on the phone with the booking agent gave her my Caesars rewards number and she assured me this is not a problem. I get to the hotel at about 2pmcheck in is at 4. My room was not ready until 530pm. I wasn‚Äôt given an apology or any reasoning why after traveling all day we just wanted to get into our room. Then our room has no rollaway no fridge no coffee maker. The front desk says they don‚Äôt even offer rollaways. Well I had friends in other rooms at the hotel with rollaways so they flat out lied to me.. I went to Walmart the following day and purchased a blow up mattress and a fridge for our room. Still no coffee maker. About day 5 I finally got a coffee maker. At the Giadia coffee shop I was given hot water daily then on the last three days they stated hot water was $4! $4 for hot water! üò©. At check out I had numerous charges that were not mine and also noticed my reward number was not there. They directed me to call and they could add it for me. After spending an hour on hold they said they couldn‚Äôt add it I had to email. Now I emailed they said they can‚Äôt add it either!! This place is so mismanaged I can‚Äôt even begin to explain how bad it is. I am also a travel agent so I know how service is supposed to be and this place is horrible for the money we paid. So incredibly bummed ‚òπÔ∏è
10,A visit filled with regrets from choosing this hotel. Octavious Tower 50th floor. Pics and video recording show the intensity of soiled pillows bed items. Telephone was so filthy & looked like it hadn‚Äôt been cleaned in a very long long time. My review might perhaps be questionable if we didn‚Äôt have the pics & recording footage. Unsanitary with a much needed remodeling. At the very least housekeeping should have informed management so sofa pillows bed linens and telephone could have all been replaced. Certainly will never stay here. I
30,Ok Caesars now has the taxis out front in a remote parking lot that you have to walk too from the lobby you have to dodge cars and other traffic just to get to the taxi lot there are no over head canopy and the worst part is you have to wheel your luggage all the way over to this remote lot its so stupid now they all don't have food service at the pools they tell you to download an app and order from your phone great but the wifi by the pool sucks and food selections were horrible I have been to many Vegas pools an always was able to have the wait staff order for us Very disappointed there were other issues with a strong sewer smell by the Augustus tower elevators ALL I CAN SAY IS I WAS VERY disappointed with our Stay and going forward I will stay somewhere else. Needs improvement badly and with the staff I talked too they said upper management says there are no complaints and everything is great the typical line they give their employees No things aren't good at Caesar's and Won't be back anytime soon Cosmopolitan Bellagio way better.
10,This was probably the worst stay at any hotel I have experienced. After waiting in line to check-in for at least 45 minutes (after I had checked in online for 5 rooms but the kiosks weren't working to get room keys) we were greatly disappointed by every aspect of this hotel. A fountain view for my daughter's 25th birthday was of a highway behind the hotel. The line every day for the elevator was anywhere from 20-30 minutes while waiting in a hallway that smelled like raw sewage. Once on the elevator it stopped at every floor and only 2 out of 6 were functional in the Octavius Tower. We started using the stairs which dumped you in a parking lot out back and then we had to walk in the 110 degree heat back into the hotel. An elevator would never come to get down from our floor. The internet NEVER worked however then was charged on one room an extra fee. 3 of the rooms were never cleaned even though we requested housekeeping daily. They had to hunt down the housekeepers for fresh towels. Our beds were never changed the entire stay. The same stains on the bed cover were there upon arrival and departure. Forget ever being able to call the front desk or concierge and get an answer. One of our rooms had a broken Keurig machine. And you have to buy coffee pods to have a cup of coffee in your room. Why bother even having it there? I have never stayed in a hotel that charged for a coffee pod when a coffee machine is in your room. The refrigerator was broken and never fixed in one room and NO snacks were ever put in the room to buy ever. When complaining to the Manager he claimed he knew nothing about sewer smell. elevators etc. Well then maybe you should be fired from your job since you only have to walk up the hallway to see and smell this debacle. He claimed the elevator was broken for one day. So One day the line was so long for the elevator that a security guard came and took us a mile to a service elevator (that we waited at least 15 minutes for as well in the heat) and he told me the elevators have been not working for at lest 3 weeks but the hotel manager is unaware of this. REALLY??? Save your money and do not stay at this hotel. Our taxi driver told us it is the worst managed hotel on the strip and I would greatly concur.
20,Stayed one night for a quick getaway. We upgraded our room and it was not worth the $400 a night price. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom has no venting and the room felt humid/stuffy. Our shower would not work/turn on.. we saw leaking through the knob. Front desk was rude and seemed to not care. He offered $35 off the bill. When you spend $400 for a suite not enough. The room is also .75 miles from self parking. The resort fee gets you wifi for two devices and access to the pool. Didn‚Äôt go to the pool so it was expensive. Would have been happier if customer service was better. Will be staying at another hotel when we come back in the fall.
10,"Back in January I came to Caesars for the first time and stayed in a filthy room next to an employee closet entrance and I complained. From my complaint Caesars gave me 2 free nights in an ""upgraded room"" that I used along with a paid night this past weekend. Upon arrival from my flight  room wasn't ready early but wasn't offered to pay to check in early they said they would call when room was ready. Waited almost 4 hours in the heat and called to check on room. Low and behold the room had been ready I just never received a call. Upon making my way to the room the hallways smelled like sewage. The sewage smell didn't stop the entire 3 days we were there. My ID didn't work to identify me at check in or checkout kiosks and I had no barcode or anything else. The room wouldn't cool off and I opened the intake door to see over a years worth of dust in it. My husband's players card stopped working after day 1  my room was filthy and housekeeping literally barged in 30 mins after check in whilst I was in underwear. I Could go on and on. Do not stay here. You've been warned."
30,"One of the best hotel rooms we've ever had in Vegas was around 10 years ago when we stayed at Caesar's Palace. It was truly an amazing place. However the impression we got from Caesar's on our visit last week was completely different. Granted we didn't stay at Caesar's but we did go there a couple of times: to pick up our Chris Rock tickets and to attend the Chris Rock show.    The night of the Chris Rock show we got there a few hours early so that we could do some gambling and have dinner (Trevi @ Forum Shoppes) before the show. We wanted to pick up a player's club card for one member of our party and the line at the Caesar's Total Rewards desk was ridiculous. There was a separate line for some of the higher tiers but for the gold tier there must have been at least 20 people in line. To make matters worse there was a family of three (mom dad adult daughter) that stood up there at the desk for at least a half an hour with some sort of issue that the desk clerk was unable to handle. After waiting in line for at least a half an hour we left to get dinner. We came back an hour later to find the exact same thing. This time we waited almost 40 minutes and finally got a new card. Needless to say we did not have much time to gamble before it was time to go to the show. Just think of how much money they lost by keeping us in line for over 70 minutes!!    Then at the Colosseum the employees admitting people to the theatre were very very slow so much so that they had to start the show an hour late. And it's not like they were understaffed they had plenty of people but they were very slow and inefficient.    Fast forward to 10:30 pm the Chris Rock show is over time to go back to our hotel. Hundreds of people walk from the theatre to the front door to catch a taxi and..........no taxis. Just a series of signs that led everyone on a scavenger hunt of sorts through the front yard ""maze"" of Caesar's to a remote spot where everyone had to wait for a cab. This might have been O.K but there was no line of cabs just one driving by every 5-10 minutes. And a Caesar's employee trying to hook up individual customers and groups with car services driving black Escalades at $75-100 per ride. All of this was very sketchy and un-Caesar's like in our opinion. This is the first time in over 30 years that we have left a show at a casino and not had a line of cabs waiting to take people wherever they needed to go.    Fast forward again to July 4th. Somehow Caesar's had the exclusive on fireworks displays. In other words they were the only casino that was going to have a display and it was going to start at 8:00 pm sharp. Thousands of people lining the streets (we watched from Bellagio) in eager anticipation of the awesome display that only a casino like Caesar's could provide! 8:00 pm goes by no fireworks. 8:30 no fireworks. 9:00 no fireworks. Oh wait around 9:05 pm a few fireworks were fired up from the Julius Tower and it was over in about 6-7 minutes. Very very disappointing. We've seen MLB ballparks that have had better displays on a random Friday night and local cities throughout the country that have put on better displays.    I guess what we're getting at here is........Caesar's needs to get their act together. MGM Properties is beating them at their own game they have better casinos better restaurants better staff a better rewards club. Caesar's is not what it once was and aside from the occasional headline act there is really no reason to spend much time there anymore."
10,Check-in sucks they have kiosks with one or two actual people if you are not a diamond member they make you walk close to the street to catch a cab (my luggage wheel broke off) do not move any of the mini bar items they have sensors and the hotel will charge you automatically plus if you move the stuff to keep your food cold the charge you $75 to use the fridge. Also there is no longer a human concierge. Made us leave our drinks before entering the pool. Pool drinks are 30 bucks each and you have to pay to get a seat. Too expensive no customer service
20,Casino food cleanliness bell hop and the amount of things to do were AWESOME! There was easy access to restaurants and the Forum. Folks at the front desk were not so great and neither was their hospitality! Actually they were quite rude. I was there with my team stood in a long line several times to rectify an issue with my school's credit card versus my personal credit card and then again for card key issue. There was no one available to assist you with an ongoing issue to get things done in a timely fashion. One time stood when I stood in line- I was asked to get an ID from my room although my card key did not work. During the time I arrived until the time I left approximately 4 days I stood in line 6 times every time was over 25 minutes and twice for nearly an hour. Also the gym is only opened from 6am to 5pm. There was only one set of weights for each 5lbs 10lbs 15lbs... The gym was always packed and most times had to wait up to 30 minutes for a treadmill or weights. I felt like I spend so much time waiting rather than in presentations or doing something fun! I do plan to return to ISS next year but will be staying elsewhere!
20,We booked our room in a newer tower with an early check-in. When we arrived the rooms were not ready. The lady at check in said we could check in if we upgraded our rooms. $90 per night for each of the rooms. We declined and went to the pool. I went to get my room keys at 3:00 one of the rooms were not ready and I was told we were now in the furthest and one of the oldest towers. We were with a large group that had to meet in the lobby several times a day for functions. It would have been very close to our reserved rooms but it was a 10 minute walk from the rooms we received. We did not get the keys to our second room until almost 4:00. They also never texted as promised when the rooms were ready I had to go and ask each time. The rooms were old beat up missing paint and finish on the walls and furniture. They smelled musty and smoky. Not great for the price. So many nicer hotels for much less. Also went to sigh up for the gambling rewards card and was told I don't need one basically shooed away from the desk. The man said I would only want one if I gambled a lot or was going to return to the hotel. I replied that I guess I would not be returning then. He just smiled and I walked away.
50,Got in line at 1:06am - got a room at 3:50am - STOOD in line for 2 hours 54 minutes. Ended up with a room in wrong tower far away from my conference and a single rather than the reserved double. The only bright star in this awful morning was Tangela - she was patient and pleasant and as accommodating as she could be - given what she had to work with. There was a lot of griping and complaining in the very long line with only two people working the desk - she took it all in stride. Do something for these front desk workers Caesars! They deserve better and so do your customers! Unacceptable! The Caesars service was one star but Tangela gets 5 stars.
50,So after having a pretty bad and tiring day driving into Vegas from LA. We were upgraded to their suite room upon check in. It was unbelievable. We had a huge room with a tub and a steam sauna in our room! They took care of everything and the price was very reasonable too. Surely staying again
20,Wasn't very impressed with the room as it was. Plus I felt like there's a lot of hidden charges. The worst of it though was they make you walk outside the hotel cross hotel traffic to a remote taxi pickup/drop off location. Absolutely horrible!
20,AVOID THIS CASINO. VERY HIGH PRICED .EXORBITANT ROOM AND RESORT FEES. VERY EXPENSIVE VALET AND SELF PARK . Hard to find reasonable restaurants. The atmosphere by the staff is a money-grabbing one. $65 buffet. $23 weak drinks at the pool. No shade spots at the pool. Most pools were well over 90 degrees. Only one pool is cooled. Skip this place
20,Beautiful place but not exactly what we expected. Only two devices can be used with free wifi otherwise up charge. Check in early.. up charge request late check out.. up charge. Request to change rooms because of the clogged sink and ripped head board.. up charge. The pool is absolutely gorgeous but they close at 6pm. They have 2 pools but you‚Äôre allowed only to go to one otherwise.. yup up charge. Next time we will just visit but definitely won‚Äôt be staying here at up charge palace.
20,Three words sum it up: not worth it. We were SO excited to stay here in the decades that we‚Äôve visited Las Vegas Caesars was always on our list‚Ä¶maybe that‚Äôs the problem: high expectations that weren‚Äôt met excepting the room. This was a trip over Father‚Äôs Day weekend; arrived Saturday and departed Monday. First time staying here.    In order:  Valet/parking: Came in at the strip entrance. Obviously expect VERY busy on a Saturday afternoon one has to be very patient. The parking valet asked if we were Seven Stars members of the Caesars Rewards club we were not. Surprise! You have to pay $50 a day for valet!! I‚Äôm NOT cheap but I am principled on certain things and would rather drive & stroll through the casino than pay that outrageous price. Should be included in the already mandatory resort fee. Self-parking is on the west side & really wasn‚Äôt too far. And yes you pay for that too‚Äî$18/day. We strongly recommend using the bellman for luggage the poor souls who don‚Äôt will carry and wheel theirs for a good distance no matter how you park.    Room/check in: Super long line went to try kiosk. Learned that check in starts at four pm or yes that‚Äôs right it‚Äôs an additional fee to check in early: $55! At this point we‚Äôre feeling a bit price gouged‚Ä¶already paying a lot for the room & resort fee.    Another very positive note: Christina a six-year front desk employee working the desk near the express kiosks told me there was no difference in using the kiosk to check in. When I saw the $55 fee I walked away & she asked if it worked I said yes but $55? It was three pm Christina said I‚Äôll help and she did-checked us in early without charge. Another strong recommendation: TIP THE PEOPLE WHO HELP YOU! We tipped $20.    We watched a bunch of YouTube videos of the property & rooms and booked the Augustus towers overlooking the Bellagio fountain. Splurged a bit for the room but the value is mostly in the view wow! That‚Äôs the one VERY positive aspect‚Äîcannot beat that view of the south strip and to have the perspective of a live aerial view when the fountain starts is awesome. We stayed on the 44th floor.    That being said the room wasn‚Äôt all that big and needs refurbishment. See the photos. Usually I don‚Äôt care all that much but Caesars bills itself as a premier resort. And as others said a Keurig but no pods of coffee?!?! Very lame. We travel with a small pod coffee maker & pods (saves us 20/day and an early morning line-standing) so we just used our Kcups. Another annoyance is the fridge/snack bar. Don't touch anything or they'll charge you. And don't use the fridge for your own purposes or they charge you--$75 (a departure from the frequent $50-$55 we saw elsewhere for parking and early chek in!)    Everything mostly worked in the room but not the desk phone an obvious issue that maintenance or housekeeping should catch. It was completely dead. The room was very quiet ice maker worked great & hallway not long in the tower so that is nice.    Food: we booked a reservation at Gordon Ramsay Pub. The food was very good I posted a Yelp review on that. However service was at best two out of four stars. They had plenty of servers so I no longer feel that the pandemic-related ‚Äújust be glad to go out‚Äù standard applies. If a three drink two entree meal costs $200 don‚Äôt make the customers ask for something simple as water refills. We‚Äôre very big tippers and when we get less than service it‚Äôs a loss to them. Wife ordered the three course meal & strawberry mule cocktail. The drink was fabulous. The Caesar salad was perfect beef Wellington & sides were very good but took a while to arrive & was then inexplicably served warm not hot. My fish & chips was great fresh perfectly cooked non-greasy fries all good. See meal photos.    Three courses‚Ä¶dessert NEVER arrived. Waited twenty minutes after dinner plates cleared told waiter we wanted the check. He seemed surprised and said ‚ÄúI can go see if it‚Äôd ready& box to go‚Äù. We just took the check. Good management this place DOESN‚ÄôT have. If it did they would‚Äôve removed the cost of the dessert they didn‚Äôt.    Pools: Opulent-looking and there are a few of them. However when you look closely you'll see a lack of maintenance. Paint peeling things looking as though they've not had attention. Also though the crowd isn't a bunch of twenty-somethings on holiday they pipe in the rave-like music. Just a personal preference I'd rather hear something like reggae if I'm looking to chill poolside.    Overall/Final Thoughts: Though the view from the room was special it ended there. When paying that much for the room things like parking early check-in coffee fridge use etc. should be included. Just didn't feel good about all the extra surprising upcharges. And they need to improve upon maintenance of the place including the rooms. Glad we went but won't be back.
10,Recently stayed at Caesar‚Äôs Palace for a couples vacation to celebrate our anniversary. We got married a few years ago at Caesar‚Äôs Palace and like to return every year. This year was by far the worst stay for us it felt like a complete waste of money!  First was emailed a check in so I wouldn‚Äôt have to wait in the horrendous check-in line. Upon our arrival at 12am the self check in kiosks close at 10:30! That would have been helpful information up front! Waited for one of three representatives on duty for 45 mins to finally get our keys to our room!  Finally we check into our room upon arrival we notice our bed is rock hard! I mean you could bounce a quarter off it! Too tired and hungry to care. I forgot to mention the room was hot as outside so we crank the AC and go look for something to eat!  Upon our return with full bellies of of horrible casino pizza because that‚Äôs all there is to eat at 1:30am if you‚Äôre too tired to walk anywhere else! I walk into the bathroom and almost slip! I notice there is water all over the floor the sink everything! Open the cupboard below the sink and notice a rag tied around the pipes? Hmmm is this a reoccurring problem? The whole cupboard is filled with water.  Quickly call front desk tell them our bathroom is flooded and that AC is not working! Says she will send someone up to look at it! And replace the 10 towels we used to soak up the water!  Complained to the representative who only could offer her apologies and at that point just needed some rest after a long day of travel. The next day we notice the smell of sewage in the walkway to the palace rooms and to the elevator!  This room was not worth 300.00 per night the paint is chipping on the ceiling the comforter had stains on it and the entertainment stand was chipped with chunks of wood laying on the floor! I am so disappointed that this is where I spent my hard earned money! I couldn‚Äôt even pick up a players card because the line up was so long every time I went.  Caesars do BETTER! I work hard for my money and wanted to have a relaxing vacation with a beautiful room! Instead it smelled like sewage the entire time and the bed was rock hard!!!!! Will not recommend to anyone and will not be back! Which is sad since I got married at Caesar‚Äôs‚Ä¶
20,Really disappointing Trip from the start. Staff is RUDE unless you‚Äôre Diamond Member or higher. Hard to get staff on phone. Rooms not cleaned. Service was Terrible. Bad casual Dining choices. One person was helpful Ricardo. Thank you !!!
50,I've stayed in Caeser for years now and I recently stayed for the 4th of July weekend. When I got into my room it was not the best. Scraped up furniture hidden trash clothes from previous guests and more. Not only did I have problems with the room but also bell desk. I talked to customer service and they didn't do much. That was until Lyndsey G. the Guest Service manager came out and talked to us. She gave us offers such as food offers as an apology on the house. She also helped us change rooms first thing in the morning for us which was great. The new room was nice and had a good view. This was the service I appreciated. Lyndsey was very kind a professional when she spoke to us. Bell desk spoke to us and cleared up with the misunderstanding. Everything was fine as long as I got a good room and have my belongings. This is why I always stay at Caesers.
10,Staff their are very unprofessional and they don‚Äôt know anything about their job  They charge for the parking even if you have the application of rewards  The staff in the checkout she just wanna charge extra money for nothing  I have paid already the parking and still she wants confirmation otherwise she ll charge . How can u leave with ur car without paying !!  Very stupid !!    Only location in good
10,Check in was a nightmare. Over an hour standing in line to check in - checking in online didn't work checking in on the app didn't work. Long line for check in kiosks and those didn't work either.    The room (Forum Tower) is in poor shape - walls floors and furniture beat up peeling broken or scuffed. The remote curtains don't work. Holes in the bedsheets and in bed itself.    The whole Palace Tower area near the pool smells very strongly of sewage which appears to be a chronic problem from other reviews.    We did not receive housekeeping service the first day. We did not have a do not disturb sign so that wasn't the issue and we were out of the room all day so that wasn't it either. When we called the front desk the next day to request it they told us we didn't have a reservation and they couldn't request housekeeping without a reservation. But we had checked in 2 day before been in our room 2 nights already and had 1 night of stay left. But nope no reservation = no housekeeping. But we were ok to stay there reservation free I guess. üòÜ And then housekeeping did actually finally come so there's the silver lining.    Their own internet is very poor and only two devices per room can connect - after that there is a $15 fee. No cell network service so you have to connect to their network. But their network isn't great so good luck with that. Here for a work conference and could not consistently get the internet to be functional enough to download the presentation materials so that was frustrating.    You can only use one pool - unless you pay an $85 fee for the others. Free pool closes at 6 PM.    It costs $5 to make coffee in your room $20 if you want several k cups some stir sticks and creamer.    Want to use the mini fridge to keep water snack or food cold? - $30/day    Check in early - $20 or maybe $50 fee (depends on who checks you in)    Check out late - $20 fee    ...those last two are fairly typical but the others are bizarre.    We did have great dining experiences everywhere within the hotel. The Qua spa was also lovely...extra fees that weren't disclosed up front there too but at least it was a high quality experience.    I stayed in The Venetian this year and experienced none of these fees and accomodations were much much better.    In fact I've had better accomodations at a Motel 6. This is not a hotel I will choose to stay at for future visits to Las Vegas.
50,Front desk maria diza was very friendly helpful and knowledgeable. My whole interaction was smooth and she answered all of my questions before I even needed to ask them. Great customer service skills  Manager Lynette was also very helpful and assisted me with a minor issue at check out.  The service provided made me feel like a valued customer.
30,Hotel was nice upgraded room nice. I was explained what my charges would be upon check in i.e. room; upgrade; resort fee and taxes. Upon check out I get an email from my bank stating a fraudulent charge of $165.48 was made to my card by Caesars Hotel. Upon checking out I was told that it was an additional charge for who knows what her explanation made no sense and neither did the charge. This was early morning 6am and we had to get to the airport. Hence a reservation charge that started out before this added amount was $800.00 plus for 4 nights ending up being $923.84. I truly believe this is something they do often so please be aware. Other than that the stay was okay just very very expensive. I don't mind paying but don't want to be cheated.
50,Great place to stay in the middle of the strip and close to everything and the shopping mall in the ground floor is amazing  also the club is just a perfect spot for couples or a group of friends the cab is about $30 to the airport and the Uber is about the same.
50,First visit to Vegas on a girls trip. Looked at a few hotels and decided to stay at Caesars. Quite surprised by a lot of the negative reviews on here as we thought the hotel was great! The hotel is huge so there is a bit of a walk to your hotel room but its expected given the size. Once you find a direct route its not that bad.    Pros:    Spacious clean room - stayed in the Palace premium studio room which is right by the pools - was perfect for 4 girls - lots of room with two separate toilets connected by a walk through shower and a large tub. No issues with noise etc. View of the pool area from the window    Great location - right in the middle of the strip    The staff were all very pleasant    7 pools - although the water was cold!    Omnia nightclub on site - great night out and an awesome club    Forum shopping complex within the hotel    Cons:    Check in was a tad long but we didn't mind as we were all just happy to be in Vegas plus slightly delirious after being up for nearly 24 hours! They do have a self check kiosk but it didn't seem to work.    Asked if the mini fridge could be emptied - unable to do so as owned by an external company. We did ask for an additional fridge but they charged around $10 per night    Free Wifi only available for 2 devices - have to pay for additional devices yet wifi is free for all in the communal areas of the hotel - casino shopping complex etc.    Pool water is cold! (we travelled over Easter)    Food court - only 3 options were open    Although there are a few cons - which you would expect at any hotel overall I would 100% recommend staying at Caesars and I would definitely stay here again on my next visit to Vegas. Ignore all the negativity!
20,Here for a conference: check in was at least 150 people deep $75 just to USE the mini fridge ice machines broken in food court and floor 54. One of three elevators continuously stops one floor at a time (maintenance is aware) super expensive pool drinks ($30 mojito $125 for six pack of beer) pool water freezing even on a 108 degree day. Three food court restaurants closed rooms are charged an extra $50 a night for a ‚Äúresort fee‚Äù. Stupid expensive.
20,We booked a king and received a double queen and we were so tired of walking through the smoke filled lobby that made us and our clothes stink badly that decided not to go back. The food was limited after 9pm and what we did order at Bobby's was a bust. Burger was undercooked and the fries were soggy feel free to look elsewhere
40,Was assigned a terrace view room but reservation was for pool view. Had to get in the front deak line again next day to get it fixed. Caesars should have done that automatically instead of wasting guests time for their mistake.
20,I recently stayed at Cesar‚Äôs palace . It was my fianc√©s first time and unfortunately I was not satisfied for the amount of money I paid. I was asked to upgrade for a much better view . There was no view and after being told it would be 140 extra I was charged 429. The top of our bed was full of dust and there was broken glass which cut my hand . My fianc√© who just returned from deployment didn‚Äôt want me to complain since he feels becaue of Covid some things are missed but I was very disappointed .
10,-Poor customer service at the front desk during check-in. The website/company sent absolutely NO reminders that there was a balance to be paid prior to my check-in (or else I wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to check-in).  Nor did the site ALLOW ME to pay the balance in full prior to my stay.    -After a LONG and ARDUOUS check-in process I was FINALLY led to my quarters where I was greeted with a FILTHY NASTY room.    Apparently their excuse was that they were short-staffed & couldn‚Äôt get to clean the rooms in-time.  For all that I had to pay for this stay this was indeed    UNACCEPTABLE.    -Took them FOREVER to situate me in another room. When I FINALLY got to my new room the shower and drain were not working properly.    GO FIGURE.    The bottom line for me is that this hotel was ALL hype and absolutely NO substance whatsoever.    I would have had a better time at a Holiday Inn or Hampton Inn. Even a Motel 6 would have been better than this overpriced DUMP.    ZERO STARS would NOT recommend. Period.
30,Here for a work conference. So excited to stay at Caesar‚Äôs palace. They are crazy busy. Surprised when I walked into my room and right on the white sink was grown man‚Äôs like huge eyebrow hair. Ew. Hair grosses me out. Hopefully the next clean is better. Also just surprised how best up the building is but  I didn‚Äôt realize how old it is. Just needs a coat of paint in some places. I‚Äôm looking forward to enjoying the pool and other activities when I can.
20,"What a huge disappointment. I booked ""the best"" tower with a pool view. 8 days was over $4k. The entire 8 days there was a stench of sewage in the hall leading to my room and to the pool. I reported the issue to more than 10 hotel staff w/o resolution.  Other bad stuff: There's a coffee maker in the room but the coffee is in the ""mini bar"" so $5 for a cup of coffee in the room!!!  Next Parking is very expensive.  Next: the pools (all of them) are freezing cold. Even Vegas heat couldn't make up water that cold.  Next: Someone made a second reservation with my name - I luckily found the separate charge and had the hotel investigate and remove charges BUT I had to cancel my credit card etc. Ugh.  Finally staff. Pool staff was lovely. Everyone else in the building seemed to be annoyed by the people visiting.  I'll never go to a Caesars property again."
10,Was the worst experience ever we arrive and nobody was at the reception to open us the door thanks god a family staying in the same hotel arrive at 9 pm (after couple of hours) and provide us the 2 codes to enter to the property. After reaching the reception no body was there so we have to try all the keys and finally choose ourselves the room that best fits our needs. We also have to bother the family to get access to the wifi‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Horrible experience!!!!
40,First time staying here for 2 nights.    I stay in Augustus Tower in a king room. Big room good bed and nice marble title bathroom with jacuzzi tub.    Went to the pool one day and it was very nice and fun! Good Service by the pool Staff.    I would stay here again.
10,I am currently staying here. I‚Äôve been here for a week. The price is ridiculous for what you get. I‚Äôve stayed at much less expensive hotels in smaller cities and gotten way more. I am shocked at what Caesar‚Äôs Palace is able to get away with charging. So here goes‚Ä¶    1. Only 2 devices per room allowed to connect to the Wi-Fi. $14.99/day after that. Oh and forget about using your provider network. No service in the complex. Call reception is terrible and texts don‚Äôt always go through.    2. No USB ports for charging anywhere except for 1 on the desk under the tv.    3. Old TV‚Äôs. Not a smart TV. You can‚Äôt even cast from your phone to your TV so no Netflix or prime or Hulu etc.    4. The hallway to Octavius and Augustus towers smells like a dumpster. What in the world died in the bowels of Caesar‚Äôs Palace and why hasn‚Äôt the stench been rectified???    5. The down escalators from the conference center to the main level have been out of order all week meaning you have to walk them which is the equivalent of descending Mount Everest - they are such a steep hike! So unsafe!!!    6. The pools close at 7:00pm. That‚Äôs when the heat is just bearable enough to be outside so why would you close the pools then?!?!    7. We‚Äôve had to call and request room service if we wanted it. Otherwise the trash collects the towels don‚Äôt get replaced linens don‚Äôt get changed etc.    8. There‚Äôs only 1 visible outlet in the whole room. You have to move furniture if you want to get to the others.    9. Their text service called Ivy is useless. It never responds. Just stay on hold and wait for an operator to help you.    10. If you ask for towels they only allow 3 at a time. Well a lot of us have 4 people in a room so I guess that fourth person is just going to have to drip dry.    11. The tiny fridge is fully stocked. If you need to use it for personal use that‚Äôll be $75/day.    12. Small waters and mini-sodas are $7 each (7.5oz)    I consider myself pretty well traveled having stayed in many cities around the world and from 1 star to 5 star establishments. Caesar‚Äôs Palace is NOT worth the money. The level of greed displayed by this resort especially in such a difficult economic time is disgusting. This was the biggest waste of money I‚Äôve ever spent on a trip. I did not enjoy any of it and will never go back.
50,I have always wanted to stay at Caesars. The room was very nice bed was comfortable. It was everything I hoped it would be! Staff food and atmosphere was really outstanding! I would stay here again in a minute!! There is so much to see and tons of restaurants. Make reservations for your food in advance. Restaurants fill up.
20,"This hotel is definitely trying to recoup its losses during COVID. You are nickeled and dimed for everything! Did you know there is a $17 fee for making your reservation over the phone? If you arrive before 4 pm they only let you have a room if you pay an additional $55 per night ""for an upgrade"". If you don't accept this offer they are rude about it and tell you to come back between 4 and 6 and you have to stand in the long line again (yes they tell you this!). The rooms are outdated and run down. The only friendly people are the guys who hold your luggage and the security guards!"
30,The lady with long dark hair and weird bangs cut short and very straight was the rudest person I have had misfortune to meet. Bought drink at bar and moved to a seated area. She yelled to get a drink through her or move back to sit at bar. We explained I had a back injury and our original seats at bar were now occupied. She replied she didn't care and to order or get out. We left our drinks and left. Didn't go back again and took our business for the rest of the trip to other casinos and bars. Disgraceful
20,My family grown son his wife my husband and our 4 yr old granddaughter stayed recently at Caesars palace. What was good‚Ä¶Gordon Ramsay‚Äôs Pub‚Ä¶ his price fix dinner was excellent! Carmines was decent too though a bit costly. Probably the best best thing about Caesars is a young man named Hans in checkin who was remarkable. He was helpful and efficient and walked us through checkin while multitasking with others.    What was bad‚Ä¶. So many things.  There are no places to sit inside the casino we saw several elder people leaning against the wall because there are not places to rest. In the lobby near elevators  There is little shade at the pool unless you fork out money for a cabana  There is a terrible sewer smell in the connecting hallway between the Julius and Octavius towers.  A cheap breakfast was 26 Dollars!  The phones do not really work you cannot call other rooms  The products are unscented and watery  The mini bar is a joke if you lift something up and take 30 seconds your in room account is charged.One bottle of water was $11!!  Drink tickets even with rewards worth 20 dollars weren‚Äôt enough for a pina colada or strawberry daiquiri and you could not pay difference in cash.    The UBER driver on our way in was right the casinos have cut corners big time to recoup theirs losses during COVID.    If you do go don‚Äôt stay here stay in Bellagio or the Wynn or any of the other newer places Caesar‚Äôs was terrible.    We ate at the lovely Mon Ami Gabi across the street at Paris had one dinner and 4 breakfasts there that were wonderful and the price was half what Caesars charged. Serve was superb!    We are not untraveled either we have stayed across Europe so do not think we are just untraveled.
20,I was disappointed with my trip to Caesars. The hotel isn‚Äôt kept up and it was dirty. Even though I get the rooms for free it isn‚Äôt worth it. Hardly win anything from the casino. Too bad they haven't kept the place up.
50,Amazing hotel which you can do what ever make you happy.  And special thanx to shirley locklin which make our dreams come true . She is the best host ever around the world  And help me every day in my vacation with any of my requests .
40,I upgraded our room to a Palace Premium Studio Suite. It was beyond beautiful üòç. The room was so spacious and the bathrooms are the best. Beds were comfortable and our room was overlooking the pool area. I never wanted to leave the room. The pool at Ceasars are the best I've been to so far. The place is clean and absolutely beautiful.    The con  room came with a coffee maker with no coffee provided but you can go to cvs and buy a box of the pods if you into coffee. No mini fridge so don't expect that.    My only issue with this hotel is that the distance from the front strip to the rooms is very long walk. You would be tired lol. I also hate that the casino smells like weed and cigarettes and very cold. I've stayed at ParkMGM and the hotel casino was smoke free.    I would recommend this hotel once you get a good price.
10,The place was absolutely terrible. I will never ever go back there again. The rooms were dirty. The linen on the bed had blood stains!!! You could only use two devices with free wifi otherwise there was a $14.95 charge per day. For two people with two phones iPad computer etc it‚Äôs impossible to stay in the limit of two devices. A small water bottle in the room cost $11.95 and coffee pods $24.95! There was a coffee maker but no coffee and the coffee pods cost $24.95. The receptionist (s) were rude both checking in and checking out. The lines were long to checkin. We waited 15/20 minutes before our turn came. They addressed us condescendingly as honey dear etc. I am a professional and look for courtesy and professionalism. We paid $419 for the room and got the poorest of service. It‚Äôs an old and deteriorating place with minimal upkeep.
10,I was at the hotel for a conference. The hotel is understaffed resulting in a complete lack of customer service and lack of cleanliness. Rooms and public areas were dirty and run-down. Staff was generally unavailable and when you could find someone they were harried and curt. Various elevators and escalators were broken down during my stay. WiFi was spotty at best. I have traveled for work throughout the pandemic and understand the impact that it has had on the hospitality industry - but I have never seen anything like what is happening at Caesars. I don't care where the conference is I will not stay there again.
30,Did not like the area where we stayed. It always smelled like fish when aproaching the elevators. Also the room was not being cleaned every day as requested. Twice I asked the person in charged and I was told they would send someone but nothing was being done. Too expensive for what you are getting.
20,I arrived at night check in was ok. When in the room I was really down on how run down the place is. the carpet with stains. The doors and hallways crowded with marks and scratches. room service with long waiting times. wrong information about the pool hours over the phone pool opening hours not adjusted to people the are on a convention.... 9am-7 pm. Check out prolongation for 30 not possible unless you pay money.
10,I was at your property for a convention it was awful the lack of customer services at your reception not guest services available horrible wifi service 5 start hotel with a limite of 2 devices when I have 2 phones + laptop for work. Poor reception manager always need to go out because the staff need more training. I work at the hospitality business if you dont love your job please go to another place.
50,All is saw were negative reviews but decided to go and stay here anyway and boy am I glad I didn't listen to the reviews. Check in is simple we only saw long lines on 2 occasions. We opted for the personal experience and go to the desk and glad I did. You had the option of using the kiosk but if you do that then you may have to wait until 4 for check in (which is fine if you want to wait) but we went to the desk and asked if we could check in early...YES there is a fee but it's approximately $55.00 and for a 10:30 check in it was a no-brainer. I mean you will spend that gladly at the pool for alcohol so why not get in your room earlier and go to the pool. Our room was in the Augustus Tower on the 44th floor and overlooked the Bellagio fountain and the mountains and the strip...it was amazing. It was very clean.    Here are some tips with regard to the pools Do NOT worry about a lounge chair especially during the summer months as they get super hot and you wind up sitting at the edge of the pool with your feet in the water or in the pool itself. We saw more people rent those loungers only to vacate them for a poolside seat with feet in water. This was our preferred seating and we enjoyed it so much and met so many people. You are allowed to bring water and ice to the pool and the bar tenders will give you a small glass of ice if you ask. The drinks are expensive there so plan to spend or drink your ice water.    People who complained that they were doing some minor construction on the lobby floor are unreasonable. Vegas is open 24/7 so when realistically is this supposed to occur? It was done during the day and did not inconvenience anyone. Our room cleaning service was exemplary. We had our room cleaned daily and she was lovely and kind and very thoughtful ....she made sure I had clean plastic bag for the ice bucket. Its common sense not to open the frig which is sealed with a sticker..you break the seal and you pay common sense. I brought a collapsible cooler and filled it with ice and put my wine that I bought across the street at CVS (the kind that has a screw top as I didn't have a wine opener) in it as well as water and other beverages we wanted and put the cooler in one of the two bathroom sinks. This worked great and saved me a lot of money on drinks. I got a cup with cover and straw and just re-filled it and walked around with it. I used the jacuzzi hot tub every night but one and it was wonderful. We bought a lot of snacks and a bottle of vodka at CVS and bought lemonade nio and made vodka lemonades ...this saved us a lot of money buying drinks. The casino was immaculate there was not ever even a piece of paper on the ground. The cleaning staff at this Hotel is amazing.    Food-The Americana Cafe had a great breakfast and Will is the waiter to ask for. The breakfast is HUGE so bring your appetites and you actually can get one and split it if you want to save some money. We ate at Nobu and avoided the issue of not having a reservation by sitting at the sushi bar. IT was amazing. We ate at Carmines twice and it was amazing (again share a meal as they are huge). We went across the street to Dunkin Donuts as the line to Starbucks was long ...there is always an alternative...it's Vegas there are people there plan accordingly.  If you walk down the strip toward MGM you can find little shops that sell large waters for cheap again shop there and bring them back to your room and put them in your cooler.    Do NOT waste your money on the monorail use the free monorail as it drops you across the street from MGM and it's a short walk. We wasted $72 before figuring that out. USE the bus it was cheap as well.    Harrahs gives you the best drinks while gambling..full glass of wine and a very strong Jack and Ginger. It is smokey though but that is to be expected.    Shows: GO see Luke Bryan (if you like country music) he is amazing !! He plays for 2 hours straight engages with the audience and everyone gets a front row seat as he walks across scaffolding to get up close and personal for us folks in the back and the whole balcony area even the very top. Can't say enough about this concert. We ordered the tickets on the phone and got a great deal because she gave us broker seats. DO THAT ! Also note people stand up so it doesn't matter where you sit. We saw Shania Twain and we went and purchased the tickets right from Planet Hollywood as it was cheaper than online. WE saw KA and it was great again we purchased the tickets from the venue. It was amazing and so was Shania. Again the people at Shania stand up and dance so be mindful of that.    We rarely waited for the elevator. We never waited for a slot machine. We were never inconvenienced at any time.    We got value for our money the hotel was worth the price and as far as the other costs they are like any other hotel...food is expensive everywhere not just at the hotels.    We had a great time and we will surely be back to Ceasars Palace. We stayed a whole week so if this place was so negative we of all people would have experienced it. It was the best.    Thank you Caesars Palace for a great vacation.
20,We had high hopes for our stay at Caesars BUT we were let down. Upon arriving we were greeted by a gentleman that was no at all friendly. He was only worried about what credit card was going to be on file! once we arrived at our room...we were horrified to see that the bathroom looked like someone had just showered and let the room. There were towels and water all over the floor!!!! Disgusting!!!! We called and woman came up and cleaned BUT we were then worried that nothing else was clean at this hotel!!! Tables carpet BED!!!!!
40,We had a wonderful time at Caesars Palace. It is perfectly located on the strip and a beautiful hotel and casino. Only down sides are that they do not offer $5 and $10 blackjack tables the rooms were a little too hot when we were there and adjusting the A/C did not seem to really work and the ice machine on our floor never worked.
50,In a recent visit to Las Vegas we stayed at Caesars Palace. It was very nice and housekeeping kept the room clean and orderly. However I was disappointed that free morning coffee was not provided with the maker provided in the room. We could have purchased it in the minibar which I pick up and looked at. When the check out bill arrived it included the coffee I looked at but never broke the seal. When I called about the charge I was told that the minibar was weight sensitive and so I was charged by just picking it up. They removed the charge. I was also told that if you pick up so many items even though you don't open them there was a reset fee. All that would have been nice to know when we checked in. Other than that the stay was great.
10,From beginning to end the most miserable hotel I have ever stayed. When I arrived late on Saturday night I was checked into a room in which the phones did not work and the room wreaked of cigarettes.    The phone over the toilet worked and I called the operator and was told to go back to the front desk with my luggage. I dragged my luggage through the casinos back to the front desk to be told I could change rooms at 10 AM the next day.    I slept in my clothes so as not to have to open my luggage in the stink of the room. In the morning I had to wait on line again and was first told my room could not be changed! I asked to speak to a manager who never appeared but was then told by the obnoxious clerk that he would change my room but it was not ready.    I then had to drag my luggage to the valet until my room was ready. At 4 PM with only a few hours of sleep and wearing the same clothes as the day before I had to wait on line AGAIN and was told that my room was not ready so I would be moved to s ready room finally.    Everything after this was just the same.    Terrible service.    Uncaring staff.    No management presence.    Caesar‚Äôs does not have to care since they make so much in their other revenue streams like slot machines.    It is not a hotel.    It is a disgusting dormitory for people who want to gamble.    Not once was I offered a comp or discount on my room.    The General Manager should be ashamed of his hotel except that I am sure the profits justify the atrocious service.    Sad to see the hotel business reduced to this miserable state.
40,We came for 2 nights.  On our last day I requested housekeeping service at 1130am advising we weee out of room. We returned at 830p and room was not made. Via Ivy Texting requested fresh towels but not all were delivered. Spoke to a Manager that evening. More towels were being delivered at 115. Do not rely on Ivy texting for this purpose.
50,Me and my lover rented a pool cabana here. Mitch was our concierge and knocked it out of the park. He not only anticipated our needs but exceeded our expectations. We wanted lunch and he took care of it. We wanted cigarettes and he took care of it. Had an issue with our safe and he took care of it. Top notch.
30,Ok we all know you wait to check in. So I got in line early as I was told by an employee that standard check in was WAY worse. The wait for early check in was ridiculous 3 employees at reception and a substantial line with many rolling eyes. You pay extra for everything and it is spendy! Check in early check out late? Oh don‚Äôt forget the 52 bucks each day for the ‚Äúresort fee‚Äù. Wait! The pool area wait for a spot to lounge. Wait did I say it was a Thursday?
40,We stayed for 3 nights in April. We were in rooms 6453 and 6063 can't remember which tower this was but not too far from reception. We had a long queue for check in  but had read previous reviews so expected it!  The rooms were really nice though and spacious compared to what we had just stayed in at the Bellagio with a pool view. It was nice (and handy) to have a separate bath and shower so we could both get ready at once!  Overall we enjoyed our stay but do not recommend drinks at Cafe Americano - overpriced and you don't get the drink that's on the menu!
30,I felt the Caesar is a Vegas money grab. I know Vegas is like that but these guys are the pros. We got there an hour & a half before check-in and I knew right than I made a mistake when they asked for $55 plus tax $62 for early check-in. Let‚Äôs think about padding our pockets before accommodating the guests. It was all nickel and dime. No balconies just rooms even with the upgraded room. $75 to use the mini bar even if you want to keep your water cool. I wished they had staff wiping the machines. Just saying - nothing special here.
50,Treated family traveling from Philippines after 2 years of lockdown. They were impressed with the facility and how they feel privileged with how we are treated by the staffs most specially the housekeeping.  Thank you for keeping our room clean and complete with essentials
10,When you stay in at Cesar properties and are paying $52 a night resort fees you expect top of the line internet connection able to relax after a long day at work at the swimming pool. Well that's not going to happen!!!! Internet is very shotty alway down pool closes at 5:00 pm. When confronted staff resort fees does not cover pool access it's for Gym privileges that no one knows they have one. Airbnbs are the new way to go!!!! Never again!!!!!!
20,There was only two or three staff checking people into rooms. Our room was not cleaned on a daily basis as asked and when we asked where a local walk-in medical clinic was we were told to Google it. There is no one around to ask anything and trying to get a drink in the casino takes forever as there‚Äôs no staff. Very poor service and prices are ridiculous. You only get treated well if you are diamond or seven star; the rest of us don‚Äôt seem to matter.  We always stay at Caesars but our next vacation will be staying elsewhere
10,Arrived to room 3284 couch area smelled like vomit. Carpet was disgusting dirty. The restroom floor where toilet is was yellow. The chairs were meant to be ivory but were brownish dirty. Couch smelled like vomit carpet smelled like vomit. Caesar‚Äôs seriously clean it up! Such a disgusting experience and left. Encore was excellent!
10,Bathroom was filthy in our room light and faucets broken sewer smell in hallways on first floor that made many people gag and overpriced buffet out of many foods and a menu that didn‚Äôt add breakfast items for a.m. . We expected better from this place. It is supposed to be the crown jewel of the strip but has decayed in quality quite a bit. Save your money for other hotels that provide a better value
20,Room 5759. No wifi in room. Big problem as I was counting on being able to work from my room. Day 1: 40 minutes on the phone with their IT team. Failed. Day 2: Front desk said they would have Engineering look at it. Failed. Day 3. Richard from Facilities very helpful and patient. Got it working. Next morning. Failed again. Front desk manager offered me $50 credit for food/drinks which was USELESS for me on my company expense account; nothing for my personal inconvenience.    Otherwise the room was clean and comfortable. Staff was friendly
10,WiFi always disconnect no display of daily car fees. I paid $79 for four days they double charged for taxes they tried to up sell at check in and pay more for early check in $22 charged to my card for use of coffee pod. The list goes on
30,Check in - hectic included one surly valet and one very helpful valet. Everything costs extra now - valet parking pool etc. so what‚Äôs the resort fee ($50/day) buy me? Valet parking fee is $50/day - confusion if it‚Äôs charged on hotel bill or paid daily at valet services (we were told different answers by different staff). Having said all that we loved our suite and enjoyed the restaurants very much. Self check out kiosks worked well.
30,Once again they placed us in Julius tower without a view as a Diamond Plus member we should be in a better room inside the room is average you can't use the fridge because it's filled with their purchase junk if a family travelling where would they leave their kids food?
10,This hotel is awful. 1) there‚Äôs limited signage so frequently you have no idea where anything is. When you stop and ask staff members for directions they‚Äôre incredibly rude. 2) the furnishings in the actual rooms were old scuffed and dirty (including several questionable stains on the floor). 3) could not get my sink to stop running all night long. 4) they started construction at 7 f‚Äôing 30 in the morning - called the front desk to ask whether there was SUPPOSED to be drilling next door was told that this is a normal time to start construction. Yes I suppose it is but if you KNOW that for a fact WHY IN GOD‚ÄôS NAME WOULD YOU PUT YOUR CLIENTELE RIGHT NEXT DOOR?! Honestly stay somewhere else - your money will be better spent.
10,Very bad costumer service! When checking in had to do an almost 2 hours wait in the line lady at the front desk asked if I wanted daily housekeeping which I said YES! Well its been 3 days and no cleaning!!!! Ive called everyday for service and nothing happens!!! Never staying here again!!!
30,The room was amazing very comfortable and clean. Other than that it wasn't great.    First off the elevators to the parking garage are horrible at most I only saw that 2 of the 4 were working and even then they would never stop going down so you almost always had to take it up to go back down. On the last day only one elevator was working and it wouldn't stop on the 4th floor so you had to take it to 5 and walk down the ramp to get to the 4th floor.    Once you get into the hotel from the parking garage it is a long walk through the maze to get to the front desk... to wait in a long line.    Next the hotel elevator smelled like rotting eggs and it was smelling that way all 4 days.    Lastly the sink in our bathroom started gurgling up dirty water. They did come and fix that but then there were times when the hot water wouldn't dispense anything.    Not worth the price and wouldn't do it again.
20,We had a bad experience during our stay. On May 31 at night we were in bed in room 1612 and some bedbugs bit my wife for this reason she got scared and found the coffee on the mattress the cleaner reported it and the hotel took it as damage to the property so they charged us the entire mattress. We are requesting that the amount paid for this incident be credited to our credit card. The report is IN20220055574
30,You gambled and you still had to pay for your drinks at the bar ($18) unless you played like a maniac on the machine which left you no time to socialize. That was only the beginning but the one that threw it over the top was the room I stayed in had a coffee pot but not the coffee for free to use. They charged you $21 for a packet that has been provided for free in the past in all kinds of hotels in the past without ever paying That one was over the top!f and heart up You pay for parking regardless of having a room there and the hotel resort fee. Also when your on the machines not enough servers for the amount of people Lucky I had my own water as they hardly came by. The restaurant NOBU was good over priced but really good. I will be back for that but not to stay in the hotel. first and last. OH and anyone can get up to the rooms and there was a strange man lurking in the hallways looking for some girls.
10,Where should I start. This is one of the worst hotels on the strip. It states that this is a 5 star hotel but this hotel deserves less than 1 star.  We frequently visit Vegas atleast twice a year. We have stayed on many properties on strip and this time we decided to stay at Caesars.  Pros:  Property is located on strip    Cons:    - Long long long‚Ä¶ checkin lines. It took us 2.5 hours to checkin. This is how bad Caesars is. This happened even though we had filled pre checkin questionnaire before arriving  - Front desk lacks empathy they are slacking most of the time and are unapologetic.  - They will make sure to nickel and dime for every small thing.
10,Vegas local since ‚Äò87. The furniture in the room you could find nicer at a garage sale. Check in on a Saturday at 1pm wanted $55 for early check in. Told her will just check our bags and go to the pool. Who‚Äôs leaving Saturday? Then she says she‚Äôll waive it. Hallways base boards are destroyed. Missing wall pics with holes in it. Ceiling in elevators missing PCs. Pool server never brought our bill back and gave herself a nice tip too. Mr chow never again. Men can‚Äôt wear sandals but ladies can. Shove us in a corner in the bar where by the way it‚Äôs not a full menu. Suits walked up and asks is everting ok. Literally tell him NO. His response turns around and walks away. Nothing like spending $2k on Sting tickets and have a getaway like this. I‚Äôll never go back.
10,An incredibly negative experience. Checked into room the room was coated in dust the rug has nail clippings and junk (think a raisin). Had a supervisor come see the room and he agreed He agreed to get it clean immediately return 5 hours later to no avail. 5 calls to housekeeping to no avail. At 11:30PM walked down to the front desk to talk to a Manager. Room cleaned at midnight yet no rug vacuumed. Call this morning 4 times to talk to a manager placed on hold call disconnected. Connected back to reservations. Gave up on my way to the front desk. This is my first 24 hour experience. The main hallway from Octavius to the front lobby smells like a really bad toilet clearly something wrong with the plumbing somewhere. Net/net not clean quality of service a disaster and I paid more for a better room. Expensive and so many other options in Vegas.
20,Horrible checkin experience. I am Caesars platinum status and valet made it seem like they were doing me a favor to valet my car. Then spent 1.5 hours in Express Checkin. Machines did not work and there were only 2 employees helping people who had issues. Then they declined my caesars visa card which was working everywhere else. My family missed being able to spend time at the pool due to the horrible check in experience.
10,Arrived at 3. Wait online for at least 45mn. The room was not ready and they told me that I was supposed to received a text message telling me to come again to check in. Look at that. This is my last visit here
20,Elevators to rooms half didn‚Äôt work. Taxi pick up way to far away . Escalators around outdoors not working and very dangerous area at elevators leading away from hotel. Street people drugged out at escalator/elevator areas. Very dangerous.
20,Location is great. Check is a miserable experience. We arrived at 2pm and went to check in. About 60 people in line. They had a kiosk to check in tried that said we could check in but $50 to do so early. (most hotels let you into rooms if ready). We went and grabbed a bite and did online check in. Went back around 4pm and the line for regular checkin was double and the online kiosk line took about 30 min. Even thogh checked in online it didn't work and took about 40 min overall with support staff on the kiosks who barely communicated. They didn't look at or speak to you rather mumbled and pointed.    Got to room we had paid for a pool view but instead we were staring at a roof. We called down and they said nothing available right now you can come down and talk to a manager if you want. My husband did and they credited $60 total for the two nights there but not really the outcome we were looking for.    Our traveling companions didn't want the mini bar staring them in the face so they moved the items to a cupboard. The mini bar was on a sensor so if you touch it they charge you. I have seen this before but our friends had not and it DID NOT SAY it anywhere. They were charged for everything and we had to spend an hour in line at check out to resolve. They took the charges off but were like you should have known this is standard for Vegas strip (we haven't been to Vegas in 10 years).    Overall I am saying service is here is pretty much zero. We came to see Sting and the theatre here is great. The food options for restaurants are good (and very pricey but standard from what I could tell at other locations we encountered on the strip).    There are a lot of people here and the place has a lot going on making it seem pretty overwhelming. After walking around the Strip and looking at other check in lines Ceasars seemed like the worst. The Paris (owned by Ceasars) seemed way more managable at their check in location and overall vibe.    We plan to go back to Vegas and the Strip and the location was good so we will look for somewhere near Ceasars but I don't think we will stay there again so it is not a place I would recommend.
10,Check in and check out are horrible experiences! Staff is inadequate and system is just messed up.  If you don‚Äôt pay attention to details you‚Äôll end up paying for stuff you didn‚Äôt even buy!!  Also housekeeping started banging on our walls in the morning they were doing some sort of maintenance in the next room.  Very unprofessional.
10,Over an hour wait to check in at 1 am. 45 minute front desk wait Monday at 8 am. Only get two devices on WiFi at a time and yet I paid a $50+ resort fee per day. No room service after 10 pm. Won‚Äôt ever stay here again.
20,Cesar‚Äôs used to have the best reputation. Unfortunately the hype doesn‚Äôt live up to the current conditions. We stayed this past weekend for our anniversary and concert at their venue. The room was rough. Housekeeping does the best with what they‚Äôre given obviously but the rooms need more maintenance and work. Vents rattled rain shower head knob stuck in position so unable to turn chips and stains all over the room thick dust in vents . Just sad. Better places to spend the money.
30,Nice rooms and property and wonderful dining. But a few thins spoilt the overall quality of service.  1. Caesars palace will always minibar items to your room charge even if you dont even touch them. You have to check your bill and call them up to remove those items. Second time this has happened. Very Annoying.  2. Gym shuts at 5pm. What?  3. Taxi pick up line pushed to the street from outside the lobby. Why? outside the lobby was pretty wide open.  4. Check in meltdown. I did early check in; expected to simply pick up my keys on arrival (4:30pm). Unfortunately the kiosks were not working. Took another hour to figure out how to get the room keys. The front line folks were very helpful. But the back office seemed dysfunctional.
10,Everything was going well until we asked to check out a little later and I asked for 11:30 which is only half an hour late. I am pregnant and it takes me a bit time to get everything packed up. Usually they will accommodate us but the guest service over the phone told us that will be $80 for any minute after 11:00 am even 5 mins later. I was like okay. Later my husband called back to ask where can we drop the keys if we check out and need to get out of the garage. She gave him an attitude like he was an idiot. FYI: same person that picked up the phone earlier. This is Caesar Palace I expected better customer service. So disappointed!! We booked Bellagio and canceled because we heard good things at Caesar but I guess we will go back and stick with MGM resorts.
40,Shout out to - Pablo at the front desk was amazing at check in. We had four rooms and a lot of names for each room he was on it friendly and just a joy to start the weekend.Lara at the Pool was fantastic with helping us get a Cabana and was so nice. Evelyn at the active wear store by the Palace Tower was an absolute pleasure. She was helpful and delightful to deal with.    My only complaint was the cost of drinks at the pool are outrageous and that says a ton coming from me. It‚Äôs beyond ridiculous. 24 pk of beer $250. Mixed drinks averaged $30 a piece. Shame for this.
30,Corridors and elevators were literally smelling like vomit which no one bothered to fix. Ripped bed sheets hair all over the sofa in my room. Loud music coming in from outside note I was on 22nd floor but still. You get the idea. Extremely overpriced restaurants with average quality food and they do not offer even free water in the room. Water bottle is sold like at $7. I feel better value would be Bellagio overlooking fountains.
10,Credit card charged nearly ¬£500 after we had checked out.    We did not use the mini bar or damage the room 2030 that we stayed in.    We have tried numerous times to obtain an itemised bill / invoice for our stay.    After several attempts we still have not received any response very disappointed.    REF: NORX48 Ferguson Room 2030
30,Caesar's Palace used to be a fabulous luxurious place to stay in Vegas. We went recently to attend the Sting concert. While the concert was incredible unfortunately our stay at Caesar's was not so great. They have zero customer service and force you to use a robot/app if you want anything. Their rewards program is difficult to use ...and even if you upgrade a room they nickel and dime you for everything. No robes no nice toiletries no coffee for the coffee maker. Oh and make sure and check your bill when you leave because they charged us for mini bar purchases every night we were there...but we never touched it. Our shower wouldn't drain well that last two nights we were there. Our phone didn't work and one light on the wall didn't work. Internet was terrible. What a shame... as we used to love this place! One saving grace was the swim up bar/blackjack table at the pool. The dealers were super fun and we enjoyed that quite a bit. But won't be staying here again... Bellagio would be a better choice.
40,Estephanie took care of my requests and was very polite. Had requested for a rollaway bed the night before but didn‚Äôt show up went back to check on the status and she was able to resolve promptly will come back again
30,My husband and I came out to Caesars for a quick anniversary trip. We hadn‚Äôt been to Vegas in 10 years and decided to try Caesars and it was our first trip in this post-pandemic phase. Overall we thought the experience was just ok.    The good: The front desk agent was really nice and upsold us on an upgrade to a mini suite in the newly renovated Palace Tower. It was really nice and we were happy with the upgrade.    The bad:  - Pool: the whole pool experience left something to be desired. The water was ridiculously cold and pool service was totally lacking for this type of property. If you wanted a drink you had to wave down the server. They didn‚Äôt come around and check if you‚Äôre ok or wanted anything. And then they would only take one order at a time. They also didn‚Äôt really have a pool food menu but you can order for delivery from the app although they don‚Äôt make this obvious anywhere. The pools are also stating to look pretty dated and need an upgrade. And there is hardly any shade anywhere which is hard to handle in 100+ degree weather.  - Expensive: I know things cost more when you travel and especially these days but some of these prices were ridiculous. First there is no complimentary coffee in the room. You can get a coffee kit from the mini bar for like $12 for 4 pods of coffee. Come on at least offer some complimentary coffee! And don‚Äôt get me started on the mini bar prices. $18 for a sleeve of Oreos?  - Food: I‚Äôd say the food options on the property are average. They have some big name chefs and we tried the steakhouse which was good but not mind blowing. The best casual option was Bobby‚Äôs Burgers for a quick bite.    All in all I‚Äôm not sure we would stay here again.
30,Much to expensive for food. Not enough choices in the food court. My favorite was closed down. Plus they charged me for the mini bar which I never used. Machines were messy most of the time and drink service was poor. We would sit for hours without anyone coming by.
20,We stopped by here for dinner. Where are all of the restaurants that used to be here? I can get an over priced burger anywhere.  The place is very difficult to navigate.  To top it off the place reeks of mold mildew and cannabis.    The one positive is the addition TrueFood.
10,No room service. Some odd link to order food. Cab line at least a 5 iron or a couple hundred yards walk in the heat. Basic amenities store closed the whole time we were there. Sting was great but we can stay at the Super 8 and have better amenities. We travel the world and once had Diamond status here before Covid. Tried it since bad experience but came back because of some of the staff we got to know over the years. They said don‚Äôt come back it‚Äôs not getting better anytime soon. The Cosmo or the Wynn are both way better choices for seasoned travelers.
30,We arrived to Caesars palace for check in and found ourselves in a line which took over an hour. When we finally reached the top of the queue the actual check in process took forever. I checked into 8+ other hotels on my travels across Arizona/Nevada/California and none of them took over a few minutes to check in. I understand the enormity of the hotel but this should be able to be done pre-arrival so it is a matter of ID key go.    What saved our mood was that we were informed our room was overbooked and we were to be upgraded. We discovered ourselves in a deluxe suite which was an incredible experience. The suite itself had no coffee or tea facilities..if I had paid the actual price for our upgraded room I would not be happy with that. It‚Äôs the bare minimum- even hostels offer free Tea/Coffee facilities. But we forgave due to our amazing suite!    The casino was fun but getting served drinks was one in a million. We got served twice in 2 hours having finished our drinks half an hour each time. Bars/Restaurants were extortionate so we ate on the strip. The one bar we did visit gave us a disappointing experience and we left shortly with our way-too-expensive-for-bad-service drinks in hand.    I wouldn‚Äôt stay here again however it was an interesting one and done experience.
50,While the wait in the Diamond line was longer than usual due to some demanding guest requests Eric was patient and friendly. It made a great first impression for what was a very relaxing stay. YeahEric.
20,Caesars goes out to every length to nickel and dime their guests. Firstly we requested early check in. The front desk had told us that we would receive a text when our room was ready which we never received. We checked in at 4 o‚Äôclock which is the normal time yet we‚Äôre informed that we would still have to pay the early check-in fee. It took quite a few calls and a trip back to the front desk to finally get the charge credited. Once in the room you will find that you cannot use the mini fridge unless you want to pay the $75 fee. There is a Keurig machine however there is no pods unless you want to pay the $14 for the one pod which is in the mini bar. The bed was very comfy however the room in general could‚Äôve been a little cleaner and we did kill one roach in the bathroom.    Our next trip to Vegas will be booked in a hotel that is not part of the Caesars entertainment group.
10,"The day before our arrival I received a few texts from ""Ivy"" their virtual concierge. I upgraded our room to a ""pool view"" with the add-on of in coffee maker. Well our direct view was the building next to ours and pool(s) were visible at a 90 degree angle. The coffee maker required an in room purchase of the coffee pods.  We pair $52.10 ""resort fee"" but were discouraged from using the pool unless we rented lounge chairs or a cabana ($400+ per day). Oh yea ""don't take room towels to the pool area""!  On a four day stay we asked for early (9:30 am) housekeeping one morning and when we returned to our room at 3:50 pm - no one from housekeeping touched our room. When I complained they said they'd send up some ""amenities"" (dictionary definition; a desirable or extraordinary additional service or item) after pushing what the meant and they replied ""soap shampoo and towels""! Not what I'd call an ""amenity"" - service items but hardly an ""amenity"" especially at over $400 per day.  No ventilation in the bathroom.  I suggest bypass this once premier property and check-in to anywhere else."
30,It's not surprising that Caesar's Palace does the same things as every other casino to keep you at the machines spending money. But even if you leave to enjoy your room the predatory practices don't stop. You are charged additional costs (on top of an already expensive hotel room) for check in before 4pm using the refrigerator in your room (even if you are only storing personal items) and you are charged if you interact with the mini bar. Note that doesn't say if you use the items from the mini bar as you are apparently charged if you even pick them up to inspect them. Furthermore the bar is placed precariously close to the edge of the furniture so if you need support while you move around the room you could accidentally knock them over and have to pay for it. The charge amounts are so outrageous I can't see them ever being a valid choice; for example 75$ to store food in the refrigerator is probably more expensive than the cost of the food being stored.
10,They downgraded our room due to them overbooking promised $100.00 credit and a room change on 2nd day. Never got the credit $100.00. Then the bill had charges for mini bar foods that we never used. Also a movie charge for $27.00 we never watched. There is no price list for the mini bar and their scan bar never worked so your stuck with the ridiculous prices. Both rooms the pricing scan did not work. I'm sure All the rooms were that way. Thier prices were Crazy $81.00 for basic mass-produced horrible breakfast for two with 1 milk 1 juice. Beer cost $25.00 for a Budweiser. Two drinks in lobby bar was over $66.00. These rates are out of control. THIS PROPERTY IS SO OVER PRICED! We feel totally ripped off! I suggest you not stay here. Trying to reach someone regarding our bill has been impossible so far but I will not give up. They have ripped me off enough already. We will continue back to our other choices. Sorry we checked this one out. Big Mistake. AVOID!
30,So my family and I booked a one night stay at Caesar‚Äôs palace and we‚Äôre very hopeful. At check-in they asked if I‚Äôd like to upgrade for $60.00 and I said yes. We go to the room which has an exclusive view of the A/C units. The upgraded portion of room was the jacuzzi tub and upon inspection of the tub we found Pubic hair dirt and a burn mark. The room also had food crumbs and splinter molding.  We decided this is not worth the upgrade and went to see if they could change our room back. Instead they said housekeeping was on their way to clean the room and they provided a voucher for food and drinks.  We went back to the room and waited for a few hours before heading to the forum and walking around. We managed to get stuck in the elevator and had to pried the doors open.  We headed back to the room and found housekeeping had indeed been in the room. The only difference was the hand towels were folded and soap had been replaced but the tub remained the same.  We were exhausted from traveling and opted to not use the upgraded tub after all.  The following day we went to the pool which said it opened at 10am. We got to the pool at 9:40 to find all the chairs were taken with people setting their stuff on it. We were able to go to a different pool and enjoyed our time there.  Overall we were very much underwhelmed of the experience and disappointed. We had a much more enjoyable experience at the Venetian and resorts world.  Paying for parking also sucked!!!
20,What an incredible dump. Stay away!!! Rooms are old beat up and flithy.  Nothing is open. No buffett. Jack hammer in the lobby midday - I kid you NOT!  Forum Tower - one out of six elevators works - 10 minutes of waiting in elevator lobby to get down from and up to your room. Unbelievable!
50,This past weekend my wife and I along with 2 of our closes friends went to Vegas and like I always do we stayed at Caesar's Palace.  I just want thank everyone at Caesar's Thank you.  My wife and her friend loved the spa and salon and the service was great.  From time we arrived till the time we left staff was always there with a helping hand.  I say a special thanks to our host Roberto Ahedo. Roberto always goes that extra mile to make sure our stay at Caesars is perfect. Looking forward to our next trip to Vegas and Staying at Caesars Palace.
30,I have been to Vegas every year until Covid hit. I always stayed at Caesars due to it's central location and I always had good experience. This time was different. Self Check In was chaotic. Many people not knowing what to do. The room was nice and clean. I was in Julius Tower which was easy access to and from the casino. The most disappointing part of the experience was the Casino. Most of the table games are gone and for those that they did have the limits were mostly $50-$100. Obviously Caesar's does not want the gambler willing to spend $4000-$5000 over several days. I was forced to play at other properties owned by Caesar's. When I return I will not be staying at Caesar's. There are other places with much nicer accommodations if you are not going to be able to gamble where you stay. Casino had a lot of construction going on and it appears that they do not have enough employees.
50,We went to Vegas for my husbands 40th Birthday. We stayed at a reputable well known hotel which was very local for the first 2 days and then onto Caesar‚Äôs for the remainder of our trip. Caesar‚Äôs absolutely blew us away and a million times better than the previous hotel. Caesars is a beautiful hotel fantastic location great food (although expensive you have to try the buffet) great casinos great pools wonderful attached/on premise shops and restaurants great ambiance stunning and clean architecture/features. At certain times in the mall they had the Atlantis show which was fantastic! The staff at Caesar‚Äôs were helpful and courteous. We didn‚Äôt want to leave and highly recommend this hotel!! IMO this hotel was more classier and better than the first hotel we stayed in before and wished we had booked all our nights at Caesars.    The only negative Is that it can get VERY busy in the foyer/walk through area (towards the elevators) which isn‚Äôt good when you‚Äôre carrying a heavy bag/suitcase to check in/out! Just a warning that some people (mostly young American women) think that area is their personal catwalk and despite seeing you carrying/pulling suitcase/bags will get offended and sarcastically comment/blame you if your bag accidentally rubs against them! This happened to my husband and I upon check in and out. So be prepared to navigate and fight your way through the crowds. We didn‚Äôt have these issues when we weren‚Äôt carrying bags but there is still a lot of foot traffic. I hope hotel management can cordon off/create a section for guests arriving/checking out in those areas to prevent conflicts in the future.    Other than the foot traffic incidents the hotel is fantastic and my number 1 choice hotel. Highly recommend
50,We booked a one night stay originally in the Forum Tower. We arrived relatively late in the evening (after 11PM) and there was a very long line to check-in. The self-check-in kiosks were down but I expected a bit of a weight given the day of check-in (Thursday) and the fact that Sting was performing at Caesar's that weekend. The staff member (Xavier) who checked us in was very friendly and gave us an upgrade to a suite in the Augustus tower even though we didn't mention anything about the check-in wait. The room was wonderful: clean and comfortable. They even gave us a complimentary late check-out at 12PM. Would have liked to have stayed longer to enjoy the room and all that the Caesars resort grounds has to offer. During our stay we enjoyed a delicious dinner at Amalfi (highly recommended!). Overall we were very impressed with everything about this resort and will definitely be staying here again.
30,The room was adequate with a very nice bathroom. Unfortunately it was not cleaned and we had to find someone to clean and replace the towels. As usual there was no fridge but an extortionately priced mini-bar. There was a coffee machine but coffee was not provided so a complete waste of time. The resort fee is far too expensive for the facilities provided. Wi-fi was poor and we had to continually re-connect. The hotel itself is certainly not disability friendly. In order to leave the hotel there were 2 sets of steps which neither myself nor my husband could use. The wheelchair lift at the side did not work and despite calling for assistance was not in use for the whole of our stay. As a result we had an extremely long walk with no directions. I would certainly not stay here again nor recommend it.
20,"I have visited Caesars 15 time i the last 10 years. My visit 6/10/22 - 6/13/22 was a very negative visit.  to start there was 3 car in front of us in Valet and it took the guy 30 min to get us the ticket. Bellboys took the luggage and gave us a ticket. When we got to check in the line was around 10 people and it took 45 min to check in we asked for 3 King room over looking the pool on the original Resv and I called the morning of. They had 3 king room on 3 different floors and ask the have on the same floor please and the lady made a big deal and took another 20 min to get it done.  There is only 1 place to get the reward card (because i lost mine) and the line was 30 min. Had to have it or they would charge ""50.00"" for parking.  Great food at the Sat brunch.  Overall what we (6 people) saw and feel is ALL the employee did not want to be there NEVER a hello good morning or any greeting. The management needs to reorganize the employees.  NOT LIKE THE OLD DAYS at caesars. They are the biggest and the think the pants are too big."
50,Thank you Salvador at the front desk at Caesar‚Äôs Palace last week June 2 ‚Äì 7 2022 during our stay of 5 nights! Thank you for your first class service and particularly your help in our crisis when we could not get into our Palace King Room minutes before attending our 7 pm Cirque du Soleil show!    We wish to commend the awesome 5 star service we received from Salvador on our check-in and throughout our stay. Salvador was sincerely happy to meet us with a huge friendly smile and happy attitude. He took time to suggest reasonable upgrade to our room (which we did) and he is incredibly efficient and full of energy. In a crazy place like Caesar‚Äôs Palace is was so great to have professional experienced high level hospitality from Salvadore and we truly appreciate his role in making our sisters 5 day stay a really good time!    Susan & Jill Moore  British Columbia Canada
50,The room was great. Very clean comfortable and enjoyable. Checkin was longer than we would‚Äôve liked but I understand it was busy. The staff was pleasant and assisted us to our rooms. Overall it was excellent.
30,The price increases on everything since November 2019 are ridiculous. It would appear that they are trying to recover lost revenue by gouging their guests. Vegas has been expensive but high prices & mediocre service will drive people away. The front desk staff was very friendly & we liked the location. Probably wouldn‚Äôt stay there again.
10,Avoid this hotel at all costs! What a joke! We arrived at 10:45 am and tried checking in but they wanted an extra 60.00 for early check in. We decided to spend 350.00 and rented a cabana to wait at the pool until 4:00pm  when they told us to come back. We had a 5:00 dinner reservation and a show at 7:00 pm. We showed up at 4:15 and was told room is not ready yet. Now we dont even have time to shower and get ready for dinner. Its almost 5:00 and no room yet! What a joke!. I will update as evening progresses.  UPDATE:  We ended up going to dinner reservation still wearing swim trunks and flip flops. We had gone to bell desk to retrieve our luggage anticipating our room being ready at 4:00 so we also had to bring luggage to dinner! By the time we finished an excellent dinner at Water Grill it was 6:45 and we barely had enough time to shower and make it to a Sting concert. Somebody in Bell service broke open my TSA lock and opened my luggage. My wife's bag had been opened as well. We didnt find anything missing. Management at front desk didnt really seem to want to do much to comp us and keep our future business other than omit a 50.00 resort fee charge. We will not be going back.
30,Carpets need replacing. Very dirty. Housekeeping should deep clean rooms periodically - checking corners is key. For the money you are attempting to recoup from Covid at least keep service on par. Restaurants were closing at 830 (kitchens) although we had 830 rezzies. If I am paying top dollar I don‚Äôt want cut rate amenities. Paid for a day bed with torn fabric and stuffing coming out. Pools were dirty. Not nearly enough cocktail staff at pools again for $1000 spend in 4 hours at the pool better service is warranted. Just did not feel like a Caesar.
30,Nice hotel but will never stay there again. When we tried to check in at the 4 pm check-in time we were told that our room was not ready. HOWEVER magically the upgraded rooms WERE ready if we wanted to spend an extra $69. Others were told the same thing. Just another way for the hotel to make more money.
10,We were in Vegas for a conference and stayed at the Wynn which was gorgeous and the guest rooms were clean and beautiful! We had one extra night in Vegas but the Wynn was already full so we transferred to Caesars. After waiting in line for an hour to check in and we paid extra to check in early the front desk woman who helped us was less than pleasant. We go to our room and It smelled terrible a very strange and strong disinfect smell. We requested a new room which wasn‚Äôt any better. Furniture was beat up dust everywhere mold in shower shower head broken bathtub surround was broken bathroom walls had something smeared on them. Casino floor was so crowded it wasn‚Äôt even fun. We will never stay at the hotel/casino again. It was such a disappointment and just gross.
30,Nothing is courtesy here. No water no coffee and even many aspects of the pool. Take K cups with you. They don‚Äôt allow Uber to go to front causing you to walk a long ways in the heat. They aren‚Äôt user friendly for first time guests. Navigation from Uber drop to check in is crazy if you are unfamiliar. Nothing is explained. You have to get all the disappointments on your own.
20,The room I had was old and dated. The trim in the bathroom was coming off around the edges and the couch in the room was all stained and soiled. Not a place I would stay again. Some upkeep would go a long way!
20,The owners of these property‚Äôs have become very greedy they nickel and dime you for everything they don‚Äôt even have a fridge you can use in room they try to charge you for early check in on room already clean. Prices are stupid high Vegas used to be a trip that wasn‚Äôt crazy expensive not that way now will never go back
10,This hotel is clearly living off a past reputation from our corridor we could see majority of rooms/corridors had not been updated in many years. See photos of our room. Despite asking twice to move rooms they were unable to accommodate this. The furniture was dated and chipped dust built up throughout mirrors cracked things falling apart.  The lobby restaurants and shopping centre were incredible and pool area was nice however during our 3 nights stay every day half of the pools were shut.  On one occasion the largest pool was reserved unless you paid several hundred dollars for a sun lounger even though we had been in the same pool the day previous day this meant many people crammed into smaller pools where there was only a small handful in the larger pool.  When checking in (mid week not peak summer) we waited an hour to be seen the staff were working very hard however for such a large reputable hotel you‚Äôd think they would have more staff.  There‚Äôs no complimentary water or hot drinks in the room- the coffee is upwards of $20.  Would not recommend.
50,Yup...they don't provide a 50 c K cup to their guests. They charge them $20 for two if them. So that sets the stage of over priced poor service in a crappy hotel pretending to by luxury. If you've stayed in a true luxury hotel you'd never get away with the smell the dirt the worn furniture the lackadaisical service and the rude management when you ask them to address it. I'll never stay  in a Caesars property ever again and if forced to by corporate for an event I will personally inspect the offered room first. Disappointed to say the least.
50,Nice spacious room with modern decor. Love the bathroom with the oversized jet tub and separate spacious shower. Also loved the private toilet. Beds were extremely comfortable and facilitated a great nights sleep.    The hotel is certainly large enough to accommodate large crowds and conventioneers. Elevators were never overcrowded because they are plentiful. Love the architecture and sites throughout the hotel. Definitely a place where one really doesn‚Äôt have to step foot outdoors because there is food shopping gambling entertainment etc. all under one roof. If you must go outside you are conveniently located near several sites that are within walking distance.    My first stay in Caesar‚Äôs Palace and I would most certainly return.
40,I would go back to Caesars after my recent stay. I was in the Palace Tower. It is a hike to get to the exit to the strip. I did tire of bumping shoulders with and weaving thru people on the casino floor by the end of the week. I have to say that my experience wasn't disappointing like recent reviews indicated. However my self and my colleague both experienced high mini bar charges on our bill for items that we absolutely did not touch in our rooms. That seems to be a bit of a scam. I called and with little trouble got the charges removed from my bill. There was a long line at check in but a staffer came and got our entire row of people waiting in line and walked us over to VIP check in where there were no lines and 3 staffers waiting to assist us. That was wonderful. My room was clean and comfortable. I did receive daily room service after requesting it at check in. Seems foolish to have a coffee pot in the room but no coffee. It must be purchased for a million dollars off of the mini bar. CVS and Walgreens are close by on the strip. I purchased some pods there. We enjoyed the pool area. Ample chairs and pools available to abate the crowd. The towels are large clean and plentiful. Pool days were good days. The Palace Tower elevator opened right at the pool entrance. That was convenient. One area that we did not enjoy was the taxi pick up. It was like Where's Waldo. The first day it was a LONG hot walk across the entrance area to a cab pick up area. The second day it was right outside the front door (found out after we started walking across the driveway) and the next day it was out front again. The day we left with piles of luggage of course it was the long hot hike across the lot. I would return to Caesars. Not exactly the customer service that I expected from such an iconic label but maybe that is post-covid travel now. Brands have figured out that they can offer less and still charge significant rates.
20,This was our 7th stay at Caesars and after not being able to come because of Covid we were very excited. After a long flight from England we came to check in to be told if we wanted a decent room we would have to pay a further $700! We went to our room which was absolutely awful! The hotel refused to upgrade us to a decent room - we were staying for 7 nights! We ended up paying $400 to update to a room in a better tower. The general attitude of the staff was underwhelming to say the least. Our room didn‚Äôt get cleaned etc everyday! Which meant having to use towels from the day before that were still wet!  The next day we got up and went to go and sit by the pool when it opened at 9am‚Ä¶there was a queue of around 100 people waiting to go to the pool - we waited our turn and had to quickly grab two beds before they all went - the pool was more crowded than we had ever experienced before! This was the same every day of our stay. During our stay One of the pools was drained which meant everyone descended on the main pool - people were struggling for beds and ended up sitting on their towels on the floor!  The whole vibe was different - even the smell they pump in had vanished.  The cost of beers by the pool were $14 for one carina can! And $13 for a sprite! Shocking! Just didn‚Äôt enjoy this visit after having to wait since 2019!
50,If you see Eric at the 7 Star check in desk you will find an extremely helpful knowledgeable and patient person. His local knowledge helped us maximize our enjoyment in LV. It‚Äôs always a pleasure to find someone who understands the frustration of traveling and takes the extra step to welcome you to town. Thank you Eric you are a valuable member of the Caesars team. Gary
20,Friends and I booked Caesars Palace to stay in for our 40th birthday treat in Las Vegas. Arrived late evening check in was very quick and simple and after realising a room I initially booked was a lot further away from my friends rooms the lady at reception was able to book me into the same tower at an upgraded price which was helpful. The room was big and had a great view of the pools. Initial thought was that it looked clean but clearly needed some TLC. The beds headboard had scratches across it wood was chipped on various pieces of furniture and the bathroom needed some cork in areas but was relatively happy. The next day a lady arrived to check mini bar which I had not touched but commented that there were missing items. I reiterated that I had not taken anything especially at the prices! I also dared not open fridge after being told if even used it for personal item there would be a charge of $75. When she opened fridge there was pots of  left over chinese stored clearly from previous guest and clearly showed thay the room was not properly checked/cleaned before I checked in.  I realised after the first day that I had to press the button next to door for my room to be made up however the rest of my time there I did press this so my room could be made up but they never did not once. Yet the mini bar items were changed so someone did enter the room!  There was a large Jacuzzi bath which I looked forward to using. Once filled I got in and turned jets on ans relaxed. However not long agter I started rhe jets green foam and green bits appeared across rhe water. Naturally I jumped out and showered. Absolutely disgusting.  So for the price I paid for each night over ¬£200 a night I felt that it wad not worth anyway near that and was very disappointed. The casino area was ok ans thw shopping areas was very nice. Restaurant we used for breakfast called Cafe Americano waa ok but overly cooked the poached eggs with my egg benedict breakfast more like boiled egg the qay the yolk was. I asked for better which was replaced easily enough however it was only very slightly better and was still over cooked. If a chef can't produce a decent poached egg bit of a worry.  I am coming back to Las Vegas but will never return to this hotel.
20,We were checked in a dirty room with dirty beddings we went back front desk and was changed to another one was just ok. Grace the cashier gave us a voucher that we couldn‚Äôt use $50 . Charged for fridge
30,We did not get the room we thought we had booked. Ended up paying $300 more per night for a regular double queen room with 2 toilets than we would have for a regular room with one bathroom. The rooms were okay nothing special but relatively clean. The shower could use some re-caulking. If you bring leftovers back to your room from a meal you can't keep the food in the fridge in the room unless you want tot be charged $75. There is no information in the rooms that tell you where things are in the casino.  However Gemma the second person we spoke to at Check-In was super helpful and a standout during our trip. As a birthday celebration trip Caesar's didn't live up to our expectations. As it is we probably won't be staying at Caesar's again.
20,"Recently stayed for 4 nights and had 2 rooms.    We have made Caesars our go to place in Vegas over the last few years - always loved the location the architecture the access to the forum shops and food options.    First off I'm not a big gambler so perhaps if you are a big player maybe you will have a better experience.    Checking in after a long travel day was outrageously frustrating as our Uber driver drops us off at their designated spot so that we can carry our luggage through the casino without much help from the inadequate signage.    We finally get to the check in line and spend an hour and a half waiting to check into our rooms.    It's obvious at this point Caesars has changed dramatically from my previous visit a couple years ago. Frankly they do not have near enough employees working the from desk to check you in - not blaming those folks as I'm sure they are stressed out from the long lines as well.    As others have said the check in process is a microcosm of the overall lack of service you receive from this hotel at nearly every turn.    You want room service? Ha! Good luck go online and order something instead of actually talking with a live person. Want to use the Keurig coffee machine in your room? Good luck better bring your coffee pods (I went to the CVS and bought some) because they do not deliver pods to the room - the texting automation told me that was because of covid - LOL - covid doesn't stop them from stocking the outrageously expensive items in the mini bar.    Want to go buy a cup of coffee in the morning? Get ready to stand in line for 20 minutes and no refills.    How about a drink as you lounge by the pool? $30 for a Pina Colada    I stay in nice places and understand things are expensive - but don't gouge me for basic stuff!    Then I find out about the $52 a day per room ""resort fee"" are you kidding me! What a joke just charge more for the room instead of pulling this out - 'All the resorts do it"" was the customer service reply I got after calling to inquire about the charges on my bill. Of course that is after I had to go online to inquire about the charges because of course God forbid you can actually talk to a live person and get service.    Talking to one of the bartenders he lamented the status of service in the hotel and the complaints he receives from the patrons - big players and non players alike - and points to the new ownership who have cut employees accords the board.    I will never stay there again - thanks for the memories."
10,Rooms and price were excellent till you added in the $52 resort fee and room tax.  No actual room service must order from outside venders. Only avail were tacos hamburgers and pizza. The Americsno Cafe food was excellent. price was $$$. Bar 2 - double gin & tonic $63. hard to get a drink or eat shortage of staff.  Parking is way out back. No valet unless you are a 7 diamond member. Non-member guest park 1/4 mile in the back garage.  In five days the front desk check in was 40 to 60+ minute wait.  Always long line to check in. We not be returning ever.
50,Julie was so helpful to us in our stay at Caesars Palace Las Vegas. The first night she got us into a room much closer to are exit for the bus transportation for our events for the State Farm Convention. She handled the request and everything we needed very professionally and nicely. She was a true Gem. Then when we got a call that our credit card was not in the system she got into our records and got it taken care of for us very efficiently and was very nice and professional about everything once again. She is an excellent employee for this Hotel and is such a pleasure to work with.
10,I think Caesars Palace much have the most unfriendly unhelpful staff of any establishment I have ever visited and I understand it‚Äôs just had a massive refurbishmentI have to ask the questionwhere?!  The food court serves over priced food and drink with the atmosphere of a school canteen.
30,Stayed 2 nights in the Octavis tower and the room was beautiful! But the hotel size makes things complicated. Uber pickup was far away making it complicated to get quick transportation. Hotel taxi area people accepting small payments from private cars for transportation recommendations. Cafe restaurant was very nice with tasty food and great service. All black jack table minimums $25. I was surprised on my bill with an early checkin charge of $55 (1 pm checkin vs 4 pm expected) So it's a beautiful hotel to impress but it's complicated in many aspects. Personally I will choose another hotel next time.
10,"Second time staying here in 8 months. The front desk is not helpful they couldn't check me in early and call me when my room was ready. Paid for early check-in  but i didn't get in the room until 1:45. When i came in there was a noticeable debris on the floor which included dental floss "" Grouse"" seem like the carpet wasn't completely vacuumed. Then i pulled back the sheets and there was a blood stain on the bottom sheet near the pillow are . i had to call and have sheets delivered and changed them my self. even the mattress pad had blood on it. i had to pull all the sheets off and asked if my room could be cleaned by 3:00 i was told they didn't know. i asked for some type of compensation i was also told no. We like staying here due to the concerts at the coliseum guess we will have to rethink the matter. Our House keeper Rosa was excellent and said she would handle the situation and did. Front Desk is Terrible rude and non accommodating"
40,Arrived as a party of 8 booked on a package through BA - confirmation of 2 x palace premium rooms on booking - on arrival we were told we only had 1 room! We had to wait around an hour for them to sort and were then told we were in Octavia rooms - I advised we had upgrades to palace premium - they said they were fully booked so had to have Octavia rooms - rooms were quite dated - 2 out of 7 days the rooms were not cleaned or towels changed (we had to go ask for towels) not what I would expect from 5* hotel
30,Ridiculous amt of waiting to check in waisted our afternoon in line then having to keep coming back several to see the readiness of our rooms fees galore for everything early check ins beforr 4 pm rediculouss resort fees for room fridge soo over ratedthe buffets the most disappointed at the carving station very upsetting server with bad attitude unwilling to allow to select choices was rude blunt to multiple peopleruined our experience. After charging such high fees to eat there should be top service and selection. Never encountered this before.
20,I stayed at Caesars Palace from 30 May 2022 thru June 2 2022. My wife and I were looking forward to the stay. Years ago we spent time there and enjoyed ourselves in a great room with reasonable prices. All of that is gone. The rooms are outdated with chipped baseboards walls and furniture. After our first day there they closed the main pool and drained it. We were able to use one of the other pools so not a total loss. Aside from the price of the hotel room you have the pleasure of paying $52.10 per day resort fee. For what the pleasure of paying $12.00 per beer and even more for a cocktail. I will not be going back to Caesars there are too many nice hotels to stay at better shape for less money. I will be booking my next Vegas trip scheduled in September at the Wynn resort. Friends stayed at Wynn last month and couldn‚Äôt say enough good things about it. Pretty dissatisfied with Caesars!
30,The place is lovely. But the room we paid extra for had its challenges. The wood work was banged up in the bath as was the toilet seat which we had to sit on to one side. The head board was all scraped up looking like a cat got there first. The first restaurant we went in was very over priced. For a cheese burger and these small tacos no bigger than a half dollar to cost $64 was on eye opener.
20,I intended to entertain friends and I wanted to treat myself so I sprung for a Julius Luxury Suite on the Signature level.    I was flying in from Seoul South Korea but unfortuately my connection was delayed four hours due to high winds. I tried to check in via the app as I wanted to avoid the long check in line. When I tried to check in on the app it told me I could not check via the app but need to checkin in person.    I called the hotel and they told me not to worry I could check at the kiosk. When I arrived the kiosks we down so I had to wait in the line with the rest of the plebes. Despite the long trip from Seoul and delays I was able to stay up right while I waited 40 minutes in line.    I was met by a surly woman who clearly did not want to hear my complaint how dare a plebe paying more than $2k for their stay complain. I asked why I could not check in with the app and she told me that suites are not allowed to use the app but must checkin in person. So I payed more to get worse treatment.    Despite paying more than $2k for a four nights I was asked if I wanted maid service. Huh? She told me if I wanted my room clean I would need to call and request it. To reward my complain she gave a suite at the end of 1/2 mile hallway with a view overlooking the parking lot.    I asked if the mini bar could be removed see said if I want to put personal items in the refrigerator it is $75 a day! Basically you are not a customer but a plebe. I asked if I would be charged for excessive toilet paper useage she did not respond.    The suite was beautiful and in good condition.    I was jet lagged and woke up at 4:00. I thought no problem as I am in LV I will get an american style breakfast. I went to Ceasers 24 cafe and guess what it was closed despite the open 24 hours sign. I was informed they would open at 5:00. I caem back at 5:00 but the were not service the breakfast menu but the late night menu.    I was expecting guest so at 11:30 I requested my room be made up by 5:00. I did this via their texting concierge which is hanndy. The text I recieved back was it may or may not happen by 5:00. WTF?! I called and text multiple times to make sure that it was done before my guest arrived.    This was repeated the next day.
20,The check in process took an hour. Huge wait & lines. The room has no refrigerator for guest use. It is stocked with drinks for purchase only. No microwave. There is a Kuerig to make coffee but they didn‚Äôt leave pods. Luckily we brought our own. The rug is separating from the seam to go into the bathroom. The phone only worked on the speaker. The shower had two shower heads that was stuck so you couldn‚Äôt only use one. The air conditioner worked and the drapes closed automatically. Also the bed was comfortable.
30,I don't know what the problem is perhaps it's hard to find help. More than half the restaurants in the food court were closed. A few of the main dine-in restaurants were not open either. Poker tournament director was obviously new and had no experience. The dealers had to tell him what to do. It's still Caesars but there are now early and late check-in charges dining options reduced and less perks. Having said all that the servers and staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. There are too many options on the strip. I will be staying elsewhere on my next trip.
20,"Left an expensive sport blazer hanging in the closet of my room 467...There for business convention 3 nights. Left Friday Morning - Went back Saturday morning to check lost and found. Well - still checking a month later. Hotel verified someone did book the room and check in the same afternoon I checked out so Housekeeping ""had"" to clean and sanitize the room before the next guest arrives. The process of lost and found is simple...They take the item and out the room number on it. Not rocket science. Only explanation is that someone did not clean the closet or someone stole the jacket. I want to be reimbursed and all they say submit another form. Plus there was a closed jar of Marijuana found behind the bed when I arrived. smh."
20,There was a large hair all in our shower when we checked in. Gross!! They offered to send housekeeping up but I had already taken care of it. We checked in With 4 adults and had linens for three. Probably would stay somewhere house next time #####
10,Poor rating did not like the check in procedure it was too lengthy it took too long very few staff for so many check ins staff behviour was bad and also facility in room like hit water ketley was not provided v bad
50,Everything was great. We go twice a year for the last 22 years except during Covid. I feel the Resort Fees are getting way to high. Very clean great service. Have the best beds in town from other places I have stated at. Great Poker Room. Wife loves the mall and Cheesecake Factory.
20,Shower wasn‚Äôt working when we got in the room. Called them to fix it and took them 3 hours to come. When they came we were sleeping (it was 1:30am) and they just walked in the room and woke us up.    In the morning shower and sink stopped working again (there was no water). Asked them to come and help again and allow us a later checkout but they were very intimidating when we said that‚Ä¶    Apart from that the location is good but can‚Äôt even use spa sauna room without paying money only gym is free. Pool is decent but very busy
20,I got there WAY before check in and since they didnt have a similar room available I had to upgrade which was ok. The room was beautifully decorated with lots of room and they refreshed my room without me even asking which was a relief. Every time I left my room I couldn‚Äôt get back in with the same key I was constantly at the machine getting duplicate keys which was such a hassle because I didn't know I needed a new key until I got to my room then had to go all the way back down stairs to get new keys. One time I tested a key before I left to go to the casino and it worked so I didn't bring my ID I got up to my room and it didn't work so I had to walk all the way to other side of the hotel go wait in line for 30m before them telling me security would have to meet me at the room to check my ID security didnt take into account that I had to walk from the other side of the hotel so I ended up sitting in the hallway for 15m before they came. This hotel offered me no compensation for issues with the keys. I will never stay here again.
10,I've been staying at Caesars for over 25 years. Never again. Troubles started with no housekeeping for 2.5 days. Had to call four times to get service. charged $50 for valet parking. Almost $50 for daily resort fee...for which the only service was spotty internet. No chance to get a pool lounge without getting in line before pool opens or paying over $700 for a lounger. Coffee pot in the room - but you have to pay for coffee pods in the min-bar at $20+ for four. Taxi stand is almost 100 years from the front lobby - you have to drag your bags through a maze with no assistance from bell-stand Lots of gambling tables - but only one cashier. If you don't have status it's almost impossible to cash in chips without a 15 minute wait. When checking out - could not get a manager - just shuffled from one department to the next while clock was ticking for my flight. Clearly Caesars has made a decision to claw back lost revenue from the pandemic at the expense of the customer experience. Next trip I'll give an MGM property a try
30,Upon check in room smelled like weed. Called front desk and they cleaned and sprayed some stuff that helped with smell. Room had seen better days missing some drawers in cabinet under the TV. The worst was when I went to use the Keurig it had nasty brown water (?) in it. Showed front desk and they said would send someone right up to replace it. There 2 days longer.....never replaced.
30,We have stayed in Vegas multiple times and this time we choose to stay at Caesars. Way more expensive then our usual choice and the service was awful in comparison. Upon arrival we requested early check-in and we did arrive very early ( 7am) but were not able to get into our room until after 4pm. Once we got into our room it was dirty and the lasts guests dirty underwear were in our closet. We called to ask them to pick it up 4x to no avail. Thy didn't come to get it until the next afternoon almost 24 hours later. We had to get our own bags from the bellhop and almost missed our show. There were not enough staff for all of the guests they had. The phones didn't work correctly our room to reach the bellhop or front desk. Not planning on staying there again after paying two to three times as much as I usually do. Sub par to say the least.
30,"Although I visit the Caesar's Palace often in the forum shops as well as the QUA spa; this was my first experience staying at the Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. I stayed in the Augustus tower because I wanted a view of the Bellagio fountains. I did tip the desk attendant $20 cash at check in and I believe that worked in my favor as the room had a beautiful view! The room was slightly dated but well appointed and the bed was extremely comfortable! I also like that there was a Keurig coffee maker in the room and a Starbucks next to the first level elevators in the Augustus tower. I will also say the pool scene was phenomenal! I visited all the pools and they were exquisite. I HIGHLY recommend the QUA spa!    The reason I did not give this visit a five star review is because the bathtub siding was peeling off and exposed moldy areas. The bathtub also did not look very clean. Another con was the check-in and checkout process. The check-in line was almost an hour and a half wait. The checkout line was even longer! This may be due to COVID and being a shortage of staff. Hopefully they develop a process a little more updated soon.Lastly once I got home I noticed a charge on my credit card from the ""mini bar"" of which I didn't partake. I tried calling Caesars Palace multiple times but it was Very difficult to get a hold of somebody who could help me. When I disputed it with my credit card company I ended up eating the cost."
30,Just my personal opinion but Caesars is vastly overrated. Too big Too busy and Too expensive. Arrived on a Sunday and it took over an hour to check in. We stayed in the Octavius Tower and while the room was clean and spacious it needed a little maintenance here and there.
30,No room service the breakfast we did order online was terrible I booked a pool view room and I got a room overlooking the car park So MAKE SURE YOU READ T&C  Overall I would not return to this hotel We travelled from Ireland and were recommended this hotel very dissatisfied
10,Poor service. Constant trouble with keys for rooms not working. Messed up reservation. Had to stand in line to correct their failures resulting in 3 hours of wasted time. Heard of many similar complaints from other customers
40,"This is a very nice place to stay. Good restaurants nice service comfortable rooms. I like it. Having said that it definitely has some wear and tear and could use a freshening up compared to some of the hotels I have stayed at on the strip in recent years. The headboard of the bed was badly torn up which felt a bit creepy--as in ""What had been going on in this bed to cause this damage."" The cabinetry in the bathroom had areas where the finish was definitely worn off. It just looked like there was some deferred maintenance which I wouldn't expect in a hotel as nice as Caesars."
30,i always book(12 months in advance} and for two weeks !! I prefer the Palace Tower overlooking the Neptune Pool end.For some reason i was allocated the opposite end of the Tower which was very annoying.Also annoying was the pool closing time was sounded by the pool staff using high pitched whistles.
20,Even if you are a paying guest you are still charged a $50 parking fee for each day. My husband and I are senior citizens and still had to pay a $50 a day resort fee. Early checkin 30 minutes early was another $50. I doubt we will ever return
50,My boyfriend and I came with his brother and girlfriend and we booked separate rooms but didn't know that our rooms were in separate towers. In order for us to be in the same tower as them we would have had to pay about $300 extra which we didn't see as worth it. However Delano at the front desk hooked it up for us and upgraded our room to the same tower as them at no extra cost! We were so grateful for his unexpected kindness and generosity. He was overall just a very pleasant person and he really went out of his way to accommodate us and make sure we had a great stay.
20,The buffet along with many of the smaller food court restaurants were closed forcing us to dine in the more expensive restaurant. There are no refrigerators in the room so you can‚Äôt even take you over priced left overs to your room.
10,I booked a king size bed and when I got to the hotel I was given two queen size beds. They told me I would have to upgrade to receive the king size bed. Also when I finally got to the hotel room I washed my hands with soap and the sink was clogged. I called the service desk to ask if they can do anything about it they said they can send maintenance to fix it at 630 pm. I said ok but as I thought about it I didn‚Äôt want anyone in the room while I was out so I called service desk to cancel. They said it was cancelled but the maintenance gentlemen showed up at our room at 9 pm when I was showering. This was the worst stay. Everything was worn down the room was not clean and it was dusty. There were holes in the bed sheets. I Will definitely not stay here again.
30,The housekeeping didn't clean my room during my stay and my room was little dirty. At the front desk the hostess weren't kindness with us and they get mad when we ask for our keys.Caesars Palace has to give more service to their customers.
10,First day/ not enough water pressure to even flush the toilet. Waited till 7pm the second day to get a new room. Did not have any housekeeping for two more days. On the phone with the front desk for very long time only to be told to go to front desk. Spent a total of 3 & 1/2 hours in line at the front desk before getting so irritated that I just gave up. Old/aging hotel and not enough staff. DEFINITELY WILL NOT RETURN!!!!!
20,I waa so looking forward to staying at Caesar's.    Unfortunately the hotel did not live up to my expectations.    Firstly we were given the wrong room card i know mistakes do happen but the hassle i went through to get this resolved was apalling. Customer service was shocking.    After 2 days of no housekeeping i called down to be told that i had declined housekeeping which i hadn't. Out of our 5 day stay the room was cleaned once.    The pool area is lovely however most of the pools were closed duiring our stay and they hsd the cheek to close all the at 4pm one day due to a private function.    On a positive note the location is fab and the forum restaurants are good.
10,"Stayed in the two bedroom tower duplex suite beginning with check-in the experience was subpar. Although other resort guests may skip the 30-60 minute traditional check-in line by using the check-in kiosks suite guests must wait in the traditional line for some unknown reason. After that annoying experience checked into the tower duplex suite to find every couch worn with cigarette burns corners of the room that had not been cleaned in months/years (accumulation of dead bugs dirt and ""other"") and dirt on every other surface. Although we expected some wear given the suite's reputation as the ""best party suite"" in Vegas we still expected a clean room which we did not receive. The room was as big as advertised and the view was great if you can ignore the filth that you would find at a $75/night room then this is for you."
10,I planned to take my daughter to Vegas for the first time since turning 21. I thought a while about the best place to be safe enjoy our experience and to have stores close by. Upon arrival we had to wait in the checkin line for over an hour. The front desk agent wasn't the nicest had to asked about housekeeping as I overheard from the several others checking in at the same time. We had paid for one upgrade I asked for a room close to the elevator which I was informed they only had 1 room with double beds left in the entire Augustus tower. I find that hard to believe. Upon arriving to the room tub was dirty and shampoo/conditioner bottles that someone had used prior were still in the shower with no soap in the room. We ended up having an issue at the casino with my daugther's id and she wasn't able to gamble. I called down the front desk to ask if we could checkout early after night 2 without paying for night 3- after all we wouldn't be staying explained why and they refused to let us checkout early without paying for an additional night. I then asked to speak to the front desk manager which I was told I would have to go down and wait in line to do so. I informed them that I waited it in over an hour the previous night and they said nothing they could do. This was such a bad experience so many options on the strip don't think I would ever go back.
40,This review reiterates lengthy check in line as we couldn't use the fairly available kiosks near bye. Slipping a Vegas sandwedge we were sorted for three rooms and all in the Augustus tower with excellent views. Though street noise on 30th floor. Yes rooms have a little ware and tare with zero comps that defy the price tag. Pool not that deep and no shade. Food choices dismal and expensive. Staff encountered all good. But all in all decent and not fabulous that price tag would expect
10,The first thing I noticed when I walked into the room was the weird smell coming from the bathroom like someone just used it but I know nobody was in there for a couple of hours. The smell was either coming from the hall from other smelly guests or the smell originated in the bathroom and emanated into the hallway
20,"Because our flight was changed to an evening flight and by the time we got to the hotel it was 11 pm we stood in line for nearly an hour. It was past midnight when we got to our room but we were charged the $50 a day ""resort"" fee. Although we had reserved a King room back in February we were given a room with two beds in the Octavius Tower nearly the furthest point from everywhere. The agent who checked us in mumbled something about us requesting a different room ""later."" Once we were unpacked there was no way we were going to change rooms. Keurig coffeemaker was nice except you had to buy pods from the room snack tray at a ridiculous price. You could also not put any item of your into the ""snack refrigerator"" without paying a fee. The two Starbucks charged twice what local ones charge. We were shorted on linens. There was no ""guide book"" in the room no room service menu. Apparently only techies stay there. At 78 this was so inconvenient in so many ways. Prices were exorbitant for everything. Do your research folks. If you are looking for good service hospitable staff and convenience Ceasars is NOT the place."
20,We‚Äôve been to this hotel and have always been pleased. This time however the room was not thoroughly clean the phone did not work and was filthy it smelled like cigarette smoke and I had requested nonsmoking one sink in the bathroom was clogged up and it smelled. I did not want anyone in my room due to Covid and luckily I carry me Lysol with me. Terribly disappointed customer service at check out was slow and rude.
20,Travelled to Las Vegas for a business conference and stayed at Caesars Palace for 5 nights. Two of my colleagues and I had to wait around 40 min in line to Registration. Once we got to speak with the hotel rep we asked to be placed at the same Tower and preferably the same floor and were told that it would not be possible because our company booked different rooms for us fair enough... When we asked if the rooms were of the same quality the hotel rep assured us that this is the case which turned out to be misleading to say the least.  Upon entering the room I was hit by unpleasant smell the furniture was banged and scratched bedding had holes and to top it off there was mold/fungus growing on the walls in the bathroom. The shower waterflow was so strong that it literally hurt my skin.  That same evening I called concierge complained about the state of the room and asked to be moved to a better room. The person on the line told me to come to Registration desk next day between certain hours and speak with a manager. When I told her that I'm working during those hours throughout my stay she answered that is what I need to do if I want to be moved and stay in the long line to the Registration if necessary. But she promised to file my complaint with a manager in the meantime.  There was no attempt by the manager to reach out to me to suggest a new room - nothing of the sort  Never staying at Caesars Palace again
10,After a 14 hours flight having to queue for 30mn to checkin is just not acceptable‚Ä¶not enough people and very slow process. Never experienced this anywhere. Its a lack of respect for their clientd‚Ä¶..
20,Octavius Premium room. Dirty Broken worn out room. See my pictures. Do yourself a favor and don't book here. Front Desk acknowledged room was dated and did nothing. I booked a premium room because I wanted something a little nicer. What a mistake and waste of money.
30,We had saved for two years to go to Vegas. There was 6 of us me and my husband my two girls with husband and boyfriend. I booked in January for a May trip. I booked 3 Augustus Tower Fountain View Rooms. Upon arrival two were available and one was not. I showed them my reservation and deposit and demanded another of what I had booked. It took forever to get it straight. So that was my first strike against them. I overheard a guy in elevator later on that had the same problem. After we were there a couple days me and one of my daughters had a message on our room phones. Mine said I needed to come down and take care of charges. This was about 12:30 pm and there was a massive line. We waited about 15 min. I had called my credit card and verified all was fine. I finally went to the ppl at the kiosk line as it was shorter. They said that someone had checked out of my daughters room and we needed to get the bags out. I told them definitely not as all three of my rooms were booked until the 21st and that we had not checked out. I was so mad. The girl went to check with the manager and he comped us the taxes for one night on the room. I asked to spread to him. I asked how this happed and one of the desk clerks had accidentally checked us out. This should have been handled behind the scenes instead if me spending an hour downstairs and never got an apology or sorry for the inconvenience. I told him there dams sure better not be another strike while we were there and I‚Äôd never stay there again simply because they are incompetent. In the mean time my daughter was on phone checking her message and they told her she needed to get her bags and leave. She told them no and that I as downstairs throwing to find out what happened. They made too many mistakes. It was absolutely ridiculous that we had to fight for what we booked and then asked to leave when we hadn‚Äôt checked out. Manager was awful desk people went not nice the nicest people were the sweet house cleaning ladies on our 30th floor. They were very nice and helpful the best employees there! We will not stay at Caesar‚Äôs again. The room was excellent after we fought for it the view breath taking but not worth all the fighting for all the money we paid for 3 rooms and no remorse for their screw ups!
20,I attended a business convention in early May of 2022 and stayed at Bally's which is where the convention was held. Our group received discounted room rates and also the ridiculous 'resort fee' was also waived for all of our attendees.    The convention was great and the service within the various rooms including two days of spectacular lunches provided by Bally's was excellent.    That said the overall experience of staying at a 'resort' fell far short of the mark. Bally's is the old MGM Grand and the rooms still contain remnants of that era.    We arrived to a dirty room - bathroom was obviously not cleaned from the previous guest and little things like no additional toilet paper no drinking glasses were immediately noticeable. Not a single piece of literature anywhere in the room directing us as to where we could: eat order room service etc. It's all about loading their ridiculous app on your phone and doing everything with that.    Coffee makers in the room are apparently a thing of the past (although the lower priced motel chains maintain these) as Bally's offers one coffee shop (with one person manning it) across from the front desk to provide you with a $7 cup of coffee. Prepare to wait though as each morning I attempted to get a cup the line was practically out the door.    One restaurant in the entire hotel - an overpriced burger joint understaffed and unable to accommodate a party of 6 people.    Check in was another joke - two people manning the front desk and a line out the door while staff attempted to corral people into a second line for the 'convenient' kiosk to bypass check-in at the desk. Another joke as I waited in that line only to find out the system could not verify the credit card I had used to book my room. Back into the other line and wait...    This place severely lacks personal service. Everything is sterile and made to look easy and all inclusive but that is just a look. The cost of everything within Bally's is a joke and it's presented with a straight face. From $35/day valet parking (plus tip if you're a guest) $7 coffees to $11 domestic beers it's quite obvious that the 'new norm' in Las Vegas is simply to extract every dime possible from you and provide as little as possible in return. Gone are the days where Las Vegas appreciated you gambling and spending your money with them and they rewarded you with free drinks inexpensive buffets and great food and entertainment at reasonable prices.    That experience is gone and now it's all about impersonal service app-based interaction and overpriced amenities and rooms.    I heard echoes of my own experience in the elevators and just chatting with other folks staying there. Common complaints: dirty rooms lack of information as to how to find restaurants stores etc. and overall fees taxes and costs.    I appreciate that our company negotiated our room rates and were able to get Bally's to waive the 'resort fee' as I would have likely stayed elsewhere.    My stay really enlightened me to what Las Vegas has become and I have no desire to repeat the experience. Calling yourself a 'resort' doesn't necessarily make you so and Bally's falls far shy of the image they are trying to present.    Between dirty rooms poor service and overpriced amenities I could easily find better value elsewhere.
30,it was our first time staying at Caesars palace and the room was great but cleanliness wise not so‚Ä¶there were stains on the couch and a palm print on the headboard‚Ä¶it was not a pleasant sight to see when you‚Äôre lying down in bed trying to relaxand you someone elses palm print next to you‚Ä¶
20,Very disappointed with the hotel. I‚Äôve been to Vegas 6 times previously and was not happy with so many things.  1. Room not made up 3 times.  2. 10 dollars for water  3. No free coffee facilities in the room  4. Only one of the 6 pools were free and massively over crowded with disco music blaring all day so we would go to the bellagio which was all free And had a poolside cafe  5. Unbelievably in 37 degrees heat no parasols available !    I could go on but for a 5 star hotel terrible by comparison to bellagio
20,Bad experience. Someone told me to watch my bill - he was right. I paid for the reservation in advance. Once I arrived - the lady asked me if I had parked there - which I did. They charged me 18 USD for it. They said we could just insert the key and it would let us out of the parking lot. However when we left - we had to swipe the card again and charged us another 18 USD.    P√©ssima experi√™ncia. Uma pessoa me disse para conferir a conta. Ele tava certo. Paguei a reserva antes. Quando cheguei a atendente me perguntou se eu estava com carro no estacionamento - eu estava. Me cobraram 18 USD. Me disseram que poderia inserir o cart√£o (chave) e abriria a cancela do estacionamento. Mas quando sa√≠mos - tive de passar o cart√£o de novo e foi cobrado mais 18 USD.
10,I got in after a full day of traveling and waited over an hour just to check in. The express check in kiosks were shut down. The room was nice but the hotel smelled like smoke and I developed smoke allergies after a couple of days of breathing the air.
20,The check in process is archaic - extremely long lines and the kiosks for online check in close in the early evening. The front desk staff was the most unprofessional and rude employees I‚Äôve run into‚Ä¶ever. Daily housekeeping didn‚Äôt always happen - when it didn‚Äôt I called to request clean towels which never came. It was near impossible to encounter a staff member who provided good service or was at the bare minimum friendly. The only saving grace for Caesars was the pool and pool bar serving staff - they were friendly and attentive. This hotel has become mid at best‚Äîinattentive unfriendly staff and horrible front desk service. If you are just looking for a semi affordable trip to Vegas this place might work. If you have standards and expectations for service don‚Äôt bother.
20,"I have been to Vegas many times. We usually stay at MGM but decided to try Caesars because of it's central location and recommendations from others. We checked in on a Monday at 3 o clock thinking this was a usual check in time for hotels...we were told our room wasn't ready and that the check in time was 4. We returned at 4:20pm. There were about 100 people waiting to check in and only 4 people checking people in. Their kiosks we're not working so it took 35 minutes of waiting in line to be told at now almost 5 o clock our room still was not ready. Meanwhile people who were checking in next to me were also being told that their room was not ready but we're ""upgraded"" to a better room at no charge. I asked if this was a possibility for me and was told it would be 60 dollars extra a night. I finally got my room about 45 minutes later only to be disappointed again. The furniture was beat up and had stains/burns. The bathroom door was broken and the mirrors were dirty. My tv did not work and it took an hour to get somebody from maintenance to fix it. I had very high hopes for this popular Vegas strip hotel but was very disappointed and will be staying at MGM from now on."
10,This trip was a disaster from the start. We had questions about booking and cabanas but could not speak with anybody on the hotel at all.    Checking in lines were extremely long (1.5 hours) the online check-in systems weren‚Äôt working and simple requests we made ahead for my disability were ‚Äúnot able to be made there.‚Äù The people on the phone said it‚Äôs front desk fault and front desk said it wasn‚Äôt their fault. Not ok.    The lady that we spoke to at check-in was incredibly rude and dismissive. Later that night when our friends tried to check in they accessed the line for e-check in as was directed in the email that was sent. After waiting forever in that line they got to the front desk and were asked if they were diamond members. When they said no the staff told them to go to the end of the long line next to them even though the signs in the lines and directions in the emails did not say that at all. The sign clearly stated they were where they were supposed to be yet they were rudely dismissed. After talking to multiple managers it didn‚Äôt help. Again very rude and dismissive. They said we were trying to skip the line and cut in front of other people and also said ‚Äúthey were about to go change the sign‚Äù that according to them should‚Äôve been changed two hours prior. How is that our fault?    So an additional wait and a longer line was up next when the process time for checking them in took less than two minutes when it finally happened. It was absolutely ridiculous that this wasn‚Äôt done the first time around.    We were told a manager would contact us the next day but that never happened. We had to call and call again and finally spoke to somebody just before we checked out. But even that person wasn‚Äôt very helpful and we had to track down the accommodation they offered. This was appreciated but also hardly made up for all of the shortcomings. I‚Äôm still trying to get answers from a manager about another charge we don‚Äôt recognize. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs something we owe‚Ä¶I just want to clarify what it us. And we sure weren‚Äôt waiting in those hour-plus long lines before heading to the airport.    Also the texting system set up to take requests for any needs at the hotel was spotty as well. Two days in a row we requested house keeping service fresh towels etc. but none of those services were provided even after multiple attempts to schedule. Internet service was terrible and phone calls only worked when next to a window.    This was our first trip to Caesars Palace Las Vegas we were really looking forward to it but I will definitely not be back. Incredibly disappointing.
30,I booked this trip with multiple sources telling us how eat Ceasers is to stay at.  We are paying a daily resort fee of over $50 for 25% of their gym equipment to not be working and not all the pools to be open. As well as overall maintence was lacking. Some of the lights in our room didn‚Äôt work our fridge vibrated constantly making it hard to sleep and the elevators always had a glitch of some sort. Check in and check out was also not convenient.
20,Thought I would have had a better time in ceasar‚Äôs. Staff was rude and if something breaks you might not get it fixed until next day. Took hour half for my bags. No assistance for my mother trying to book a limo apparently they don‚Äôt have a concierge as the lady says ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have concierge‚Äù with a big ass sign that says concierge. The pool was decent room was ok but tv wasn‚Äôt working big hype 1st and last time staying at ceasar. Bellagio or mirage was better in my opinion. My wolf pack was not happy smsmall8@gmail.com
50,Hard to find around the place at first but we did but so much building and remodeling. We got lose again hahaha It a really nice hotel and with the pandemic we were lucky that we never had to wait long . thank you Caesars for a nice stay.
50,The room was perfect the staff was friendly and very helpful!! Great food great atmosphere and everything your heart desires at 1 location... we had a group of 8 friends 4 stayed at a different location but ended wishing they stayed here and spent the majority of time here... the pool is phenomenal and so is the shopping!! Loved it
50,Nice hotel but like everything else in Vegas prices were high. Shower door door leaked and bathroom sink was very slow to drain. They have a sign in the room stating the mini fridge is only for the mini bar and there is a $75 charge to place personal items in it. They also claim that the mini bar and food tray are on scales so they know if an item is removed and even if you put it back you may be charged for that item. Checked the prices and they were astronomical. However all employees were very professional and attentive. Wonderful pools also.
50,My husband and I stayed at the Nobu Tower in Caesars Palace 5/5-5/9 and we had a fabulous time! The property was clean staff was professional at all times and great restaurants on property too.  Daniel was wonderful at the start of our experience at the Nobu check-in. We loved the private check in and semi private elevators. The entire trip was great! His colleagues were also super helpful during our stay answering any questions we had to making a reservation for dinner at Nobu last minute.    We were disappointed the largest iconic pool was under repair and closed though. Overall we enjoyed it and would recommend Caesars!
20,"My wife and I just returned from Las Vegas and we stayed at Caesars in a Julius Tower Deluxe Suite on the ""Signature"" floor (15th). $500+ a night. The only thing ""Deluxe"" about it was the price. The impression (and they are very vague about many things in their advertising) was that it was a high amenity floor compared to others. It is not. We spoke to numerous other guests on this floor and they were all disappointed or fully pissed about being mis-lead. The room/suite is fine but very similar to most of the rooms in the Julius Tower many of which are half the price. My only reason for choosing Julius is that it is very convenient to the center of action and I have mobility issues. It came through on that. My brother was in the Palace Tower which is hell and gone from the main attractions but his room for half of what we paid was twice as large and much better decorated.    On the nickel and diming I was blown away by the hubris of this place. No personal stuff in the mini bar fridge or they will charge you $75 just for opening it and not buying something. You get a coffee maker but the coffee has to be purchased from the mini-bar at 10 times a reasonable price with no cream or creamer. Unreal. And the list could go on.    On a more general scale we had not been to Vegas in 4 years (like many I presume) and the price jump is insane since then - for everything. So many restaurants have closed and remain so that reservations are hard to come by - especially the higher end places. This is true at Caesars and throughout Vegas. But I don't give Caesars a pass when half of their Forum Food Court places are vacant. We purchased from the Halal place one afternoon and it was awful. We did get into Bobby Flay's Amalfi and that was wonderful    My advice is to take advantage of the strip for its excitement and energy but purchase beer and wine from CVS right across the street from Caesars (or bring your own) and go to the many great restaurants off-strip. Our favorite is the Lotus of Siam on Flamingo - a world class Thai restaurant - but there are many others.    When we come back to Vegas we will not be staying at Caesars. Maybe Downtown?"
20,Poor service from start to finish. From check-in to checking out and heading to distance poorly marked with no assistance tax line. I recommend not staying here. I come to Vegas 5x/yr. Stay at Bellagio Aria Park or Venetian.
10,Where do I start the exterior of the hotel is great and that‚Äôs pretty much all that is great about this place.    Firstly when we arrived we were told we couldn‚Äôt check in until 4pm but if we wanted to get a room earlier we could pay 55 dollars (convenient that they could find us a room ready for some extra money)    We got put in the Forum tower (if you get out there don‚Äôt even check the room just ask to be moved) The rooms look like they‚Äôre from the 1900‚Äôs scuffed and broken cabinets rust on the door frame and a broken sink that wouldn‚Äôt empty to top it off we had a view of a concrete building not what you expect when you pay a lot of money to stay in the ‚ÄúFabulous‚Äù Caesars Palace.    When we checked out we were charged a 52 dollar per night resort fee on each room we had now this is an absolute joke considering if you get to the pool any later than 8am (it doesn‚Äôt open until 9am so you have to wait in line for an hour) you will not be getting a sun lounger and will have to pay 500 dollars for a day bed or 100 dollars per sun lounger that they keep aside to charge people for. Every day there were people having to sit on the floor around the pool because they couldn‚Äôt get a sun lounger.    Don‚Äôt be fooled when they tell you they have 7 swimming pools. The main circular pool is only open 2 days a week on a Saturday and Sunday yet no one tells you this another one of the pools is the size of about 2 bedrooms and another one is a private pool so really there is only 4 which are ridiculously packed with everyone trying to fit in.    They also tried to charge us for the minibar which we hadn‚Äôt touched they just hadn‚Äôt filled it up before we got in there.    To top it all off the staff are rude and on our second day they started construction all over the hotel areas were closed off and all you could hear is drilling and smashing around from about 7am.    I would never stay here again I‚Äôve previously stayed at the Bellagio and that was so much nicer and much better value for money. If you choose to stay here then good luck.    Pros -    Exterior of hotel    Cons -    Rooms  Interior of hotel  Pools or lack of  Queues  Staff  Value for money
10,We travelled from the UK for my stag-do as our previous stays at Caesars were good.    Sadly it is a shadow of its former self.    Our Octavious premium room was anything but.    The bed headboards in both rooms were ripped the cupboards are all chipped with doors hanging off everything is now way overpriced ($80 for 3 drinks by the pool) check-in took over an hour we booked the trip so we could see Sir Rod as part of the stag and waited in-line to have a pre-show photo with Caesars appointed agent having then waited for almost an hour after the show we were told our photos had been 'lost' the manager said he would text me the next day but unsurprisingly we heard nothing. This happened to quite a few people they simply don't understand how upsetting this can be. They used to pump a nice fragrance around the hotel as well that's gone so it's just a stuffy smoky smell even in the corridoors. The prices have also gone up to stay here drastically they are charging the same if not more than a stay at The Wynn but without the same service or product.  We were also surprised that a hotel of this prices does not have a fridge in the room - we were previously given one for my medication and were told it was something they were considering doing - this time they brought up a mini-plastic cooler which quite simply did not get cool enoughwe asked reception if they could supply a normal fridge (this portable one also had a very noisy fan on constantly) and were told they cannot supply these now. Consequently my medication was spoiled.    We complained at the front desk and suggested they waive the resort fee (a joke to even charge for WiFi in this day and age and to cap it all you are capped at two devices per room - utter nonsense). The check-out agent was plain rude he wasn't willing to even hear our genuine complaints and brushed us away with a corporate brush-off. Looking at recent reviews on here it is clear that this is a common occurrence and they are now trading on their previous name and couldn't care less about customer service.    We will never return to Caesars and booked The Wynn this morning for another friends 40th Birthday bash in September.
20,We arrived before 10 am and checked in at the front desk. We registered with the representative.  We were told that they would let us know via text when our room was ready and that we wouldn't have to wait in line again simply go to the kiosk. at 3:26 we receive a text. Room is ready. We arrive at the ENORMOUS line for check in and for the kiosk. After trying to use the kiosk a representative was able to get us our keys for our room. 4:30 for a 4 pm check in. No one seemed to care about all of the customers who were waiting. Very poor customer service. Very disappointing. The only really lovely person we encountered was our bellhop Alexi.
50,Arrived late to check in but Chelsea at the front desk made me feel so welcome. Our room and the service throughout was unmatched. The pool and decor made for a ton of great pictures. Prime location. Thank you!
20,I rarely complain publicly but for a hotel of this stature the stay has been a disappointment. They don‚Äôt clean the rooms. We asked for the service at 5pm and when it did not occur and a bag of towels were brought and my wife was asked to empty the garbage herself. Really? We were told they were running behind so we let it go for another five hours. When the room was not tended to at 10pm I requested Caesars to remove the resort fee. They would not do it saying the resort fee covered internet as well. It‚Äôs a great reason to make this our last stay at Caesars and to never bet another cent here.
10,Lines for both self and front desk check in. No one available on phone to talk- recorded message says call in 48 hours. Line to get luggage from bellman. Not sure its just with this casino or everyone
10,I've been coming to and staying at Caesars Palace for 7-10 days a year for 25+ years. While the casino in Caesars Palace has been consistently improving the hotel side of Caesars under the leadership of the hotel management has been declining for several years. In the post-pandemic era the Caesars Palace hotel is being run the worse I've seen it in decades. You can book a specific Tower and View and then registration will just say 'sorry' and put you in some other type of room with a completely different or no view.    I'm a multi-year Diamond Elite with Caesars Rewards and easily earn 75000 tier credits in less than a week. If the hotel doesn't honor my reservations made 2 months in advance for an Augustus Strip view of the Bellagio fountains for my 50th birthday then people who haven't been coming here for 25+ years with Diamond Elite status don't stand a chance.    I will not be staying at Caesars Palace again until I read that hotel senior leadership has been replaced and significant changes have been made to improve both guest relationships and honoring reservations booked months in advance. I've informed my casino host at Caesars Palace that the hotel senior leadership and the way the Caesars Palace hotel is being run is the reason I will not be returning.    There is a growing number of long time Caesars Palace and Caesars Rewards players who have been staying at Caesars Palace for years and they all say the same thing about the hotel management. Avoid Caesars Palace.
30,Pricey with very few good perks. The room was very nice. Check-in was chaotic. Directions to the room were poor. Dragging suitcases around trying to follow signs through the casino was awful. Everything was overpriced ($5.50 for a bottle of Aquafina tap water). Not even a complementary cup of coffee in the room - $22 for 4 k-pods from the mini bar. Over an hour standing in line to get breakfast (only to be told parts of the breakfast menu had ended). Buffet sounded good. Next open reservation is next week. Average is probably a stretch.
20,It was a disappointment. It Took 1 1/2 hours in line to check-in. Terribly unprepared for guests arrival. Room was dated and dirty on arrival. Had a difficult time getting room cleaned every day of our stay. Compared to similarly priced hotels on the strip Caesars is well bellow in service and quality. Location and shows were great.
20,Not a good visit. The valet and parking signage sucks. Ended up going to the wrong valet and then the valet near the self parking had no bell service. Complimentary self parking and valet is misleading. The row of check in kiosks near self parking were not working. Check in lines were ridiculously long. The lady who assisted me at the check in kiosk argued with me and said she couldn‚Äôt apply my points until checkout which meant I‚Äôd have to wait in like again on Sunday. However another employee was able to apply them when I asked on Saturday. The concert venue was good. The spa and massage were the saving grace of this trip. I won‚Äôt be back. I prefer Palazzo.
10,Prob one of the worst stays I have stayed at in Las Vegas I go multiple times a year and a Caesar‚Äôs reward member. I upgraded our stay for a suit for wife‚Äôs bday prob one of the worst dated rooms there is at Caesar‚Äôs. Also got charged for early check in when they never txted me that my room was ready and when it was it was like 30 mins before check in. I will not be staying at Caesar‚Äôs palace ever again very disappointed customer. There is no where u can complain our room was dirty and the cabinets were falling apart also the heater was broken. Only had 1 roll of toilet paper and only 1 towel.
30,Forum rooms are tired and a bit grubby feeling. For > $400 per night I expected a bit more glam. The 2 device internet limit is mean for a resort fee of > $50 per day. All in all not a great deal but central and on the strip so ‚Ä¶  top pro tip: download the Caesar‚Äôs App and do the express checkin. Checkin was a ZOO. Even express was a disaster - machines without toner and the one guy running it overwhelmed. Imagine supermarket self checkout but everyone has a fully cart. But with the app I jumped the line of people waiting to speak to the lone rep got the keys and even tho the receipt didn‚Äôt print and I didn‚Äôt know our room number but it WAS on the app. Their email system was also down so I never got the QR code emailed for checkin but it still worked. I spent 24 hours at the hotel and didn‚Äôt speak to a single Caesar‚Äôs employee - is that a good thing in the hospitality industry?
20,Ceasar's Palace is a grand and tired hotel. We arrived Monday May 11th and left Friday May 14th. Our room was #363 in the Julius Tower. Location was convenient for how we wanted to use the resort but the property is enormous so everything was still a walk. My advice is to keep your mobility level in mind if you book a room here.    Check in service wasn't too bad since we arrived on a Monday. We did express check-in and only stood in line about 30 minutes. However Thursday and Friday night we watched people standing in horrendously long lines! I've no question that they were in line far longer. This is the result of Caesar's policy that charges $55 extra for you to check in before 4 PM. After seeing the lines Thursday and Friday night I recommend arriving early and paying the extra money to avoid the frustration of standing in line 2 hours.    Julius Tower room 363 has a view of the roof. The carpet is stained and torn in a couple places. The furniture was knicked and scratch but everything in the bathroom worked. Aside from that everything appeared clean with no stains on the bedding or towels. The bedding was of good quality. The towels however were rough and of poor quality but not stained or dirty. They are very stingy with the towels contact housekeeping immediately to ask for extra towels and for your room to be cleaned and freshened daily. Yes that's right. They won't be cleaning your room daily unless you ask for it.    Absolutely EVERYTHING you buy there will be exorbitantly priced. In general Las Vegas is no longer a place to go for a reasonably priced vacation. $26 for two rum and cokes. We paid $10 for a bottle of water inside the Collesium while attending a show there.    Overall customer service people were friendly and helpful.    We will not stay here again but then after 4 trips to Vegas we won't be back. It was the most shockingly expensive trip we've ever taken.
10,The buildings the casino and the rooms are spacious and nicely decorated. However it is nothing you shouldn't expect for the price.    The technology (especially in the rooms) is very out-dated and the guest service overall is nothing but poor. We arrived on a friday and the check in process took more than 1.5 hours. Furthermore we and everyone else (according to an employee) had trouble getting the luggage.    All in all it was a lot of waiting. Generally speaking only the overly expensive drinks helped with the guests' frustration.
20,The room we paid extra for was nothing like the pictures on the website. From damaged furniture stained linens broken faucets and even a broken toilet. We traveled with another couple and their room was just as bad. The stuff explained this as ‚Äúwear and tear.‚Äù We we‚Äôre given $50 dollars in resort credits and 1 night was comped for the broken toilet. I was completely disappointed all we wanted was the room they showed on the website which we simply didn‚Äôt not get. We also paid for a cabana for two days and the mens bathroom for the entire pool complex was down to a single toilet and urinal and was absolutely disgusting. On the second day we were upgraded to a different part of the resort w where we had access to a private mens room for a small part of the pool area which was much nicer. So nice in fact we would observe the staff walking upstairs and using the only clean bathroom in the pool area which was kept from most tables of the people using the pool.
50,Really cool place! You could spend half a day here and don‚Äôt gamble! Tons of restaurants and tons of shops. Massive casino that doesn‚Äôt look like a casino on the outside. Plenty of high end stored all throughout. I was really really impressed with the art and decor. I couldn‚Äôt help but look like a tourist! My head to the ceiling look from top to bottom. Even the benchers are leather.
10,The furniture was all damaged and and soda running down the walls. there was filth in the room with hair and floors were dirty and old. I have stayed in most Casino resorts in Vegas and this is by far the worst of them with service and it is just old and gringy throughout the casino and rooms.
10,Been here before but this time I found that in spite of being a diamond player being offered a room at the Augustus tower I was put into the Forum tower in a disgusting room. Caesars charged me $430 for two tickets that Ticketmaster was selling for $160 each. I will never come again to Caesars
40,Hotel looks amazing beautiful room bathroom clean lobby looks really rich  All my stay was really nice but for this category and price was two minus  Wi-fi was limited and only 2 device for next one must pay  And more worst for me  Was lady from reception  When i go make check out don't say back to me good morning only what do you want  I am is disgusted this person in this hotel  When back to LV i take other hotel
50,My visit to Las Vegas started out very good with Sofia P at the check in registration desk. She was polite courteous and very professional. She got my husband and I checked in without any delays. Kudos to her for a job well done! She deserves special recognition!!! Please convey my sincere thanks to her.
10,Room was was changed without my knowledge and when confronted they said it's in the fine print.  Upon check out for last two nights they tried to charge me 5x and 10x the booked rates.  First and last time Caesars Palace.
40,We decided to go to Vegas for our honeymoon and chose Caesars Palace as it has a good reputation. We paid A LOT for Caesars and expected the quality they advertise. After wishing 45 minutes and check in and we got to the room we were so disappointed. Dirty stained and smelt like cigarette. The little things didn‚Äôt work like the tv in the bathroom and the buttons for the curtains. If we were staying two nights we‚Äôd have just accepted this and moved on however we were there for two weeks and paid an arm and a leg for the room.    We headed downstairs and waited another 30 minutes and spoke with the manager on duty. He told us he‚Äôd arrange another room for us (the same room type just another room which was obviously completely acceptable and we expected nothing more) but that it couldn‚Äôt be done that day and that he‚Äôd make notes in our reservation and that we should head down in the morning and pick up the new keys. The morning came we packed our bags and headed down to the front desk. We spoke with Tangela. Unfortunately the manager from the day prior had not left any notes and Tangela had no idea what we were talking about. I explained the situation to her and she was very kind and understanding. She immediately found us another room to check into and very very kindly upgraded us which was appreciated and unexpected.    Obviously the start wasn‚Äôt great and the rooms need a little TLC but the rest of our stay was comfortable and we appreciated Tangela‚Äôs help. The housekeeping were wonderful and did a great job.    I‚Äôd recommend upgrading from the standard room because it was extremely well used and not well maintained.
50,Eric with the Seven Stars/Diamond Check in Desk was amazing! He greeted us with prompt service helpful information an upgrade & a smile. He went above and beyond to get our room upgraded so we could enjoy our stay even more. Thank you Eric & keep up the great work!
50,This is my first time staying at Caesar‚Äôs Palace and this won‚Äôt be my last. After having a rough night traveling to Vegas Tangela made us feel at ease. She was very helpful and very professional. Thank you!
10,I dont even know where to start. It was the worst vegas stay ive ever had. The check in lines were and hour plus long. I had to do it twice once for me and once for my grandma. After waiting an hour or more you get to the counter at 2pm and they charge you an early check in fee of $50. How is 2pm early? They get you here because if you don‚Äôt pay you have to come back at 4 and wait again. We requested daily house keeping‚Ä¶ only got it once after multiple requests. Had to use towels we had put on the floor ran out of shampoo. My room keys weren‚Äôt working for free parking as i am a platinum member. It charged me $23 every time i left the parking garage. 5 times $23 customer service would only refund me for 3 of the charges. When I explained my frustration about our stay the customer service agent shrugged his shoulders and blew me off. Im not typically one to complain but this was absolutely the worst stay and customer service ive ever encountered in vegas. I will be closing my caesars credit and will never stay at one of their resorts again.
40,Offering a coffee maker in the room and then charging $20 for the coffee is a little steep. If you open the fridge for personal use it‚Äôs $75! Go across the street to the CVS and get anything you want.
40,I've been to Vegas dozens of times but this was my first stay at Caesars Palace. I had a king non-smoking room in the Octavius tower. It had a pool view partial strip view and mountain view which was perfect for me. The room was larger than I expected and looked nice but is starting to show some signs of aging. My biggest complaint is the lack of USB ports. There was only one. The hotel itself is gigantic so the rooms are a bit far from the action. I finally figured out some short cuts by the end of my stay though. The pool area is beautiful and the service was great. Overall I had a very nice stay.
20,If you can get pass the smell of cigarettes everything being so far from each other a 30-45 minute check-in line $100 per night incidental hold and beds that leave you feeling like you just went 12 rounds with Mike Tyson then this is the place for you. I stayed here for a conference and still have yet to receive my hotel folio. It took me 3 weeks to recover from my stay here. I request just towel service then had to call every day for fresh towels. My room was dusty and the location just above the A/C vents. I will never stay at a casino hotel again.
30,Stayed at Caesars Augustus.  Only stayed here because I got a discount. Would not stay here for full price. The cleanliness was questionable. Did they change the sheets? I found hair on the bed. Long red hair and eye lash or something and another piece of hair.    Called reception and the receptionist sounded like she didn‚Äôt want to be there. Asked her if she can send house keeping to give me new sheets and new comforter. Took a while to get this. It was already 11 pm and was dying to sleep.    Had to replace the sheets myself.    The bathroom also had a wet towel outside the shower and found hair in the tub which I never used.    The view was there was no view except the back of the buildings.    Wouldn‚Äôt stay at this old rinky dink hotel.
30,"My first trip to Las Vegas I stayed at Caesars Palace. Given the iconic ethos of the establishment I'd definitely expected a better experience and exceptional hospitality. From arrival CP disappointed.    At this level of hotel it was surprising to see how much it lacked in even the most basic gestures like the lack of help carrying in bags from the car/to the car. We had to stand in line for an hour TWICE to even check in and the front desk staff was unfriendly and unwelcoming - they seemed irritated to be there. The room was unremarkable and it was disappointing to pay so much for a room and be charged for coffee in the room. The hotel itself REEKS of smoke; I mean come on it's 2022! The view from the room was a wall of rooms and a rooftop with ac units... lame. Ultimately the founding objective of the hotel was to make every guest ""feel like a caeser""... they've degraded and most certainly missed the mark."
30,The check-in process was disappointing and long. Waited for over an hour to check-in. No valet service to speak of. The room was nice in a quiet part of the hotel. Restaurants were great. No real personal service from any of the staff. The Caesar staff needs to go to Hospitality school all over again. This art is lost on Caesars Palace.
40,A classic! The location is great but unfortunately the property needs a renovation ASAP. Rooms appearance is to old and the cleaning service is not te best‚Ä¶ I stayed at Forum Tower. Dining and shopping options are really good! Casino is not the best.
50,First time staying at Caesar‚Äôs and we loved it! We originally postponed our trip twice but finally made it! We arrived late on Monday but were able to receive an upgrade for a Strip View room in Augustus tower. Highly recommend! We had a beautiful spacious room with a view of the fountains. The room had a stocked mini bar a jacuzzi and a separate sofa. Incredible location with a comfy bed. The room was off American Cafe (with a bar) and two sundrie stores. I would absolutely stay here again!
10,"we figure we had some offer sent to us for comps room for caesar palace we reserve couple rooms for our partys each room we reserve double beds. and we make sure ahead of time that we will get the room before booking.    upon our arrival when we check in thursday night for our room the front dest gentleman told us they give our room away and only give us single beds. we told him to talk to his manager and see why and what they can do for us cause we have 9 of us now we only get king bed this mean we all have to share each room sleep on same bed together. they told us they can't do anything about it and told us to come in the morning to see if they can switch our room to double beds when someone check out in the morning.    now the morning comes we went to front desk and got this women name ""Jeanie."" we told her what happen the night before and ask if they have any double beds to change for us. This worker told us they never can change room and never heard of changing room policy. I ask her why did they change our room and never notify us room changes now that we book their hotel and hoping to share rooms with double beds now we all stuck with sleeping same beds.  her respond was so rude she said exact word to me ""girl this is caesar palce high end hotel we don't change room for people"". and she went on saying how high end the hotel is. Her attitude giving impression to us that they don't care about their guest because they are high end hotel. I was so mad we left it the way how it was and try to do our best to accommodate the room together among ourself.    I will never recommend this hotel to anyone and if we have known before hand we would have book else where.  the bad things was i also gamble at this hotel. but i guess they are so high end that they forget how to train their employee to use friendly attitude.    Since they said their hotel is so high end here is what their high end hotel looks like in the room. Broken bathroom lock scrach paint on wall....so on..."
20,"My stay at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas NV from April 14 till 172022 was a little lackluster. This was primarily because of the 2-hour wait that I had to endure trying to check in. When I arrived to check in there had to be at least 150 people in line and only 4 front desk clerks. 5 of the 8 automated check-in/check-out machines were out of service. When I finally made it to the front of the line I told the front desk clerk about the long wait in line I had experienced and she sort of gave me the brush off by saying ""I don't know why the line's so long I just started "" meaning her work shift. I then asked to speak to the floor supervisor. His attitude was even worse. He blamed the long lines on the Easter weekend and sick calls. Mind you this was a Thursday evening and so what if all these people are here for the Easter weekend which I don't believe. Most of us have a calendar on our cellphone. We know well in advance that Easter is coming up schedule accordingly! The very next day I called the front desk and asked to speak with the hotel manager about the matter. The front desk clerk stated that there wasn't a manager available but that I could make a claim over the phone and that the matter would be addressed. I did. Well the matter remains unaddressed 3 weeks later. This may sound like I'm making a big deal but my stay was only for 3 nights. After check-in during the first night's stay all I was able to do was have dinner and go to bed. If there isn't some sort of cancelation clause in most of the h√¥tel's reservation policy then there should be in a situation such as this. You should be able to cancel the reservation without penalty. Also the staff at Caesars Palace were a bit arrogant they behaved like they were doing you a favor to let you stay there."
30,"Had never stayed here before and been to Vegas quite a few times. We thought ""oh newly renovated rooms let's try it"".  so 4 nights 120000 and for ""only $6.oo a night extra we can get an ""upgrade"".  Overall the only thing nice I have to say is that the bed was perfect.  The room wasn't well appointed and it also was not newly renovated. The sinks dripped so did the shower. The vanity was chipped and worn. The light fixtures and shades were stained. The service overall was horrible from the long lines at check in to the horrible customer service at the spa. Most of the employees were helpful other than front desk staff and the spa staff which was a whole nother nightmare.  I'd gladly stay at the Tropicana the Flamingo Golden Nugget  even Harrahs. This was NOT worth the money and the incredible amount of line waiting. Period. Oh...and zero and I mean ZERO payouts on any machines.  No fun. And won't be back.  Did I mention $14.00 for two bottles of water? Or $20 for k cup coffee?  Good lord. I get it the pandemic was hard on everyone but you didn't have to try and make it all back in 4 days!"
40,I stayed for one night at the hotel and it was great staying there right next to NFL draft ocassion and vibe. A clean room and quiet resting place in comparison to a buzzing and almkst jostling lobby--playing-- area. The hotel is majestic with the buildings flanking each other. It would be more exciting if they allowed early check-in than 4pm though.
30,Very grand entrance very beautiful one of the nicest hotels on the strip by a long ways. Have wanted to stay at Caesars several times and finally had the opportunity. Only bad part from what I understand is Caesars always over books so we did not get the room we originally booked.
40,I got a good deal on a room at Caesars for part of our stay in Vegas. The price was great and the room was beautiful. Furniture and fixtures were getting a bit worn in places but generally very nice.    On our first night there was apparently a power surge in our tower that took out room phones TV wifi and (worst of all) a/c. Because I couldn't use the phone in our room I went down to the lobby intending to just stand in the check-in line. However there were approximately 5000 people already there (lol). I went over to the Security desk and a nice gentleman named Kendall dialed up a nice lady named Veronica for me. She advised what had happened and that they were working on repairs. For our inconvenience two nights of resort fees were comped to us which I felt was more than fair.    The only less than ideal situation during our stay was housekeeping. Our first day I left a $10 tip in the envelope but I guess it wasn't enough? We had hung our used towels up but housekeeping took them away and didn't replace them. The same thing happened the next day at which point we were out of towels. Quite annoying. We had to call housekeeping for more. Other than that all they did was make the bed and empty trash cans. One would expect mirrors/sinks/shower would be wiped at least once in 4 days but not so much.    On our last day there they didn't even bother with our room. We left the make up room light on and there was housekeeping staff in the room right next door when we left around 9 a.m. When we returned just before 5 p.m. our room had not been touched. Again we had to call housekeeping because we were down to a sliver of soap and had take out trash from the night before that we wanted to get rid of. It was kind of disappointing they didn't seem to give a crap about how well or even if our room was cleaned.    Other than that Caesars is a great property and as I said the room was lovely. We'd definitely stay here again and recommend to others.
30,My room located in the Palace tower was beautiful lovely view and comfortable bed. The problem was the entire resort had blasts of foul-smelling gas and noted by many of the people that I spoke with. The conference rooms were well-equipped but the chairs were too close together (actually locked together). The coffee service was good.
10,There was a time when Caesar‚Äôs was one of the best resorts in Vegas. I am sorry to say that was not the case when I was there. They lost part of my reservation having me booked for only half my stay. Fortunately I had the confirmation email. The carpet was peeling up from the floor in the first room I had. After being moved to a new room I couldn‚Äôt get housekeeping even after calling 3 times.  One of my business associates waited in line for 1-1/2 hours only to be told her room wasn‚Äôt ready. It was 4:30pm.  A truly disappointing stay.
50,In Vegas for a conference here at Caesars - what a beautiful place! Eric upgraded my room gave me great directions to the room‚Ä¶be prepared to walk. Worth every step! Clean friendly awesome energy around the casino abut quiet rooms.
10,I was robbed in Caesars casino bar robbed of my wallet and phone. I alerted casino security asked them to review camera footage and they did nothing except alert the front desk who cut off access to my room. Imagine how difficult that makes your life when you have no room money credit cards or phone. I tried to explain it to the front desk and they only cared about me paying the bill. Thank God I was able to find my brother which is not easy without a phone. He was able to put down his credit card. The police do not take robbery crime reports over the weekend which keeps recorded crime rates low. STAY AWAY.
20,We had a room credit and were told after the fact that the tips for room service could not be used. The cost of the amenities were beyond ridiculous and the cost in general for anything in this hotel is insane. A cup of coffee delivered to the room is $24. One cup of coffee. 2 sandwiches; $97. It‚Äôs a joke but your limited of you stay in your hotel.
20,Very disappointed. Caesar‚Äôs needs a big remodel. Service was below average. Some not all employees were rude/uninformed. Room rates and food/beverages way overpriced. Food quality average at best. Would not stay there again.
20,"My partner and I had fond memories of Caesar's from different trips over the years so it was our hotel of choice when returning for a business trip in April 2022. We were really disappointed.    The rooms were old not well maintained and small. The beds need to be replaced (mattresses are bouncing and cheap feeling). The hotel staff was rude especially the registration staff. Granted it's Vegas so staff have to deal with a lot of stressful financial situations and I don't blame them for having boundaries but the motto at Caesars is nowhere near ""let's try to make the customer happy if we can."" Several registration staff we encountered were outright combative before we even asked for anything. (Room cleaning staff was wonderful!) Note: you will be charged for an early check-in even if it's a few minutes before your check-in time.    A different pool was closed every day. One of the main reasons we chose Caesar's was the pool complex so you can imagine the frustration to have a 90 degree day and the big gorgeous main pool closed (for our entire stay!). There's still construction in the lobby now over a year. The casino floor is smoky (to be expected but more than usual) and badly in need of an update. The free lounge chairs at the pool are rearranged in the evening and again in the morning to be farther back from the pool and closer together making the pool deck uncomfortable and quite frankly pretty silly. There are dozens of loungers poolside that no one uses all day long.    Don't get me wrong - we know nothing is free in Vegas. But how Caesar's handles their guests in a post-Covid world was really disappointing. We will not stay here again. We had much more pleasant experiences spending time at Wynn and Planet Hollywood. P.S. Many people told us to book The Venetian instead - they were right."
50,I loved Ceasars! Stayed in the Agustus tower with a fabulous view of the fountains! The room was AWESOME especially that jacuzzi tub. Helped ease the pain of walking all day.  Thanks Kyle Jackson for the late checkout
10,Arrived April 28th to celebrate a personal accomplishment with my girlfriend. Quick and easy express check-in and got a room in the Octavius tower.    Arrived at my room and realized the A/C completely did not work neither did the phone or the TV. As you can imagine no AC in Vegas makes for a pretty sweltering room. We reported it to maintenance and 7 hours later (around midnight) we still had no maintenance update anything.    So I go down to the desk and am greeted by Kevin the antagonist of this story. We explain what is going on and instead of empathy we are immediately combatted with well we gave you that as an upgrade so you can stay and wait for maintenance but they won't come until the morning. As you can imagine I'm immediately take back by this statement.    So I say look Kevin I've just flown in from halfway across the country I'm exhausted I want to be able to sleep. He walks away comes back and says fine but we are taking away the upgrade because it was free anyway so you shouldn't have any problem with it. Firstly no. That's like walking up and offering me a comp dinner and then giving me a bill at the end. You just don't do that I'd expect a room similar to the one I was originally given without knowing if it was a free upgrade or not. So we explain that to Kevin and he scoffs and immediately becomes combatitive again. Mind you this is the middle of the night the last thing I want to do is argue about if an upgrade was free or not it was given to us therefore the expectation is to honor that.    If it was just a TV not working sure whatever at least I had a view of the fountains and Paris and it was gorgeous. But no TV no phone service (which in itself is a huge liability) and no AC? Awful.    And it wasn't just us as during my one wildly unpleasant conversation with Kevin I heard 2 more complain about it as well and an additional 3 couples in the elevators. If you've had this problem since before people Arrived don't put them in a giant liability hazard and give them no AC and call it an upgrade.    Been to vegas 10+ times and this was undoubtedly the worst hotel experience I've ever had.
10,On 4/30 I went to Vista Cocktail lounge. I sat down at the bar and put $ into the slot machine. I waited for about 10 minutes for someone to come and offer me a drink and had no luck. I finally waved a lady over and she quickly asked to see my id which I then handed her my Global Entry Card. The lady flashed a light on it. I continued to play she came over and said ‚Äúwhat is this?‚Äù I replied and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs a Global entry card issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection this is the only form of id ive been using and haven‚Äôt had an issue‚Äù she then said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what that is and I can‚Äôt serve you‚Äù she not once bothered to try asking a manager or supervisor. She gave back my card. And walked away. There was a gentleman sitting next to me and said he couldn‚Äôt believe what he was hearing. The lady then came back and said ‚Äúoh and you also have to leave this place now‚Äù I was in disbelief this was happening. I felt embarrassed and in shock. I cashed out from the slot I was on. Grabbed my ticket and walked out. My friends and husband were right outside waiting for me and I explained what had just happened. I decided to walk back inside and asked the lady if I could speak with a supervisor/manager she said she would text him. 15 minutes later the supervisor came. Without asking me anything He right away said he checked the ‚Äúbook‚Äù and that they did accept that form of id and was there any other questions I had? He was extremely rude. I proceeded to tell him how is it that the lady sees all forms of Id‚Äôs from around the world and does she question every single one of them like she did mine? but sees a US Global entry card and right away refuses service to me? She doesn‚Äôt take the time to ask a supervisor or manager and just tells me ‚ÄúCesar‚Äôs‚Äù does not accept it and tells me to leave. I advised that I felt discriminated in which the supervisor then replied and said I shouldn‚Äôt feel that way because he‚Äôs Hispanic and he does not see the problem because it was not discrimination. I told him if that‚Äôs the way she treats everyone then something is wrong and the supervisor said she is now aware what a Global entry card is. I said ‚ÄúIt would have been better if she would have called you so that you can explain this to her‚Äù which he replied that she did call him and that‚Äôs the reason he‚Äôs there. I told him that she only did that because after I was kicked out by her I decided to come back and ask for a supervisor which he then looked confused. I never got an apology from the supervisor or the lady not 1 apology. If anything I felt like I was being attacked. I wasn‚Äôt offered a Customer Complaint Form either. The only reason I know about a complaint Form is because I explained what had happened to me to a different employee at Caesars and the nice gentleman advised that they should have offered a Customer Complaint Form. I was there to celebrate my Birthday but instead felt Offended and discriminated against and completely helpless. The supervisor/manager's name is Ray. The bartender's name is Sharon. The incident happened maybe around 6:00pm or 7:00 pm on 4/30 at the ‚ÄúVista Cocktail lounge‚Äù
30,Was really excited to stay at Caesars because it‚Äôs such an iconic hotel. But honestly I think one stay was enough for me. First of all the checkin line is a disaster it is so long. I read on here before hand so I knew to expect it. Also there is no concierge or service desk so if you have questions you can try and use their app or wait in the mega line for your question. You can also call from your room but it‚Äôs hit and miss on whether they will answer.    I stayed in the Julius Tower. It was a fine sized room. The bed was comfortable but I could not have been more annoyed that I was put into a room that looked into a wall. Obviously I‚Äôve stayed in city hotels before where you look into other buildings but this wall was five feet away from the window and it covered was covered overtop so I literally had no idea if it was day or night sunny or cloudy. That‚Äôs a literal joke. They said the only way I could get room with sunlight was if I paid an extra $75 a night. Literally no thank you.    The pools are nice but also have a heavily tiered system in terms of which ones you are allowed to use based on what you pay.    Spa was great and had a great relaxing experience and massage!    Honestly there‚Äôs too much chaotic energy here. While it‚Äôs central and mythical it is not worth it to have a room with a window to no where. You are way better off staying at the Bellagio or probably any where else that hired a reputable architect.
10,The facilities are amazing but the service of the majority of the staff was extremely poor. After arriving from a transatlantic flight and queuing for 45 minutes to check in I was told that they could not find my reservation. I showed them the reservation by email but somehow they could not find it. I later checked with my booking provider and they had told them that I had not stayed at the property. After a little research it turns out this is not uncommon at this hotel as they would like to avoid paying booking fees to external providers. All in the all the booking process was not only stressful but lengthy. All together it took over an hour and a half.    My second experience of poor service was at the bar. After ordering a few drinks at the bar they did not arrive I asked another member of the bar staff on the progress of the drinks and the member of bar staff that served the drinks had gone on break and not passed the order on.    My third experience of poor service was at the pool area. It was a lovely day and as there were no sun beds to leave our belongings and use the pool area. One of the waitresses said that we could use a small table at the edge of the vip area as they have no bookings. We were pleased with this. After getting out of the pool we found a manager stood by our belonging being very aggressive asking us to move them or pay $200 to use the vip area. We explained that we had been invited to use the table to which he responded that either move our things or security will be called to remove us from the hotel.    It balance this was only 3 members of staff and the rest were brilliant the hotel was lovely as were the rooms. I have never stayed in 5 star accommodation before and everything about the hotel was 5 star including 5 star prices for all meals and drinks and 5 star facilities. I would expect the service to be 5 stars as well. Unfortunately not.
50,Daniel helped us check in and upgrade three of us to suite and penthouse at no cost. They should have been standard room when I reserved. We really enjoyed our stay at Nobu Hotel in Caesars and will definitely go there again!
50,We had a beautiful suite with a view of the Bellagio fountains. Moses was very helpful at check-in making sure we were well taken care of with the nicest room in the Octavius Tower which has easy access to restaurants. The bed was very comfortable which is always important to me we had two bathrooms a huge full bar with two fridges a very spacious living room. We had an incredibly delicious dinner at Gordan Ramsey's Pub & Grill. I highly recommend the scallops charcuterie beef wellington and sticky toffee pudding. One negative note was Pronto by Giada where we had tasteless salads that were overpriced.
50,This was our fist time staying with Ceasars Palace. I have to say that from the moment you check in until you leave you are treated like family. The staff is absolutely amazing and has to be some of the best people. As a firefighter I know what it's like to deal with the public and the staff here are truly amazing. The hotel and rooms are beautiful. I could have stayed in the hotel without leaving and had plenty to do. This will be the only place we stay from now on.
10,Took over an hour to get through the very short check in line but eventually we made it through and got to our room at 2:00 am. We were tired so I grabbed a water on the counter for hydration and went to sleep. Next morning we got up and left. As we returned to our room that evening we found the AC was not working. After being lied to for hours we were eventually told the ac was out in our entire section and we just had to stick it out. This is when I found out the water I grabbed was a $12.00 water. I ran down to the gift shop and grabbed some cheaper waters ($5.75 each) and wanted to throw them in the fridge...But NOPE; it's $75.00 to use the fridge in the room. To use the coffee pot in the room is $20.00 and then you have to purchase their $6.00 per cup coffee to put in the pot. Then to top it all off we lose internet tv and no ac. All we got from Caesar's Palace was a large bill and a shallow apology
10,Will NEVER stay here again. Worst customer service I've ever had. First reserved room with king bed reservationist verified it was a king. Got to the room it was a queen bed. The room was so old and run down it looked liked something from a creep show. Curtains hanging off hooks counter broken with a piece of plastic over it dirty room smashed bugs on the wall it needed remodeling 10 years ago. Every time I asked for front desk couldn't get anyone to answer. Check-in 3 hours. I checked out over the phone I was told I could would get an email receipt. Never received an email. The check-in process was a nightmare. I still haven't received a receipt despite many inquiries.
30,My husband and I have stayed here before so decided to book again for our 33rd wedding Anniversary.The room we ended up with had a view of the walls of another part of the casino but we didn‚Äôt complain the air conditioning was a little loud as well but we still didn‚Äôt complain after 3 nights of no housekeeping though we did call the front desk to ask for housekeeping and we‚Äôre told they‚Äôd have someone come up no one showed. When checking out we were overcharged so needed to get that corrected and explained about housekeeping not showing up even after we called we were told by the front desk they would speak with management about our bill and see if anything else could be done to compensate us for no house keeping. Our bill was readjusted to the correct charges but nothing more. I was extremely disappointed this trip.
50,I absolutely enjoyed my after birthday trip at Caesars Palace. The hotel room was very clean & I also slept very great on the king bed.The front desk agents management and guests were very polite and helpful. It won‚Äôt be the last time I have a room in Caesars Palace. Thanks for a great night keep up the great work. Caesars Palace the #1 casino in the world!
10,After a wonderful trip in February to this property this past Sunday evening was a nightmare! I had attempted all day to utilize the online check-in as always via their app with no luck. I then tried their website and received the same error. Without much concern I assumed I would be able to utilize their self check-in kiosk. However after arriving I noticed they were all off. I waited approximately 2 hours to get to the front desk to be treated very rude. I asked if they had experienced technical difficulties that day creating such a long wait. I was informed he did not handle any technical issues and it was my problem for arriving at 10:30pm (in Vegas??). It was now past midnight and I was also informed by this same representative that my upgraded fountain view room was useless due to the nfl draft stage built for this week's events. They emailed me on Wednesday after my departure to inform me of road closures. A prior room conflict before arriving would have been appreciated. It was only an overnight trip this time so I asked if I could at least have a delayed check out to help with the less than 11 hours to have the room the response again was that it was my problem and I would need to pay an extra fee. I moved forward due to the time and went to the adjacent hotel lobby bar and could not even receive service for a drink. I moved to another bar with multiple people there and was told they were closing. Very disappointing trip to ruin the finale of our anniversary trip after such a good experience just 2 months ago. I tried calling today to express my concerns and was told too bad.... With the prices of rooms food and drinks at this location service should be better! Very Disappointing!!
30,Well we knew what we were up to so no surprise. The check-in queue was huge and we spent 30min waiting there. You can feel how everything is made to try to squeeze each dollar out of you. At the end of the day rooms were good and clean and that's most important
30,From check in to check out this experience was very disappointing. We paid for an updated room and had to pay unexpected resort fees no robes or access to them no refrigerator in our room for personal use the housekeeper had us call for extra towels when they were right on the cart a keurig in the room with no K-cups staff unfriendly all around no access to the pool after 6pm spa services charged us $596 for one 50 minute facial and now we have to file a discrepancy to get our money back. Front desk could not help and spa services did not answer phone with numerous voice-mails left.
40,We got the room we wanted. It was a fountain view at the Augustus tower. The room was clean. We didn‚Äôt touch the mini bar. They offered daily housekeeping but we refused we asked for clean towels and it was delivered right away. We love the pool. Staff was helpful. I recommend.
20,Arrived and took 1 hour for checking into our room pool bar/bathrooms a mess and under construction paid $300 for our room and was put in worst run down room. Not the experience we had 2 years ago. Staff unfriendly.
10,"I recently stayed at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas Nevada. We were put in the Julius tower. I paid extra for the view of the strip. My ""beautiful view"" was of the nasty roof of the building and a few buildings across the street. When I checked in I was disrespected because my bank thought it was a fraudulent charge and locked my account. After having eyes rolled at me and dismissed as some loser I was finally checked in. I asked about accommodations for my son's birthday and there were none. The concierge service doesn't exist. Half the restaurants were closed. The Starbucks was out of products.    My room was atrocious. The carpet was disgusting. Old and stained. There was mold in the corner. There was mold and an inch thick covering of dust inside a lamp. I was not allowed to use the refrigerator to store my insulin without being charged a fee. I had to use the sink filled with ice. I was charged all kinds of fees for merely opening the fridge and inspecting the products in it to see if I even wanted to drink them.  My friends stayed in a separate tower paid less and the room was way nicer. (Although the tub was dirty upon her arriving in the room.)  I did complain to staff when all this happened. I was told nothing could be done without having to pay upgrade fees.    This was supposed to be a 5 star hotel. I'd give it 1 star. Over priced out of stock and filthy!! Yes I have reached out to the hotel. They do not answer any negative mail."
20,Was stood in check in Queue for ages to then have my card blocked when trying to pay an additional pre authorisation fee I had go despite paying for room etc before arrival. Couldn‚Äôt contact bank and staff did not want to help what so ever just left me stood there unable to check in despite me offering to pay using other methods. Huge Queues and bad staff service all round through my stay.. would choose to stay elsewhere next time. Rooms and pool very good.
30,On day one we waited a while in checkin paying $60 for early status. Worth it. Immediately changed and went to the pool seeking early spring sunshine. There were no available seats in the one open and when I inquired I was told I could not rent any. No reason or alternative given. We squeezed in front of a daybed and sat next to empty cups and cans enjoying the sun for about 40 minutes.    Room was great nice big bathroom lots of space.    Coffee in room was four pods for $20.99. We walked downstairs to the cafe. Speaking of walking Caesar is always a hike to anywhere but construction zones seemed to move overnight making navigation terrible. It was when we were leaving that I noticed what looked to be a very useful app to find your room. We spent 30 minutes each night trying to find ours feet aching.    The spa was ok. Found a giant wad of hair in the hot tub one section was closed for repairs. Massage fine though she was a talker.    We were strongly encouraged to not need housekeeping but to text if we needed anything. We needed the room cleaned by the third day and new towels. Returned with a clean room and a big bag of towels on the floor in the hallway.    I always stay here because it's in the center of the strip but I think I'd prefer a hike from a smaller less spread out property. Walking to the pool to coffee to the room to the taxi stand to the uber location to the spa I walked 14+ miles the first day.
10,My friend and I each had Augustus Executive Suites at $650 a night for each suite. Check in was a jok - room was ready later in the day.staff clearly does not want to work there No bathrobes in the roolm (in a suite). Coffee was a charge. Room service was nonexistent...after two hours of attempts to order it was delivered in a to go bag. This place was beyond a joke and very poorly mismanaged. The only reason I gave it one star is because the spa was wonderful and Amalfi Hells Kitchen and the Steak House all were great restaurants. The hotel itself is a joke and I would absolutely never stay there again and stay clear ungtil they change their ways.
30,The hotel room was filthy one of the lights did not work and the maintenance crew started blowing down at the pool at 6am which I could hear on the 15th floor. The french bakery had the worst croissant I have ever had and a drip coffee (espresso machine was broken) and a croissant was almost $15. The casino area was under construction so it was a little difficult to see past all the temporary drapes.
40,I have always loved Caesars. It's Las Vegas. Basically you are on your own though. I just got the sense that Caesars has gone on the cheap these days and you just don't get the luxury feel of days gone by. And yes I am a little spoiled because I have had lovelier experiences there over the last 30 years even when I lost money gambling which I did not this time. Sign of the times I guess. More cons this time than I have ever had unfortunately They do not communicate well with their guests. We were not advised of the construction going on which caused a lot of pushing and shoving amongst people. I felt sad for the handicapped and wheelchair guests. We were not advised the pool would be closing early for a private party so we could have planned our day. We were asked to leave at 4:30 after having only arrived at 4:00 They did comp a night's resort fee for the inconvenience after having talked to 3 people but still it's one of the things I look most forward to and did not get. The food court only had a couple of the restaurants open so it was slim pickins'. We did however get to enjoy the Gordon Ramsay restaurant. Excellent. The service people were kind and friendly. Also I asked for a fountain view but was told I had not gambled enough so we got a view of the building wall next door. So I would maybe still stay there and it is still worth visiting because of the style location and the Augustus tower.
20,We were extremely disappointed in the condition of the room. Our head board was made of some leather and it was peeling. All the furniture in the room was scuffed and showing extreme wear and tear. The bathroom cabinet was missing most of the molding and the old glue was still visible on the mirror. The hair dryer did not work. Finally Caesars provides a coffee maker but no coffee pods. If you want coffee you need to buy it from the mini bar selection. Overall disappointed in this hotel.
20,The hotel is beautiful as to be expected. But I did not expect all the furniture to look rundown in our room. We had a beautiful view of the Bellagio Fountain but the room was not very clean. There was dust on the tables the phone was sticky. The headboard on our bed was made of some fake leather material which was peeling. The marble bathroom was beautiful but the cabinet was falling apart. Parts of the mouldings were broken or had fallen off and the paint on the wood was all chipped. For the price I paid for the room we were very disapointed in the condition of the furnishings. Also disappointing that Caesars provides an in room Keurig coffee maker but charges you for the coffee pods. Coffee is part of the minibar and its overpriced.
50,Associate Tangela made my checkin in process so smooth and at ease giving me and my boyfriend the most superb customer service in adjusting my stay another night longer at the best rates ! Plus she was super friendly and very inviting exactly what you need for your first encounter upon entrance.
50,We arrived at the hotel during a busy Check-In process. We were assisted by Eric in the Diamond Registration area. Eric was awesome! He was efficient full of helpful information - great personality and left such a great first impression of the hotel!!
20,Staying at Caesar‚Äôs used to be so nice however they don‚Äôt have room service any longer. You have a piss poor selection of restaurants with limited selections that deliver to your room. Not to mention all the nickel and dining that Caesar‚Äôs does from charging $10 for a wine glass to be delivered to your room or $80 for using their in room fridge for personal items. It‚Äôs ridiculous we got married here in 2017 and they still blame it on COVID in May of 2022. I won‚Äôt be returning to this Casino.
20,It looks great online but did not live up to expectations. At check-in there was a notice saying Upgrades were available. I know what level I booked and I ended up receiving the same category of room. I was told that I would receive a newly remodeled upgrade and instead I got an older room with carpet that was frayed ceiling stained poor lighting and air conditioning that did not work well.  *The worst part was that I had booked two chairs at the Venus pool--when we arrived there was a freak of nature storm with 40 mph winds 65-70 temp and it began to rain about 1 hour after we arrived. We attempted to stick it out ordered drinks but after about an 1.5 hours we were absolutely freezing. The staff at the Venus pool (Eric and our server) were THE BEST PART OF OUR STAY-they made us laugh and brought us warm towels. When I asked at the very front pool desk manager about transferring our reservation to the next day I was told that I had to pay the difference about $50 per chair and they could not offer anything else. A poor excuse for customer service considering it was horrible weather that was causing me to reschedule.  *We returned back from a dinner out and the casino entrance looked like an angry mob had come through. There was trash and several areas were covered in vomit.  * This is what I expect of a low-end hotel not a higher Price point resort. I expect exceptional customer service and at the very least clean and good working order facilities from all resorts that are attempting to create relationships and return customers. I WAS DISAPPOINTED BY ALMOST EVERY ASPECT OF THIS RESORT.
10,The room is not clean  lot of dust. The mattress and pillows are pathetic. Staffs are all rude. Very bad experience and never will go that place again. Overrated for a bare minimum quality. Done with Caesar  never anymore
20,So first off the employee at the check in desk was rude and hit us with $600 in surprise fees. When challenged on the fees she went and contacted an even more rude manager who was not helpful at all. The room reeked of marijuana and the hotel was under construction. The hotel wan not helpful or accommodating for our friends trying to send gifts to our room for our wedding. Overall bad experience and will not stay at another Caesar‚Äôs property.
40,This is our second time staying at Caesars Palace. Room was great but shower was not strong enough. They upgraded our room free of charge in the Octavia tower but it was far from the main are-but close to the pool. We found the casino table we‚Äôre always pricey even during low times. The pools were busy and had to get there early to get spots. Not sure why all the pools were not opened? Overall it was a great time in Vegas!
50,Great 4 night stay. Forum Tower Classic Suite. Great room close to casino shops food court.  Very busy during the week can't imagine weekends. Prices are double for food/drinks than at home. Close walking distance to center of strip. Great pool day w/ canopy. Will be back
50,We always have a wonderful stay at Caesars Palace! Caesar's awards is always top notch with all they offer and recommendations while there! Love the Pre-Check in convenience and check out as well!  Thank you.
20,We have stayed at a number of 5 star hotels around the world and this would have to be one of the worst. The money it cost us for 2 days was out of this world. There was no guest guide in the room the price of drinks in the mini bar we ridiculously expensive the noise from the air conditioning units on the roof of the forum shops was so loud that it felt like it was in our room and we were on the 38th floor. I will never stay there again
30,Caesars Palace is beautiful but they don't seem to care about their customers. It's Spring Break week for many and they decide to close two pools; one being the most beautiful pool the Temple Pool. The pool area was packed and if you didn't get to the pool by 9:15 am you could not find a chair. The chairs were packed together like a cruise ship. Resort fees were over $50 and not reduced due to this inconvenience.Our room was very pretty but lacked care. The carpet and sofa was stained and dirty. There were also very few options to get breakfast or lunch. Most of the food court was closed. Lines were ridiculously long for a quick coffee. And to top it off a lack of management is not present. On a very windy day a huge piece of metal (at least 5 ft. X 5 ft.) came flying off the very top of one of the towers. It appeared to be from an air-conditioning unit. It came within 10 feet of a woman on a lounge chair. The life guard notified a pool attendant and he asked us what we had seen. Then he said he would contact management. After over an hour no one came to check on this situation. This could have been deadly to not only the lady sitting in the lounge chair but others if another piece of metal broke off the building.  It appears that Caesars cares about one thing....Making money!
20,We arrived early ready for a awesome experience in the biggest beautiful hotel in Las Vegas. I payed $55 early check inn just to get to a room that‚Äôs old and outdated. Looked like I was at a motel 6. The furniture was all scratched up and damaged. The carpet was a mess and dirty. My shower had a huge clump of hair over the drain and also the sink was clogged and wouldn‚Äôt drain water out. We then have housekeeping management come up an check and she takes pictures and ask if we would like to switch rooms. ‚ÄúYes‚Äù so we go back to the front desk. Wait in line this time for 45 min then had to pay $250 more to switch to a better room. We should have been compt to a better room. So we get new room which was nice until our last nite there we used room service late to get a pizza. And the pizza place called me on my cellphone and asked what hotel I was staying in? I had already done everything online with hotel room number my cellphone number and all that. The later proceeds to tell me that I‚Äôm not showing in the system that I had a room at 2015 which was the room they moved me too. So she said they would have to cancel the order. So we walk down stairs to the restaurant Dafaria‚Äùs pizza and they close at 11 pm I ordered at 10:25 we get the call at 10:55 we walk down there and can only buy a slice when we ordered a whole pie and 2 salads. So we ended up with 2 slices and going to bed hungry. Thanks to Caesar‚Äôs Palace. Want stay again very dissatisfied.
50,I requested and upgrade to the Caesar's Tower paid extra but loved the view of the pools and the mountains room was spacious with an awesome bathroom I brought my own coffee because I am snub and will not pay extra for it rooms were clean and opted for no service the fitness center was clean and good amount of equipment with an attendant on site. Pools were great with awesome drink and food service
20,I've been a big fan of Caesar's for a long time but never actually stayed there. I have to say I was deeply disappointed. Even the Keurig pods in the room weren't free. There was no hair dryer. We had a massive stain on the tile in the entryway of the room. The tv barely worked the jets in the tub did not work the Temple Pool was closed (even though the other less fun pools were open) as was the Venus Pool and it is no longer European style bathing. Caesar's mobile website is absolutely terrible- online it says they do a night swim at Venus Pool Thurs-Sun and I was there Sunday night- nobody at the pool. If you go to their mobile calendar it says there was supposed to be a night swim on 4/17 so I couldn't understand it. Temple Pool is the biggest pool and since it was closed there was much less seating available and I had to fight to get a chair at 11am! When you call the front desk you get a recording suggesting you text instead- no I'd like to speak to a human and not have to listen to a recorded message before doing so. When I did get in touch with guest services the guy was unable to give me any information regarding the cost of renting a cabana or nicer pool chair. He suggested I go online (which again does not work) or speak to the pool check in person. I went to get my towels and asked the girl about the cost of a chair- she couldn't tell me either I'd have to find yet another person who could even just give me a price! The lobby was also under massive construction and my favorite bar Cleopatra's Barge was closed. If I had paid less money it would have been fine but the room was dated and the amenities were none. I will not be staying at Caesar's again unfortunately.
50,Thanks Eric for the wonderful check in experience and the beautiful room! Everything was perfect! The room was clean and had a beautiful view of the Bellagio Fountains and the strip. We really enjoyed the buffet at the hotel as well.
30,Room service was Uber Eats/ Doordash general store closed randomly due to no staff poor dining choices- many restaurants closed all day and most other as closed early with limited menus. No poolside food options. Could only use Uber or Lyft at one designated rideshare location on property that was a far walk. Hurt my foot during trip and hotel had no wheelchairs available for rent/use and directed me to a third party company that had terrible reviews. Shower and sink drains both broken and filled up in room. Overall very disappointed and would never ever stay at Caesars again. I even paid $50 extra each day for an upgraded room. 3 of the 5 pools closed due to lack of staff all guests limited to 2 small pools and not enough chairs for any of us yo use or sit on. Waste of money.
10,I recently stayed here for a work trip and decided on doing the upgraded room for a jetted tub and better view for 50 bucks a night. The view was better but the tub sadly didnt work. I was content with the view though and decided no problem things happen. So my first night Sunday I try and connect to the WiFi and nothing. It shows a speed of less than 1 mbps which is super super slow. I called the front desk and they connected me to tech support who could not help but said they would put a work order to look at routers in 24 hours. At this point I head to a coworkers room in Julius tower to do work for conferance the next day since I have no WiFi. So I waited 24 hours and called back the next night and they told me that they will look into it soon so I spent yet another night over in Julius tower in coworkers room doing my work for conference the next morning. So Tuesday after the conference I head back to the room to drop my stuff off and I figured I would check to see if it works. No go so I head to the front desk and they call a manager who informs me he is sorry but their is nothing they can do except maybe move me rooms the next day. My only issue with that is I start work at 730am and new rooms wont be ready until 11 or 12 so I cant move rooms. I make another call to tech support and they told me sorry and to check on getting part of the room refunded due to this issue. I figured ok A place like this will make it right since it seemed like everyone from the manager front desk and tech support was on my side I just went along. Last but not least my wifes phone was stolen on the second to last night of the trip from her pocket as she was playing the casino. A police report was made the next day but their security did not seem to be that concerned. We had let them know 5 minutes after it occured as we figured they would be able to look at their cameras because she was bumped into but I guess it wasnt that important to them. All in all it was a good view but other than that it was a nightmare and I will be sure to tell my company that next year we need to look at another property in beautiful Las Vegas.
40,I stayed at this hotel for business. The standard rooms are big and nice. The closet was also big enough for my 5 day business attire. There are many restaurants and food options in hotel for all budgets. Meeting spaces are great and service during the meeting days was very good but not great. I didn't have to wait in long lines for check in or check out as had some perks due to our corporate meetings but if you are a regular tourist visitor with no Diamond status expect long lines for check in and check out. Some things to consider is that the water and mini bar items are expensive so plan on getting snacks and items from a near by Walgreens if you are on a budget and traveling as tourist with teens. If you want to eat at any of the onsite restaurants reservations are a must way in advance as restaurants get booked pretty quickly. Overall I had a great stay but maybe my review would be different if I had visited as a tourist as opposed to business. We had a decent corporate hotel during the week of April 11 2022. Normal hotel rates vary significantly depending on the days. I had to check in to another hotel that weekend as the rates almost tripled. Check out my other review - stayed the weekend at the Venetian.
20,"Our first impression of Caesar's Palace was a bloody bathroom floor. Our ""upgraded"" room floor was covered in dried blood. We called house keeping and asked someone to come mop it up while we were out. When we returned to our room hours later the blood was still there and when we inquired why house keeping hadn't been by they told us they couldn't find any blood. We asked for them to send someone so we could show them exactly where the blood was. The worker was friendly and scrubbed each spot of blood we showed her. She mentioned how unsanitary and disgusting this was. I waited in line at the front desk to talk to management and they said the best compensation they could do was pay for our room fees for one night (50 USD).    The next day after house keeping came by we found our phone chargers smashed into the wall by the nightstands. So we were comped 50 USD for a bloody floor but now we both have to buy new phone chargers (>50 USD) that were destroyed.    We also rented a cabana during our stay and while everything there was wonderful it's clear that corners are being cut. Before COVID you felt like royalty with the perks and attention. Now it's clear they're under-staffed and struggling to keep up with the demand of all the guests.    I'm hoping our experience was a one-off and not everyone that checks in at Caesar's Palace has to deal with dried blood in their hotel room and has to buy new phone chargers. COVID hit the travel industry hard but blood on the floor is unacceptable."
20,Stayed here for a convention and here‚Äôs the problems. Checking in was slow with a long line that had a diamond status line that kept going first to make it frustrating. The self check in kiosks didn‚Äôt seem to work and we weren‚Äôt provided a bar code which you need to use them. No one used them probably for that reason. After an hour of waiting we were given a room key to a room and someone else was staying in it. The inner lock was deployed but my key worked and partially opened the door on some poor guest awakened at 1:00 am. I called and the customer service said to just go straight to the desk and skip the line which I did and then people in line came up and harassed me about doing so. Good grief. Our room was 2 queens and not a king like we ordered. They said it was an upgrade to a better view. It was a nice view of the pool from 14 floors and it was nice. However each day at 6:30 am they would run multiple gas powered leaf blowers that sounded like chainsaws. Just so you know what to expect. I would definitely make sure that you get a bar code for self check in and maybe not plan on sleeping in if you are poolside. Thanks for reading hope this helps.
40,This was our first visit to Caesars Palace and our first visit to Las Vegas. We were celebrating a big wedding anniversary. Check in didn't take too long. There was a room available at the time we were in the line which was 10:30 am so we opted to pay the 60.00 early check in fee to go ahead to the room. Our room was in the Octavius Tower. Room was very nice. The room and the bathroom was very clean. We had a slight view of the Bellagio water fountain which was very nice. Bed slept good and pillows were good. We didn't touch the mini bar as everything was so pricey. It was a pretty long walk to our room each time we went out. We had a reservation at the buffet our first night. This was the worst meal we had the whole time. Food wasn't that good but also the people in line were very rude. We didn't try another buffet while we were there. The rest of our meals were great. The Old Homestead Steakhouse was delicious. Being our first visit to CP and to LV we learned a lot and even though our room was nice and clean we would stay at a little smaller resort next time. Caesars Palace is a very big and very busy resort. It is a beautiful resort though.
20,My girlfriend and I checked in on a Friday to an employee with horrible customer service skills(giving attitude I think her name was Zandra but can‚Äôt remember) initially charged us an early check in fee less than two hours prior to check in time. I understand if we get there in the morning but two hours prior when the room is ready?? I reluctantly agreed as my girlfriend was exhausted from travel. We get to our room and there is a half drank Fiji water which I called and they made note but still charged me for a water I never drank. Then our bathroom started making noises and my girlfriend walks into a sink full of black water. We call and let concierge know of the issue and they send an engineer. So now what is suppose to be a nice weekend getaway we have an engineer doing maintenance for an hour or so in our bathroom. We were there for three nights and we didn‚Äôt get housekeeping in our room once so a bunch of food and beverage trash built up. We made sure we were out of our room for at least six hours in morning and early afternoon to give them a light image chance to clean the room. And again they charged me for a water I never drank and if somebody did their job whether that‚Äôs housekeeping or they say they have staff that specifically fills the wet bar I wouldn‚Äôt have to see a charge for 11.91. Such disrespect. Maybe you don‚Äôt have issues on your trip but why take the chance on what is suppose to be a nice worry free getaway. My whole trip was wondering what disappointment I would receive next from this hotel.
50,We ended up getting upgraded to the Nobu deluxe king room and the room was beautiful. It was quiet for sleeping and the location was so close to parts of the strip we spent most our time at. It was a great stay
20,Never felt so ripped off in my life. 11.00 for a bottle of water 98.00 for a pizza and salad for room service‚Ä¶. I could go on and on. The staff in the Americano was very friendly and this was our go to for most meals that were somewhat reasonably priced.  I will have to say our room was very clean and quiet. I would definitely stay somewhere else if we go back to Vegas.
50,The only issue I had was with the hotel housekeeping he just walked in an I paid for late hotel check out an he was trying to make us leave early. It was not okay for someone to walk in an I paid for a delayed check out ! Other thank that the hotel was amazing overall !
20,"Rooms are ok. Some bad shower water pressure bath tub leaking but I'll focus here on the finances. I'm paying them a lot if money then come the price hikes while I'm there. $9 pizza slice at the good court internet in the room only for 2 devices - we are 3 people in the room each with at least one device.    Room service for pricy breakfast adds $13  Lots of examples.    I don't think they care about one person's feedback but I hope now people join to tell these ""resorts"" to reconsider their ""maximizing profits"" policy.    If they continue this may have been my last visit to Vegas."
50,Amazing hotel! Staff was beyond helpful. Shout out to Joshua Lynds for helping out with our stay. Will be out goto spot for any future trips. Met every expectation for our Vegas spring break vacation.
10,My family and I had a horrible experience at Caesars. It was bad from beginning to end.  We arrived in the late morning and asked if we could check in early. We were actually laughed at. The woman behind the reception counter laughed and said ‚ÄúToo early. No rooms are ready‚Äù. Ok we waited. Finally at about 3:00 a room became available on the app for a $55 fee. Fine. We used the check in kiosk to get our room keys and trekked about 10 minutes to our Octavius Premium room. Our keys didn‚Äôt work. We asked a nearby housekeeper if she could call someone to get us new keys but she told us to use the phone near the elevator to call security. We waited they never came. I went and got the correct keys myself when I waited back in line at reception. All of this trouble took almost an hour so I also got my $55 refunded or so I was told.  We finally got into the room and it was horrible. Everything was dented scratched or torn. The headboards were disgusting. Just horrible. When we checked out and our bill was presented to us we were charged the $55 fee again! The same thing happened last time we stayed at Caesars. That time 2 different bills were presented to us before the correct one as if we were going to fall for the more expensive incorrect one! It so felt shady. A real disappointment.
50,Eric was so helpful at the front desk. Helped me out tremendously! Gave me an incredible upgrade to a huge studio suite with a smooth speedy process and had a great attitude throughout!!!!! Thanks again!!!
30,Average hotel in the middle of the strip. Check in experience took 2 hours which is completely unacceptable. We were told our rooms would be close to each other and they were not. Don‚Äôt bother calling housekeeping. They‚Äôll just ignore you.
10,Not sure how I can speak to 3 level of mngt and never get my room clean after staying 3 nights and having to throw my own trash. Not to mention my room being dirty ( with pubic hair in the bathroom) and several lights not working. We stayed on  Octavios End. Not to mention they repeatedly said someone would come clean and never showed up and they would comp my rooms and deduct the resort fee to only find out they still charged me. So now I‚Äôm calling and having issues with them again.
10,After having stayed in a suite for 4 days which is the size of a small apartment at Caesar‚Äôs Palace I was mortified to see that I was charged $23 for Keurig coffee pods with powdered cream and a half a pack of sugar $20 for cheese crackers $45 for a bagel delivered to my room $15 for a bottle of water and they also wanted to charge me for a certain program I wanted to run on the bicycle in the fitness center. No robes in the room no Q tips nothing provided even in the suites. You get free coffee and a pastry at Motel 6! What a rip off this place is. Next time I go to Vegas I will stay at Aria or the Cosmopolitan. Ceasar‚Äôs is a joke! It used to be better before it was bought out in 2020.
50,We had excellent service at VIP check-in with Eric. He went the extra mile to get us the best room close to elevator and with a great view. We only stay at Caesars due to the excellent service and staff.
10,I stayed at Caesars Palace for ten days in April. I was looking forward to it given its reputation. On the outside we got what we expected - a really nice looking hotel. However everything ended there. At check in we were just a number - no welcome information no help with luggage and the check in staff were not interested at all.  We upgraded to an Augustus tower room and I have to say I was not impressed. After dragging our suitcase for a good ten minute walk I found a dated dark and dingy room with a view Looking over a noisy road. The bathroom was dated. There was a minibar but you were not allowed to put any of your things in it. If you needed to keep Medication cold for example or wanted to store a bottle of water there was a charge of 75. There was no welcome water  Or coffees.  If you wanted a small Bottle of water the charge was 12 dollars and if you wanted a bag of nuts it was about 22 dollars. There was a coffee machine but you had to pay to use it.  I chose the room as it was close to the pools. However this was pointless as all the pool entrances had been closed meaning you could only access  Via one entrance. This meant at least a ten to fifteen minute walk just to the pool. When you got there there was along queue as the pool did not open until 9am and then closed  Promptly at 6. Half of the pools were closed - so I am not sure what the extortionate resort fee charge was for. Additionally on entry to the  Pool all bags are checked to  Prevent you taking any drinks in which I feel is very invasive. If you did want a drink two CANS of beer were  Over ¬£20!!!!!!!  I have stayed in Las Vegas before and I enjoyed the hotel atmosphere in a hotel  Located at the end of the strip (Tropicana) and this was a far superior hotel in my opinion. Caesars Palace sole intention is to screw its guests for as much money as it can.  A hotel that has a good management structure will have staff that endeavour to respond to reviews. I think the attitude of its management is adequately reflected by the fact that they only respond on Tripadvisor to good reviews and apparently ignore all the others.    I have stayed in luxury hotels all over the world and Caesars Palace is a dire dark dirty hotel  That lives on its reputation. It screws it‚Äôs customers at every opportunity and this will eventually catch up with it.  STAY AWAY and save your money!!!
40,We decided to celebrate our milestone anniversary in Vegas which is where we got married. Chose Caesars Palace because Adele was supposed to be there and I was on the waitlist for tickets. We all know how that worked out but since we had such a great rate through Tripadvisor/Hotels.com we kept the reservation.    I'll admit to being concerned after reading a host of negative reviews prior to our departure but at that point it was too late to make a change without shelling out significantly more money so we hoped for the best. And really we had nothing to worry about.    We self parked and getting in/out of the garage was super easy. Short line at check-in and Sam was terrific. I asked about an upgrade as we had originally booked a king room in the Julius Tower and he offered us a very reasonably priced upgrade to the Palace Tower which is closer to the parking garage.    Room was spacious clean and had a great view of the pool area. We knew better than to touch the mini bar and were lucky that someone left a small plug in cooler type of fridge in the room so we used it to store our water.    The were only two items that stood out to me: wish there had been more bath towels as we had declined housekeeping and they need to have a lighted magnifying makeup mirror in these rooms as the bathroom lighting is a bit dim.    Everything else was fine - we were prepared for the walk as the resort is huge and did just fine finding places to eat when we couldn't get reservations at the hotel restaurants. We called down to the front desk to check out and they emailed me the bill right away. No unexpected charges have appeared so everything was as it should be.
20,Awful reception where a couple and daughter were assigned to two different buildings then 2 different floors in same building. No cola vending machines in building (Only ice machines)  . No refrigerator in room (only mini bar) Wonderful for alcoholics and hotel revenue but SUCKS for people (ordinary regular folks who don't drink alcohol)and want to keep some items in a refrigerator during their stay.
20,The checking in line was so long took over one hour to check in. The manager should have opened more windows to check in. Each room only allowed two devices to use WiFi. If you have two people stay in one room and one person logged into WiFi on both his phone and iPad the other person had to pay $19.99 to use WiFi per device. What a scam!
50,Concierge wasn‚Äôt available throughout our stay which would expect there to be one at this price point. Great location outstanding buffet great housekeeping bell service valet was outstanding. Took advantage of the spa services which were excellent. Overall a great trip!
20,Went to Vegas for our 10 year anniversary. First time there and Caesars was quite a disappointment. Check is was fairly easy with the self check in. Paid for the upgraded Augustus room with a fountain view. View was very nice but the room was not. The view of the fountains came at a price of terrible traffic noise all night long. Most of the furniture was very beat up and what Id expect from a side of the highway hotel. Bed was comfortable but the pillows are awful! They are feather filled and nothing worse then getting poked in the head by sharp points all night. The mini bar is a joke with the prices they charge supposedly its all weighted so they know right away if you take a $10 candy bar. How do they possibly think people will pay that $300+ a night they could give you some snacks. They charge $75 if you try to use the mini fridge for your own stuff. Bathroom was large but again a let down. The grout that used to be white is black trim is chipped and broken the front of the tub was falling off. Some nasty green residue on the wall and floor. Online (and confirmed when I called to book) the fountain view rooms are supposed to have a tv in the bathroom it was missing same with the alarm clock. Brought all these issues to the desk manager who said due to many items getting broken they are removing all bathroom tvs and alarm clocks also said shed send maintenance up to fix the tub and clean up. It never happened. Now the resort fee which are a joke the wifi never worked in our room had to go to the lobby to get it to connect and even then never got better then 5mbps. Pools looked nice for the couple that were open but it was a Long walk from our room as all the closer pool entrances were closed. Casino was okay good selection hostesses were nice. Will definitely look elsewhere next time we are in town as Caesars lacks compared to other casinos.
50,This was my first time staying at Caesar‚Äôs Palace and it truly exceeded my expectations. Eric at the Diamond & Seven Stars check-in truly elevated the experience and my initial impression. He was so courteous and thoughtful about providing helpful information. It really set the tone for our trip.    The hotel is very clean and has a lot of great food options. We ate at Gordon Ramsay‚Äôs Pub for lunch and Nobu for dinner ‚Äî both were excellent! I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to eat at either restaurant again. I‚Äôm looking forward to trying Amalfi next time.    Lastly the pool. We went out around 10:30am to snag chairs. It was probably 1/2 full by that time so we were able to get seats in an area that we wanted. Everything was great but only wish the pool menu had more to offer. Lots of drinks but lacking on the food options. However the waitresses at the pool we‚Äôre so sweet!    Honestly all of the staff we encountered at Caesars from Anthony at parking our waiter at the Pub Eric at checkin and the poolside waitresses were all top notch. Can‚Äôt wait to go back!
40,The only reason we ended up in LV for 3 nights was because of the rates i was able to secure from the Caesars Rewards program. I booked Julius tower for Monday - Thursday stay and upgraded to Augustus tower very cheaply closer my stay became. The Caesars app lets you check-in and out which i only appreciated when i saw the front desk line WOW. There was always a line but using the kiosk and talking to the kiosk attendant near the self-park let me check in early and i suspect he hooked me up with a better viewing room then I was slated for. If you self-park have the gate put on your room key and pay the $18 per day on your room. I don't qualify for free parking yet but never having to deal with a parking pay machine was fantastic.  We used the Salon QUA and was happy with the service BUT calling ahead or booking online didn't work. We made our appointment the day before we wanted it and was able to tell the salon what she was looking for and they made it happen. Caesars is very big and when you get a hotel employee in front of you they rock. Calling ahead of a reservation and from the room wasn't great you get routed to a central switchboard somewhere and it's not a good FAQ resource. Best tips on staying include; drop off your bags at front entrance and have them brought up to room after you get there carrying your bags from self-park is dumb and worth a couple tips to not haul my stuff up. The buffet is famous and popular so i made reservations used my rewards number and still told to wait in the general long line of off-the-strip tourists. The buffet was an dis-organized s*&^-show which is really disappointing because it's $89 per person. I left the line and was stuck at 7:30 with no reservations anywhere else and unwilling to prowl the strip for a semi-quiet table with no waiting. We had plans to gamble some and ride the wheel after dinner but ended up back in the nice room watching the Bellagio fountains. The silver lining for me was the buffet hassle saved me around $500 in food drinks and gambling i was prepared to spend that night. I will return and lessons learned make back-up reservations and skip the over-priced over-hyped aspect of the property.
10,"Room was filthy and stunk of pot. Headboard looked like someone took a knife and fork to it trim falling off of the cabinets sink didn't drain and the carpet could not be cleaned it needs to be replaced. When I called to ask for another room the ""manager"" said they didn't have any but the website still showed availability. Despite me asking multiple times the attitude was they just didn't care.    Will never ever ever stay at this property again.    Not my first trip to Vegas been there about 60 times  go stay somewhere else."
40,We stayed in Ceasers Palace for 2 nights during our stay in Las Vegas in April. The check-in was good (at 6:30 pm) and not too many people at the check-in. Maybe it was the time of the check-in.    The location for Ceasers Palace is awesome on the Strip. There are many eating options food court casino and forum mall attached to it. The Hell's kitchen is right outside Ceasers. We could not eat there as we couldn't get reservations.    During our stay there were some renovations going on and a part of the lobby was barricaded. This meant a little bit of a navigating that area but not too bad.    Ceasers Palace has about 5 towers. We had a room on the 26th floor on the Palace tower overlooking the swimming pools (the farthest tower). The room was clean and the view was good too....but the Palace tower is a good 6-8 mins walk from the lobby. This was exhausting every time we wanted to step out to the strip.    The room does not include anything... there is a coffee machine but no coffee... you have to buy the coffee pods to use it in the room.    The hotel has parking for $18 per night.
40,We were expecting a step above most of the other hotels on the strip‚Ä¶ and Ceasers stumbled a bit. The basic room was ordinary the hotel was dirty in a number of places and the staff were friendly but didn‚Äôt show much appreciation to us.    Compared to the Lynq Ceasers isn‚Äôt worth the extra room fees. Compared to Bally‚Äôs it‚Äôs a step above although four steps above in price. Compared to Harrahs the rooms are comparable since they renovated Harrahs.    Overall it won‚Äôt be our first choice‚Ä¶ the value just isn‚Äôt there for the money and cleanliness isn‚Äôt what it used to be.
20,Whilst this hotel undoubtably has beautiful architecture and probably is the best hotel for that in Las Vegas it is an absolute rip-off. Everything boils down to money and they try to get as much out of you as they can which really affects one‚Äôs enjoyment of the place. Two beers round the pool came to ¬£22. A medium bottle of water came to just under ¬£5. For 10 days we had to pay a ¬£400 resort tax however half the pools were closed so I don‚Äôt know what that‚Äôs for. Worst of all if you want to put anything in the room fridge and indeed even if you open the door you have to pay $75 per week for the Priviledge. It is one of the most expensive hotels on the strip and there is a coffee maker in the room but no coffee. We upgraded our room slightly and whilst it was large considering it was at Caesar‚Äôs Palace and the price they charge it was a bit dated and in need of upgrading. I have had better bathrooms in Egypt . On a positive note the Bacharal buffet was excellent although pricey. And actually I think that is the only positive thing I can think of apart from the weather. I Would not go back to Caesars Palace ever. If you are travelling to Vegas you are better staying slightly off strip at maybe a less well-known hotel.    We ate mostly at the Tropicana where instead of paying $13 for a beer we paid $6 in happy hour and $7 normally. It was a quieter hotel and much more friendly. Personally I was not keen on Las Vegas in its entirety but that is probably just me. It was too busy too noisy and too consumptive. I would rather be on a beach in the Maldives which we could have afforded for the price we paid for this place.    We did see some shows. The Blue Man Group were excellent percussionists but not very funny. We saw puppetry of the penis which quite frankly was weird. MJLive at the Tropicana was excellent as was Gregory Popovitch‚Äôs animal show although this is probably more aimed at children.    Frankly I would rather have gone to Benidorm for a fraction of the price.
40,Please make sure to check out at the front as we left told ok not to turn in keys. the self check out machine at the elevators not working at 6 am. So left for the flight. 2 wks later got overcharged for late checkout and food we did not eat. by the way 3 Keurig cups is 22.00 so we went block down and bought our own at CVS. billings never calls back. think will get credit but watch your cc bill. 866 209 4732 for billings. Our room was clean and nice. bed great. The pool is closed but still get a 52 resort fee. get app to self-check in to avoid lines. go left to front desk hard to find no signs. will hold bags free to avoid early checkin fee.
10,Living in a world where every minute counts my first impression at the check in counter was horrible. We had to wait more than 30 minutes just for check in! The line was longer than the passport control at the airport. You would think that Caesar‚Äôs palace being one of the best hotel in Las Vegas would have excellent customer services. Well NO :(  It is a huge hotel it should be a huge staff for customer service and again: NO! ‚Ä¶ I will recommend to safe some money in the staying book at the Hilton maybe and then just visit Caesar‚Äôs palace as part of the tour in Las Vegas
10,An absolute nightmare of a stay. I was charged over $1450 -- completely unauthorized and without cause. When we arrived in the room for the first time the paint was peeling and there was trash all over the room. We paid for a suite yet our room had no view and a false window looking at a wall.    After checkout -- I saw a $1450+ charge on my credit card with no notification from the hotel for another rooms issue. I've currently been dealing with Caesar's unresponsive team and my credit card's dispute dept for 2 weeks.    Save yourself the trouble and stay at the Aria or MGM grand.
10,I won‚Äôt be returning to Caesars Palace on my next visit to Las Vegas. We opted to have early check in but never received a call or text. So we checked in normally at 4 PM but waiting in the long line a second time. They charged my credit card $50 for early check-in. It took more than an hour to receive our bags from downstairs. After waiting all day from the airport I decided to take a shower and just wait in a towel for my bags. Everything is overpriced the lines are too long I am not impressed with Caesar‚Äôs Palace and I will not recommend it to family and friends. We were charged for items from the mini bar that we didn‚Äôt take or open for example a bottle of Grey goose. I had to photograph it to prove that we did not open it nor did we even touch it. So why the charges? This weekend was a rip off.
30,Self park is almost 3/4 a mile walk to the lobby to check in. Room was not clean sinks were clogged. They double charged us for parking. They don't tell you what your room package entails. Very rude.
50,Very well located in the middle of the Strip a lot of places to eat a 24h open restaurant/bar everything you need there great casino Every one there is very pleased and welcoming. Beautiful room with foutains view.
10,Being one of the most luxurious buildings in Vegas I thought the hotel would equate to the Caesars grandiose and luxurious not the case. Customer Service was terrible everything overpriced. Resort Fees on top of fees for parking overall not worth it.
40,"I enjoyed this hotel stay however after 3.5 days our room still had not been cleaned no clean towels etc. We would leave the room every day by 7:00 a.m. return around 3-5 p.m and the rooms still had not been cleaned We even caught the maids across the hall and asked them to clean the room every day starting Thursday morning she said thanks ""I clean for you""..wellwe caught a maid everyday and asked for new towels and to our supririse no towels or clean room. The noise was horrible. though I appreciated the upgrade to the Palisades the room was next to all the backdoor deliveries and starting at 3:00 a.m. all you heard for hours was the ""BEEP"" ""BEEP"" ""BEEP"" of delivery trucks backing up to docks. How annoying. When I call the front desk to check out and spoke to TOM and advised him of this all I got was ok thank you.. I'll let the manager know so any effort on their part to resolve or address the issues ???? Don't waste your time letting them know and make sure you DEMAND your room to be cleaned instead of talking to maids who barely understood the english language. I would expect someone to reachout to me but I won't hold my breath."
50,My adult family ate at three separate sit down restaurants and the food was excellent. We shopped at high end stores walked the venue and were greeted by friendly staff. Caesars accommodations are such that a guest does not have to leave the establishment to enjoy the experience. We were pleased and would book again.
40,3rd visit to Vegas. Previously stayed at luxor and Paris.    Firstly location fantastic as is Paris luxor a bit of a walk to amenities.  Check in took about 45 mins and we was double booked however they upgraded our rooms in the nobu hotel rooms were stunning but the views not so much.  Casino area very large and spread out again I if I'm honest prefer Paris casino.  Pool area stunning in comparison to Paris however the drinks and beds far too overpriced.    Staff I found very pleasant.    All in all a very good stay. What I would say is if for example Paris is considerably cheaper to stay then stay there and save the money.
30,The hotel is classically over the top with its decor which is fun. I stayed in a strip view room in the palace towers. The room itself is obviously outdated but they had updated the bathrooms and the shower and tub were amazing tbh. The strip view was a joke - you‚Äôd need binoculars to see it. The pool is gorgeous but constantly packed to extreme limits.    One thing that is ridiculous is that they charge for the K cups in the room to use the little K cup machine and it‚Äôs like $10! That at the very least should be complimentary - that‚Äôs insulting honestly and soured the hotel room experience.    Overall I probably wouldn‚Äôt stay at Caesar‚Äôs again unless a group a friends wanted to.
20,Stayed here for a concert I was attending at the Colosseum but I was disappointed to say the least. For the amount of money they charge to stay here I was expecting a lot more. The rooms are a little dated the jets in the tub were not working. There is no fan in the bathroom. The walls are paper thin I kept hearing my neighbors all night long talking and music which I know I‚Äôm in Vegas but come on. I have stayed at the New York New York and no noise could be heard from anywhere. Now the pool‚Ä¶ they have like 8 of them but only 3 are for everyone and the rest require a reservation‚Ä¶ what?!?!? Are you people seriously charging on top of what you‚Äôre charging to use something you are clearly charging a resort fee for?!? And the Wi-Fi is so spotty:.. and only 2 devices can be connected anything other than will be charged at $14 per device. Not happy at all.
10,"If you like wasting your personal time due to the sheer incompetence of hotel management then this is the place for you. It begins the moment you walk in.... 75 people on line in front of you waiting to check-in with only 4 employees to accommodate equals you not seeing your room for the next hour and a half. If that's not cruel enough you receive an email while waiting on line to use one of the express check-in kiosks only to find that they shut them down at midnight despite them sending you the email to use it after midnight. After your hour and 15 wait for your room key you can begin your quest to find your tower using the vague and sometimes misleading direction signs posted on the walkways. Finally!! Found our elevator and took it to our floor exit to find a lovely collection of sunflower seeds strewn across the hallway carpet as the smell of cannabis permeates the air. Room is decent comfortable bed nice pillows. Go to wash my hands no soap in the bathroom. Fortunately I brought my own. Wake up the next day utilize the hotel Wi-Fi that they have the audacity to charge $35 dollars a day for to check emails and read the morning paper and I instantly have a moment of nostalgia as I have not seen service this slow since the dial-up modem days of the early 90's. Dejected I opt to get breakfast at Cafe Americano in the lobby. As I wait for 5 minutes for the two hostesses to notice that I would like a table I gaze at the numerous open tables directly behind them where I'm informed that they'll seat me shortly. After waiting another 5 minutes for seemingly no legitimate reason I'm seated at one of the tables thinking I could have been on my second cup of coffee by now. Breakfast at Cafe Americano was good. After spending the afternoon in the casino I head back to my room and find that housekeeping never cleaned my room. Little did I know this would not be a ""one off"". I stayed at Caesars for 5 days and NOT ONCE did housekeeping ever clean my room. After day 2 I was confused and called guest services to make sure I wasn't on the list of people that opted out of housekeeping. I was not. Amazingly as housekeeping could never make it to my room the 5 days I was there the ""mini-bar inspector"" was promptly there everyday at 11 to inventory the contents of the fridge and snack tray. **Tip don't put anything of yours in the room fridge you will be charged $75. Days 3 and 4 I had enough of the casino and decided to check out the numerous pools. I quickly learned that the Temple Pool is only open on Friday and Saturday and with that about a third of all the pool seating. Once again like the check -in process I was left extremely frustrated. I wandered the pool area for a chaise as there were more guests than hotel accommodations. I eventually found a seat over at the Apollo Pool. After an hour in the sun I decided to cool off with a dip. As I waded waist deep the sheen of body oil and sunscreen on the surface was disgusting. The water was so cloudy that it left me wondering if the pool even had a working filter. As I turned to get out the white mucousy glob of obvious body fluid floating on the surface near the stairs left me thinking it doesn't. I couldn't wait to get back to my room to shower the pool off but as I stated before I first had to wait for housekeeping to ""Air Drop"" me a bag of towels as they never made it to my room. The rest of the trip I spent outside of the hotel as I 'd had enough of Caesars at this point. I did catch ""Absinthe"" my last night there. Great time I recommend it. I also recommend that it's as far as you go into Caesars. As I left to check-out the following morning and was waiting for the elevator I looked down at the rug and the sunflower seeds were still there."
30,Scandalous too have a mini bar in the refrigerator and if u even move something you get charged you can‚Äôt even use it at all because they just charge you last year I stayed somewhere else I had a refrigerator microwave maybe I am old school but they suck and the other room the sink was backed up when they used took a day plus to fix it was disgusting
10,We decided to get married in Las Vegas and made the wrong decision in choosing Caesar's palace as our place to stay. We wasted time filling out express check in only to get to our room and both keys not work. We were then forced to wait in a check in line for over an hour. When we spoke to the manager at the front desk Alison she was very unprofessional and spoke over me several times. Instead of apologizing and making it right she just gave me a piece of paper to write my complaint down and was angry at us. I do not recommend this place as people like her can ruin your whole trip. Now we are left with no room and a head ache!
50,Caesar's was amazing. Great location shopping food and the property itself is so pretty. We had our wedding in the Venus Gardens and everything was perfect! The photographer florals officiant and Kurtis our wedding planner were TOP NOTCH!
20,Not what we expected very disappointed rooms were old fashioned needs updated not the Vegas experience we wanted horrible view receptionist‚Äôs staff wer rude we were here for r daughter‚Äôs wedding unpleasant
10,Waited in line for 50 minutes at 10:00pm with multiple children. Reserved two rooms they said we would have to stay in two different rooms the opposite side of the hotel. I explained I had children and didn't want to be apart. The best they could do was put us on different floors at the opposite side in the same tower. I went to the rooms and they gave us a room with a single bed which was supposed to be a double. Went back down waited for another 45 minutes. They said that I had to come back around 10am to get a double bed for the next night. I asked for a cot for the kids and it came at 2am. The customer service is terrible. Went back down the next day waited an hour and ten minutes they said they would next me a room next to mine. I never got the text. Went to the old rooms went down and there was a huge line I didn't want to wait in again. Wasted too much time already. The carpets are dirty it isn't impressive. The fountains were broken just a sad old hotel. I expected more for the prices of the rooms. Don't waste your time and money.
30,Need a renovation. Bad pressures in the shower. Really exspencive in poolarea. One pool closed. Guest put a towel on a sunbed when the pool opens. But did not show up before lunch. We haved stayed here several times. But next time we will choose venetian instead
40,My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights as a quick anniversary trip. We have been to Vegas several times and each time try to stay at a different hotel. It is a great location. The staff are friendly and helpful. There is construction going on but it didn't impact us at all really. Like everything else it costs for everything. For example early check in $55 late check out $60 to $90 depending on how long and of course the daily resort fee. Everything is 3 times more expensive in the hotel. Even a bottle of water is $7. That is expected. Just across the street things are much more reasonable and plenty of breakfast options within a few minutes walking. Even a Dunkin Donuts across the street. The room was clean and nice. The furniture definitely had obvious signs of wear visible scratches down to the bare wood in a lot of spots and the faucet in the bathroom was not in the best working condition. To turn it on you really had to push hard. One thing I found odd was there was only one bar of soap and no extra toilet paper. You had to bring the soap in and out of the shower to keep it by the sink. The pillows were very soft they give you two each and you needed them. The bed is a little firm but comfortable. Our floor was very quiet and we had no noise. The elevators were fast and like I said the location is great. I would stay here again.
50,You gotta stay here cause it‚Äôs right in the middle of all the action and has the forum shops and restaurants and best service ever especially Eric at diamond check in don‚Äôt miss Caesar‚Äôs on your next Vegas trip
40,We spent 4 nights at Caesar's Palace. We enjoyed our stay and had no complaints about check-in our room or the room service. Our room was updated. This is a huge property and a busy hotel. There are thousands of people constantly coming and going but never anyone from the hotel or anywhere around in the lobby to give you directions on how to get from here to there. We got lost so many times on our first day.  We also didn't like that we had to pay an additional resort fee.
40,3rd time staying here- each time saying I won‚Äôt stay here again but couldn‚Äôt beat the conference price. At least this time we got a Palace Premium room which was much better than previous terrible Julius or Forum rooms. Paid $40 for early checkin. We opted for no service during our short stay. But able to empty our own garbage with the housekeepers in the hallway. They really should do a better job- dust along the bathroom wall/sink edges for long term maintenance. Otherwise the room was clean to the eye. Parking lot view over to the mirage. Again no robes slippers keurig free coffee or tea. WiFi includes 2 devices only. Pool was packed. Low ceilings in the casino and very smoky and packed everywhere with hardly anyone wearing masks. Caesars has the excellent forum shops for shopping. We like to eat mostly at the bellagio or Venetian or Paris or Aria (and hopefully stay next time) which are all walking distance. Noon checkout is very nice although we left hours before. The resort is humongous and you will have to navigate through the casino to get anywhere.
50,We did a guys trip for the NCAA Final Four. Check In was quick very friendly. Rooms were outstanding we stayed in the Augustus Tower views of the Bellagio fountains. Beds were very comfy everything was clean. No problems at all.
10,Front Derek manager Omar shouldn‚Äôt be there.  Super rude and Superman attitude.  Check in took us over 1 hour (at midnight) with only 1 agent (Moses) at the counter.    When I was trying to get him involved he called me liar too. He said it was not possible that we were there for 1 hour.    Frankly for a place like Caesar Palace they need a better MOD.    Main pool under construction and they don‚Äôt mention you anything at the moment of the reservation or the check in.    I think it‚Äôs worth to look at some other hotel options at the same or even cheaper prices.
10,"Our first impression was having the hotel employees angrily wave at our Uber telling us turn around and leave the main entrance even though we were guests checking into the hotel. We had to be dropped off a few blocks from the hotel and carry all of our bags from there to the main entrance. Upon arrival I had to use a machine to check-in which was not working and ended up taking 20 minutes before it would read my ID. We were then told we had to pay an additional $30 to ""check-in early"" even though it was 3:15pm (and the room was ready) because check-in time was not until 4pm. After we stood with our bags in the middle of the casino until 4pm we were given a printout with directions how to get to our room. The directions starting point was from a completely different location in the hotel from where we were so they were useless. No one helped us with our bags and we wandered all throughout the hotel for 45 minutes looking for our room. As far as the room - we had to pay an additional fee to use wifi for our computers and there was no microwave or even a fridge that we could use. Motel 6 has better customer service that this establishment."
30,1. Check in time is out of control. Hour waits must be the new normal. You would think a casino would get you going promptly but that‚Äôs not the case. We stood in long line to check in at midnight and observed super long long throughout the weekend.  2. Room was nice and roomy. Bed comfortable with a good shower. No fridge in room which is an inconvenience.  3. Buffet and buffet service were amazing. It‚Äôs a must try.  4. Prices are outrageous for water and beer  All in all it‚Äôs just an ok experience
20,We upgraded our room and it was fatigued. Not sure why upgrades weren't made during Covid closure. Not worth the extra money. I left a tablet in the room and filed a lost and found report. A gentleman called and said they had it go to Security and it would be there. Went there the next morning before taking my friends to the airport and a very rude and unpleasant man at the security counter couldn't find it. He made a phone call and kept saying the wrong room number. Told me to come back. To make a long story short because of this stop and a missed turn one of my friends missed her flight. Went back to pick up the tablet and it still wasn't there. This time the Very Rude man at the security counter told me to chill out they would find it. Waited another hour and went back to the counter this time a very nice man helped me. It was his Monday and he was awesome. We did not have maid service used one box of coffee pods and it was on our folio at checkout. How did they know this? Wi-fi was HORRIBLE. You would log on try to get on the Internet and lo and behold you had to sign in again and again. Very frustrating. Then the valet dinged the rear end of my car putting in luggage. We ate at the Americana Cafe twice for breakfast one time we could use reward points for payment the next time we were told we couldn't. The best thing about our stay was Keith Urban which is why we stayed at Caesar's. We won't be returning anytime soon.
50,"Everything you expect from a large resort hotel in Las Vegas.    From check in to check out the hotel was very accomodating. The rooms were spacious and clean. It was quiet on our floor surprisingly.    The staff did an excellent job with taking care of me and my family on our weekend vacation.    The only issue we had was the room stewards forgot to refill our waters on the mini bar and when we got back to our room we didn't have any more bottled water available so we called room service and they told us "" if you would have called an hour ago we would have helped you however we cant bring any water to your room now. "" this was at 9pm so i was a little upset at this but not a huge deal.    Our overall stay was great and we will be back."
20,This was our 5th time staying at Caesars. We have stayed there previously for vacations and for business. The service has really declined. The wait for check-in was over an hour and now the check-in desk has been moved to another location to accommodate gaming tables it seems. We had to call Housekeeping on 2 days because our room was not serviced even though there was no sign on the door. We even told the Housekeeper who was next door cleaning that we were leaving the room and did not return for 4 hours. The shower drain was clogged and we had to call twice for service. Others at the same meeting as us shared their same frustration with the poor service or lack of service from Housekeeping. When I was connected to Guest Services regarding issues they were no help at all. No accommodations of any kind were made. Coffee is not even provided in the room you have to pay a fee to use the refrigerator the bathroom sink is chipped the furniture is old etc. We will not stay at Caesars again.
30,Lines are a bit too long for checking in no matter when you arrive that's my only beef. Room was clean bed comfortable.    Although I need to ask what happened to basics coffee and tea and TV? It would be nice to have those amenties stilll available.
10,I was staying there for my conference and had terrible experience this time . I had water leak in the bathroom toilet and in sink which basically ruined all stuff including expensive make up stuff and my 75 yers old mom almost slipped on it . They don‚Äôt even give you basic stuff in the room . They give you coffee machine but no coffee . You have to buy that which I have not seen anywhere else . Staff is not very courteous either .
10,This review is only for the hotel (Forum Tower). Dirty and worn rugs dirty walls and baseboards. Thin & worn bedding not impeccably clean bathrooms. Terrible toiletries. No coffee (just a sad Keurig) or tea or complimentary water. Overall- I've stayed in cheaper places with better rooms. Never again.
30,The hotel in green rap looks great. It has a lot of amenities also. However the rooms and the hallways are dark with brown carpets. The room‚Äôs furniture is old and everything is dark. Otherwise everything was good.
10,Started from checking. More than 45 min in the line. Then they charged me for easy check in. When I got to the room. I found out the shower is dirty. I called the housekeeping and they said they will send somebody. I had to go to register for my conference. When I got back 2 hours later. Shower was not cleaned. When I called again they said some non sense. I told them I have forest and do it tomorrow. Next day I left in the morning and came back in afternoon. The beds were made but shower was still dirty. I called and again was told somebody would come. It took 5 calls to finally get it cleaned. When I complained to front desk they credited my account for only 30 $ to be used for food and beverages. Then at check out they said they will use the credit toward the mini bar use and I owe then nothing for minibar. Later in afternoon I received an email which shows I am charged for mini bar. Also they charged me for an item I never took. I called their billing. They are not workin on weekend!!!!!!!!!!!!! My check out day is today 04/03/2022. I would never go back. This is unacceptable.
10,Terribly disappointed in my experience at Caesars this past week. I had purchased a few cigars at Caesars Montecristo Cigar bar and left a few in my room while I was at meetings during the day. When I got back at night I realized one of them was missing. The only person that would have been in the room was housekeeping. Given that it was a $36 cigar I called to make a complaint. Front desk said I had to report it to security. I said it's not that serious I just want to have this credited back to me. They insisted I deal with security.    I called security and filed a report. They did not sound like they were taking me seriously which I can understand but at the end of the day if this housekeeper was stealing my cigars what else were they stealing from other guests? The next day I checked in with the security desk to ask if they could have the hotel credit me back and the officer said he couldn't locate my report. I was pressed for time so I said ok if you locate it please call me. No call.    Upon checkout I mentioned this again to the front desk agent and he seemed surprised but said that he woidl have to have a manager followup instead of just crediting me the $36 a drop in the bucket for a place like this. Moreover our team had reserved several hundred rooms at this property for a conference so a $36 credit for a stolen cigar should have been the least of their worries.    I have stayed at Caesars properties 5x while visiting Vegas and AC and this alone pushed me to try MGM.
10,Room was extremely dirty when we arrived. When we called to get it cleaned response was that it had to wait until the morning. Staff not polite when we told them story in the morning. Would not stay there again.
10,After waiting to check in for nearly an hour they informed me that there would be an early check-in fee of $50. The room was ready no further work on their part was required. But i had shown up before 4 o'clock their very late check-in time. So the room is ready and they charge $50 -- OR i was told i could come back at 4 ... and wait on line again. In addition not particularly good food and they charged me for 2 candy bars in my room that i did not have. Very very bad place i will never go there again....
50,Booked a vacation package and decided to try Caesars Palace. Was a little nervous after reading some of the reviews but we had a great experience. Booked 2 pool view rooms in the Octavius tower and sent a request to have them adjoining or close together. Was advised they would do their best but it would depend on availability when we checked in. We arrived on a Saturday night when the hotel was sold out and I figured there wasn't much hope our rooms would be together. There was no line to check in when we arrived (it was about 9pm) front desk staff was very nice and we were pleasantly surprised that our rooms were right next door to each other. Rooms were large and clean with great view of pool. Requested housekeeping service at check in and they came every day and did a great job. Pool area was very nice and there were plenty of lounge chairs. The hotel is very large and it can be easy to get twisted around - if walking a lot is an issue for you then you probably want to stay somewhere else. This wasn't an issue for us. The resort fee is expensive but we knew this when we booked so although I don't agree with resort fees we were prepared for it. Ate at Cafe American and had excellent service and food. One of the best things about Caesars is their location in the middle of the strip which makes it easy to get to all of the other hotels and attractions.
10,Paid for express check-in and every kiosk was broken. Waited over an hour in line to get our room. The concierge staff was horribly rude to us. Had to walk across the street with all of our luggage to get a cab. Very poor hospitality. I have stayed at ceasars twice before and will not return. Do better Ceasars!
50,We have been coming to Caesars for years now and always have an amazing time. Julia in VIP went above and beyond to make my sisters birthday the best one ever and we will always be thankful for her. Truly one of the nicest most welcoming hotel employees we have come across. If you can splurge the Augustus tower is incomparable to the rest of the hotel and has the best view of the Bellagio fountain! Thank you again Julia and CP Las Vegas :)
10,This was by far the worst hotel experience in my life. I called the hotel 4 times to tell them my father was on the floor in the hallway and needed medical attention- no one ever came. When security came his key did not work so they told him they couldn‚Äôt let him in the room and left him on the floor with a twisted ankle!! After this we come to find out the door it self was broken- not our fault!! After all was said and done they said they would refund the night. When i get home the refund was for the cheapest night we stayed and they only refund the original booking of $150 not the upgrade amount we paid when arriving. We should have received the upgrade fee refund as UPGRADED room door was broken and we could not get into our room and then couldn‚Äôt leave our room because no one came to fix it and we would not be able to get back in. Long story short there are plenty of Vegas hotels better than this and i will never stay there again after the treatment we received. We were also booked with a family and friends players card and still was treated like this.    Do not recommend at all!
10,Best rate is not guaranteed like it said on the website. Reservation made with ETA is 2:00pm. Got there at 2:30pm and was charged $55 for early check in room available instantly. If don‚Äôt want to pay the fees have to wait till 4pm or until room available. BS
30,Clean but not perfect. Overall stay was nice. Didn't use the pool since we went during a chilly time. Wish we weren't limited to 2 wifi devices. Everyone carries almost 3 devices these days and while you aren't on all of them at one time you could be so to limit you and charge you the resort fees is how they get you.
50,This trip was long overdue as we waged the battle of Covid and can NOW travel with confidence to a place where we all love. Our Host was perfect in accommodating us. And we shall be back because of his hospitality.
50,Eric in the Diamond lounge was a huge help during our stay and an overall pleasure to work with. We had some unfortunate trouble upon check in with another host and Eric was able to make the corrections quickly and with a great personality. Overall made a frustrating experience disappear. Thanks Eric!
30,At first glance Caesar's Palace appears mind-blowing. The outside facade the statues the mock-up of the Coliseum the ornate furnishings - all very nicely done. Get beyond the surface and you see all the chinks.    Check in can be a nightmare unless you have 7 Diamond status. You can expect to be in line for a long time otherwise. Similar for all the coffee shops and restaurants (unless you have a reservation).    The place is extremely large though a map is provided to help you navigate.    The room itself was large and comfortable. We stayed in the Palace Tower. However simple things could have been done to make it better. For example the TV had no ability to turn it to allow easy viewing from the sitting area. The room could have been cleaned better - I found a couple of M&Ms at the bottom of the bed.    The bathroom is clean and had marble flooring. There was a jacuzzi tub which was nice but the shower though grand in appearance had the water pressure of an elderly man with bladder problems. At times the water would almost stop completely then the pressure would increase ever so slightly only for it to drop precipitously in the next couple of minutes. I would have expected the toilet in a plush hotel like this to have a ceramic seat but instead it was hard plastic. No robes were provided - several hotels of a much more modest price point supply these.    Only a few of the pools were open - they were almost always crowded with no ability to actually swim.    The fitness center is very well equipped and even during busy times allowed an efficient workout.    The hotel will nickel and dime you for most things. Though you pay a large resort fee there are numerous hidden costs. You can expect a minibar at such a place to be expensive which is fine. However if you want to just put something of your own in the fridge there is a $75 charge. The resort fee covers only 2 gadgets to connect to the WiFi otherwise each additional device is about $15/day. This is ridiculous especially if traveling with family members.    The upsides include good food at the restaurants a great location on the Strip and friendly staff.    Overall if you are expecting a super-luxury stay well as long as you're willing to pay extra for what many other places would have given as standard you might get what you want. I was not impressed.
20,We had premium room but it was dirty you can see the dirty on almost everything looks like not cleaned for weeks.  No complimentary food/drink in the rooms.  Very pricey. $13 for half liter water bottle.  Omnia Nightclub - No lights expensive and okish music
20,Rooms were not clean! There was food crumbs an M&M and an acrylic nail on the side of the bed! Bathtub sprayer did not work and bathroom in general was not clean. Shower and floor was grimy and gross. Wi-Fi was terrible and lighting was poor.
20,Waited in line for 2 hours (at 2:00 am) to check in because online check in wouldn‚Äôt work. I was told that my room was given away because I was late and didn‚Äôt call even though I paid one nights deposit. I tried to call to let them know but no one answered. Gave me another room and told me I would have to change rooms the next day. I was told to have my stuff ready by the door by 11:00 am and someone would move it to another room while I was at my conference. They called me at 5:30 pm to tell me the new room was ready and I asked if my luggage had been moved. They answered no we can‚Äôt move your luggage without you there and I asked if it was still in my old room. They answered they didn‚Äôt know where my luggage was. Had to leave the event I was at and go back to the hotel to find my luggage and get this straightened out. I was then able to stay in the same room. It was ridiculous and a waste of my time.  Also the internet and cell service was the worst I‚Äôve ever experienced. I could hardly stay connected to Wi-Fi and only intermittent service to make calls.  I would never stay here again.
50,Cecil was great she found an amazing upgrade for my birthday and made the process of check in simple and welcoming. Always with great attitude and patience I stayed for 2 nights and the hotel has easy access to the main strip's restaurants and other hotels.  Thank you!!
10,"I stayed at Cesars Palace for several nights. I cannot recommend it to anyone. There are better hotels in Las Vegas for the money. I was given a free ""upgrade"" at the front desk. This was unfortunately a downgrade as the room was smaller and had a worse view. There was no response to complaint emails. Go to another hotel like the Bellagio or Treasure Island if you want a nice vacation. Too bad"
10,I have stayed all over Las Vegas and have stayed at Caesars before. Never had such a horrible experience and never had to deal with such poor customer service and staff they just don‚Äôt care. On top of all that I checked out on a Saturday and they charge me for two extra night. They were so many places to stay in Las Vegas. This should not be the one that you choose. I am A business owner and if I ran my business like this I wouldn‚Äôt have one.
20,Came for a conference being held at that hotel. Decided to stay at Caesar‚Äôs even though I could find a cheaper place for the amount of time I planned to spend in the room.  Arrived to find no soap despite bathroom having 2 sinks a shower and a jacuzzi tub. I called the front desk and requested some be sent up which they did in a timely manner.  Room itself was fine despite gap in carpet seam that ran the length of the floor and minimal view.  Monday morning- my day to sleep in- was awoken at 6:30am by workers outside my 5th floor window using electric tools and shouting loudly.  This was followed by housekeeping knocking on my door at 9am and again at 10:30 despite the 11am checkout time.  Internet was problematic too. Had a phone & tablet that connected first day with no issues but wouldn‚Äôt connect on second day. When I tried to reconnect I got message telling me I was over my 2device limit and would be charged $14 if I wanted to continue with sign on.  For the amount I paid for the room I expected better.
30,The staff and housekeeping were very nice and friendly. The room was comfortable but is definitely showing signs of age and wear. The leather headboards were torn and worn through in spots and some of the trim in bathroom was missing. The water from the shower leaked into the room with the toilet. There was no hairdryer provided. There was a coffee maker but no pods were given without incurring an extra charge. You cannot use the refrigerator for personal use without incurring an extra charge. We felt we had less amenities than a much less expensive hotel chain. We would be unlikely to stay here again or recommend it.
10,There was a dirty sweatshirt hung in our closet  eyelashes on our counter jizz stains on the couch dirt ring around our bathtub food crumbs all over our floor when we first walked in. They were so kind they took off the 60 dollar fee for us to get in our room .. everyone in our business group was disappointed in some facet of Caesars Palace. Their pool was also filthy with floating garbage and what looked like vomit.
10,upon arrival I noticed that the room I was given had an electrical issue. Not one lamp worked correctly and the bathroom light would flicker when it was turned on. Also once you finally had a light turned on and plugged a phone charger in all the lights in the room would turn off. After asking to change rooms or if I could change hotels and getting told NO I was stuck with this room. I then waited 3 hours for someone to come look and just change the lightbulbs (had nothing todo with an electrical problem) also to only charge my phone in the bathroom lol ..In my opinion Caesars did nothing and also forced me to stay in this defective room. Last did I mention it took over 1 hour from the time I was dropped off to even check in! Place is an absolute mess I will never stay there again
10,First time staying at CP. I always stay in the City Center. I have a room in the forum tower and when I walked in I was floored at how disgusting this room is. The furniture is outdated and gross the neighbors are playing super loud music it has a smell in the room stains on the couch I just don‚Äôt want to touch anything in here and I‚Äôm supposed to be here all week. If my conference wasn‚Äôt here I would definitely leave! I called the front desk to ask about options and was told to call tomorrow between 11-2 for room changes and that they can‚Äôt help me. The pool is closed too which sucks. There is one small pool that is open and it was filled with half naked drunk teenagers that I‚Äôm told are here for spring break. Just not at all what I would‚Äôve expected from this property. Definitely not the experience I was hoping for. Customer service here is poor. Thankfully some nice people at the bar told me to ask for the Julius or Nobu tower tomorrow. The fact that the staff here didn‚Äôt offer that up again just speaks to their horrific customer service. I hope I don‚Äôt get bed bugs in this disgusting room! Next time I have a conference here I‚Äôm going to say ok but I‚Äôm not staying at CP.
50,Kuddos to Luz at Caesars Front Desk/Checked-In Office. Luz is an Excellent employee. She's friendly polite helpful and accommodating. We had a great view and clean room. We will definitely come back for more staycation. I highly recommend Caesars to my Family and friends.
30,Stayed for a week in Octavious Tower. The room was very tired and basic really but comfortable. Bed = amazing. Charging $75 to USE the in room fridge for your own stuff is terrible. The mini bar prices are ludicrous. No robes slippers etc which I expect from so called 5*. Our room didn't get serviced for 3 out of 7 days. The in room dining is impossible to access and calling reception is useless. The WiFi is free up to a certain amount then boots you out and you have to pay. The casino is great tho fab atmosphere. The variety of restaurants is brilliant tho expect to pay through the nose. The Bachannal Buffet is def worth the $ though.
20,"The room was is VERY poor condition. I reserved a room with a King bed and was ""upgraded"" with payment to a room with 2 doubles and so run down the headboards had the material rubbed off them the lights didnt work (except 2 - out of 8) and smoke was coming through the vents. In addition the service (other than check in ) was very bad. I forgot my key in the room and they made me stand in the check in line with over 20 people at midnight. I just needed a key."
20,The worse experience I‚Äôve ever had in Vegas . Took my family for a few days and I couldn‚Äôt believe they took 3 hours to bring the luggage to the room and everything went down after that . Dirty room  no room service is just a few problems that I had to solve without my guess noticing. Might have been a reason for not having room service but I wish they would have said something before booking.
50,Really appreciate the attentive staff during check in. Great rooms and would recommend the hotel. Beautiful pools be sure to check reviews for what kind of a vibe/experience that you are looking for.
50,Our suite was on the 67th floor in the Oculous Tower. Beautiful view of the pool and fountains. Room service was great and the size of the room was unreal. We will definitely return on our next trip to Vegas.
10,So what do you get for your $51 resort fee? Forget in room coffee.. that's an additional $22.00 Want to get coffee in the lobby? Expect an hour wait. Need housekeeping to send up some extra blankets be prepared to wait and wait and wait and then call again because they 'lost' your request. In all it's a nice room but the coin operated bath room.. ok not yet at least.. Caesars used to be the an opulent some-what extravagant indulgence now it's just a money grubbing experiences. From the 4PM check-in when the pool closes at 5:00 or the $20 hamburger at the food court because everything else is closed the value for the consumer is just not a concern of this corporation. I won't be back.
10,The worst experience I've ever had staying at a hotel paying full price not even discounted. When I tried to get help with my $70 breakfast for 3 runny eggs and one pice of toast. FRONTDESK SAID they only rented space to the restaurant it wasn't their responsibility to fix it even though it was room service ordered on the TV in my room saying it was room service. The breakfast was billed to my room.  We stay 4 nights at 350.00 plus a night the house keeping was a nightmare no one wanted to take out the trash cans. We never had a bed maid or a sheet changed. What the heck were we paying for?  When I asked for help with the mini bar we were charged the item was still there. They don't allow you to use the spa even when you have a spa service and you are staying in the hotel it is 65.00 for 3 hours. Save your money use discount rooms at least you will understand why the staff and manager treat you horrible you might understand. The are so busy I guess they feel they need your business .  SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY GO OFF THE STRIP STAY SOMEWHERE CLOSE AND SAVE MONEY üí∞
20,The check-in experience was upsetting. Very long lines despite having the option to do an electronic check-in which was meaningless. Even checking in online involved standing in a line for 45 minutes to then go through a regular process.
10,Was here for a conference in March 2022. Stayed in Octavius Tower. Hated this sprawling place. My daughter and I came for the same conference and booked at the exact same time. Yet our rooms were on opposite ends of the hotel and if we wanted to be together her upgrade would have cost $50 more per night.    The room was not cleaned when I asked it to be. The chain to the toilet flush kept breaking. Despite my pleas to fix it it remained broken.  Lighting was dim. I came to work but the internet was so spotty that I could not work or Zoom properly. Called internet assistance 3x but never got resolved.    Tiffany - avoid her. She was horribly unhelpful in every way. Staff appeared indifferent to guest needs.    Parking was $18 daily but to leave you were supposed to use your room key but it NEVER EVER worked.    Will never stay here again. Will recommend that the conference not be held here.
20,I have been using Caesar‚Äôs as my go-to hotel on the strip for the past 30 years. My last trip to Caesar‚Äôs will unfortunately be my last trip to Caesars. Their inefficiencies and poor customer service are very disappointing especially when juxtaposed with the memory of what they once were. Caesar's felt like a corporate entity with no soul. Long line expensive food poor customer service and no personal interaction. There was nothing special anymore. No allure; no mystique. They are the Costco of the strip (without the quick service and low prices). They are more in line with Treasure Island and Paris than Wynn Bellagio or Venetian. I am sincerely heart-broken at what this once proud entity has become and so sad that I won't be back. Good Bye dear friend.
10,This hotel has gone to hell. It‚Äôs very nasty the ceiling is caving in. The gaming floor has a big hole in the ceiling where stuff is coming through & falling. It seems to be reeked of mildew & mold. Carpet needs to be shampooed or taken up.
30,If our recent stay is anything to go by then Caesars Palace is trading on its past reputation and not its present one. Our room in the Forum Tower was in dire need of modernisation the carpet was stained the paintwork was marked and it was just plain dingy. At least the bed was clean and comfortable though. We were traveling with friends and their room was even worse. There was a hole in the wall. Just how can that be classed as remotely acceptable. They complained and were moved but it should never have happened in the first place. Absolutely no excuse so shame on you Caesars Palace
10,The room next to us had a barking dog. It took us 4 hours- from 10pm to 2am to get a room change. Our family was literally up all night. They gave us a $100 food credit- we were charge $500 for the room. I will never stay at this hotel again.
40,I was having a hard time staying one more night using my comps. I had only booked it for one night and decided I wanted to stay for the full 2day offer. All morning I was getting the run around and my last attempt to do this she was so smooth and without hesitation did what was needed to make this customer happy and didn‚Äôt have to resort to managers and me calling in. THANK YOU SO MUCH!
50,Firstly do not go to the main lobby to check-in. There‚Äôs an express check-in with personnel by the self parking entrance inside the casino. Way shorter line(s).    Property is enormous so be prepared to walk depending on which tower you‚Äôre staying in.    As a Vegas experience Caesar‚Äôs is great!! Right in the middle of the strip great rooms on-site amenities galore and a fun casino.    Our floor in the Platinum Tower was very quiet.    I‚Äôd very much like to stay here again during out next visit to LV.
30,Good: Extravagant lots of detailed artwork beautiful pool area. Beds are very comfortable and the location of the property is excellent. The mall fountains statue of David and other decorations were beautiful.  Bad: WiFi is AWFUL and quite frustrating. We were sitting on a couch next to the pool and were asked to get up or pay $150. Not a cabana or a daybed or anything. Just a couch. And the casinos smell pretty bad. Decades of cigarette smoke lingering around.
10,I‚Äôve been traveling to and staying in Vegas for work and vacation for a number of years. In fact during the pandemic in September 2020 I stayed at various MGM properties for almost two months. However I have never stayed at Caeser‚Äôs Palace. After my recent check-in experience I will never stay there again.    I booked a stay at Caeser‚Äôs Palace for 10 nights March 1-11. My flight arrived late on the first and their kiosks were unavailable for check-in so I had to go to the front desk. I gave the front desk clerk my ID and credit card used to make the reservation. He refused to take my credit card because it's an Apple Card (Mastercard) that doesn‚Äôt have the numbers printed on the card. He refused to even swipe the card even though it had more than enough credit on it to pay for the reservation and then some. He told me I would need to find an alternative means to pay for the reservation since Caesar‚Äôs Palace doesn‚Äôt accept the Apple Card. Fortunately I had another card to use as an alternative method of payment.    I went to the front desk a few days later and was told that they gladly accept Apple Cards as a form of payment.    Caesar‚Äôs needs to properly train their front desk staff on policy and making a guest feel welcomed during their stay. From now on I will stay at MGM and Wynn properties where I feel like a welcomed guest.
10,This hotel was the worst in a long time. In a ‚Äònonsmoking‚Äô room. The room next to us smoked a lot of pot and made our room smell of dope. Hotel security called. Nothing they can do. On 4th night my husband went downstairs and spoke to Omar the manager. He said no complaints in system but nothing he can do. The charges changed daily on the room along with a daily ‚Äòresort fee‚Äô of $51 appeared on our bill. The rum and coke at pool‚Ä¶$35 and $12 for a miller light. Everywhere is cheaper than ceasers to include the tables. 3hours later no cocktail waitress(at other casino we see they constantly. Do not stay at Ceasers palace. Go to Wynn or Venice. They take care of you! Other guests said when leaving they to glad to leave. I never said that on vacation.
30,Prices on the strip have skyrocketed! I heard that before traveling there and that is definitely true. The problem is the level of service has diminished. Hours that restaurants and shops are open are random and more often than not shops are closed.
40,Room was clean no coffee or tea.  Towel old & don't Smell fresh  Location Great very close all Vegas activities  Hot water not working properly specially morning time. All the Restorant Pricey comparing to the area restaurants
50,Eric was super super helpful with adding an extra night on such a busy weekend. I really enjoyed my experience here and will definitely be staying at caesars again when I come back for future trips. :)
20,‚ÄúResort fees‚Äù $$$ can of Pepsi: $12 Valet parking $45 (used to be free for those that remember) $3.99 bag ( I looked up the cost on Amazon) of mixed nuts = $30 at old Caesars Palace don‚Äôt want to/can‚Äôt afford steep valet parking charge? Well it‚Äôs still $20 to park your own car in their parking garage. Oh and if you dare want to keep your leftovers make sure to pack a cooler it‚Äôs $75 if you‚Äôre caught storing ANYTHING in the mini fridge (bar). Vegas Marathon on Sunday and the strip was blocked off our Uber driver knew a back way to get us closer to the hotel (we had luggage to carry) but Caesar‚Äôs staff blocked the road and wouldn‚Äôt let us onto the property. Even the Starbucks inside of the hotel inflated the prices. God forbid you need a coffee to put a little sparkle back in your step while nursing a raging hangover but alas if you opt to utilize the cheap Kurig in the room‚Ä¶ you guessed it more $$$. Pool and spa both ‚Äúclosed for the season‚Äù. It‚Äôs still a beautiful resort which is why I gave 2stars instead of one but the lit candle of the old Vegas charm has been snuffed out at old Caesars I regretfully report. It‚Äôs a corporation with no beating heart and zero regards for what patrons have been through for the past 2 years. Patrons who are eager to step back out into the world and have a little good old fashioned Las Vegas fun but are met with a cold calculated lashing of their billfolds and wallets. People come to Vegas to spend money. At $300 per night stay you‚Äôre making money for the price of transportation food shows booze and gambling - they‚Äôre making out alright. Caesars may look the same but it‚Äôs long lost what makes a great Vegas resort a great Vegas resort: CLASS. These people have no charm class or civility. And to rob your fellow countrymen at a dire time such as this is to put it plainly: abhorrent and appalling. I will never stay here again.
20,We booked a room with a king-size bed and when we checked in they said they gave away our room. They offered a different king-bedroom at $40 more per a night or to downgrade our room to two queen beds with no discount. We took the two queen beds üôÑ. They mentioned there would be no house cleaning unless we requested it so we left out all of our stuff. The maid showed up and cleaned the room when we were gone. Nothing was missing but we had all of our valuables out in the room. The maid had to move our valuables off the bed to make it. We then put up the do not disturb sign on the door. The day we were going to check out the maid walked in without announcing herself. We were naked and had to yell for her to shut the door. üò≥ The water got shut off before we checked out. Thankfully it was turned back on with enough time to shower before leaving. There was mold on the ceiling above the shower. We have no plans of staying here in the future. The bellhops were good.
40,great location everything under 1 roof easy to get around room service showed up every day wifi was good but limited to 2 devices forum shop walk is amazing uber rideshare well located check out was easy and billing accurate beds are super comfy and elevators are quick! but carpets give hotel a musty smell especially in casino areas pool is way too small and worse because half the pool area is closed gaming is scattered even had jackjack tables in narrow hallways. i checked in on line with ETA to avoid the crowded front desk but when i tried getting my key from the kiosk i was informed that i would receive an email when the room was ready! come on Caesers!!! luckily a caesars ambassador helped me get my key right away. the email showed up 30 min later. lots of restaurants but the food court is a disgrace compared to other casinos. caesers rewards desk always has a long wait. construction inside and out. overall a really good hotel but not perfect.
20,my company has the conference on 3/9-3/10. I requested extended 1 night stayed till 3/11  company notice and conformed charged extra $179 . However when I check in the front desk the young lady said I have to pay $379 NOT $179 for the extend . I requested her to check  she even NO BOTHER to find out and keep saying if you stay this is the cost to be pay. there is so ridiculous. ending up when I check out I rec'd the billing is $480 on the extend 1 day. Can someone contact me and explain? I will be appreciated. thanks
10,The rooms are small at the Julius tower for a family of 4 beds are so uncomfortable bedding sheets aren‚Äôt clean bathrooms was small view was disappointing room service would go in your room without you in there
30,Caesar‚Äôs Palace has been a favorite destination for us for many years but this visit demonstrated a few issues. The room telephone was so dusty the descriptions for the buttons could not be read and did not work properly the shower door leaked and the furniture has numerous scuff marks from the vacuuming. There was no towel service for five days.
10,During my stay a forgot a 1000$ shirt in the room realized in few hours after my check out tried to call multiple time when I finally got a link for lost items I filed my claim and as of today 2 weeks after I have never gotten an answer from the team.    I am quite disappointment because a 4* or 5* hotel should take care of this matters even if is as big as the Caesars Palace.    Would definitely not got back to this hotel. Poor management.
10,I was really looking for just staying at Ceasars. Unfortunately the room was really dirty Lamps were unplugged The Mini bar was missing a bunch of items and the refrigerator had food left in it from somebody else.    The lamps and everything were disgusting to the touch And there was a wet wash cloth left from the previous guess in the bathroom.    The only thing that comes to mine is one word gross.
30,Room was spacious but very dated tidy but not very clean. I was VERY disappointed to find the pool closed in March the weather was exceptional for the time of year very hot indeed and the pool wasn't yet ready couldn't' believe it!!! Non of the other hotels would allow us to pay to enter their pools either so 4 days very hot wandering around all day with no let up. Also our room wasn't cleaned for entire stay begs the question why we paid $52.10 per day resort fee? This results in the most expensive WIFI ever given that was the only service we received during our entire stay I probably should have complained at the point of checking out but it never occurred to me until after.
30,"Caesers is big in some ways but can feel claustrophobic when crowded. Wasting everyone's time doing ""early check in"" but the key kiosks are not in service. So expect a long check in line if you're not a Seven Star or Diamond. Service meh...nicest person was a maintenance worker we talked to in the elevator. Big surprise was NO ROOM SERVICE after 11pm. Is this really a casino? That's a joke. Also like most properties in Vegas still getting over COVID the restaurants show they are booked but you can often just walk up. Venetian Paris Bellagio are worth upgrade if you want to stay in the heart of the Strip."
50,My Wife and I stopped at Vegas for one night on our way home from Salt Lake City.  It was my birthday weekend and she wanted to buy me a gift.  I book a night and right off the back I got upgraded to a mini suite on the Forum tower. It was the best night ever the mini suite had a separate bed room with a king bed walk in closet big jacuzzi and not to mention the incredible shower rain fall top sides...i had the best 3 showers ever... the forum shops keep been the best anywhere in Vegas love all the brand names stores...
50,Caesars property is nothing short of state of the art in design and convenience. It‚Äôs a city within a Las Vegas city. It has everything your soul desires: Swimming pools (closed for the season in march.) Variet of up scale restaurants and food courts to please those appetites on the run. The room I stayed in Augustus was spectacular. The views of the strip were truly breathtaking. Caesars property is right in the middle of Las Vegas Blvd. and close to major Hotels and Casinos . Caesars is 5.5 miles from Harry Reid international Airport.
40,My wife and I just spent 5 nights at Caesar's Palace. We enjoyed it and had no complaints about our room or the room service. One thing though that upset us was that there was never anyone from the hotel anywhere around in the lobby to give directions how to get from here to there. It seems to me that such a busy hotel with thousands of people constantly coming and going could afford to hire a few people to welcome newcomers and provide directions etc. We also didn't like that we had to pay an additional resort fee of $52 for every day we were there.
10,When we booked our room the website stated that we were booking a renovated room. They must have meant renovated in Y2K. The faucets in the bathroom were loose there was a baggie taped to the ceiling to catch water from a slow leak. This was my first time at Caesars Palace and we will never stay there again! Not worth anything near the $500 per night charged.
10,"Took 6 hours to simply get a receipt. Insane that you cant simple log in to Caesars (or Total Rewards as I an Diamond) & click ""stays"" and ""receipt"" like EVERY other hotel. Heck I think even Motel 8 probably has a website that allows customers to obtain their receipt without having to call the hotel. Its so annoying. Also the bed was so soft & old it completely screwed up my back. :("
20,from billing to gaming to amenities they just take your money and leave you with nothing. resort fee for what? the pools weren't open as it was too cold the gym doesn't open til 8am but it's a 24 hr city? and we had a pre-negotiated rate for our company they over charged and now I have to spend my time to recover that money.    finally you can't get on a table unless you bring a couple thousand dollars the table mins are crazy.....
20,Room 6328 was not a convenient room to stay. Toilet was not flushing thoughroughly. The shower was not draining fast enough. It can easily flood if you are not careful. Was the room given to me because it was just a complimentary?
10,We booked a 5 night stay in a standard room at Cesars Palace. We got to our room and it was in disrepair. The couch was all ripped up the sink didn't drain and the curtains were falling down. We asked to change rooms and were reluctantly placed in a new room after talking to the front desk. The second room was just as haggard. The couch was ripped up and the shower had dirty towels in it as well as dried shampoo all over the walls. The bathroom was very clearly not cleaned.    We specifically picked Caesars Palace for our vacation because it's known to be a nice hotel but that was definitely not the case. Don't waste your money staying here it's definitely not worth the price tag.
50,I already had a great room reserved with a view but when I checked in I was greeted by great customer service by Joselyn and was given an even better room. I had never stayed there before but the first impression was great and I do see myself staying there again. Great view and great staff.
20,Did the express check-in and requested daily housekeeping-room never cleaned until I calle and asked for clean towels then ll of. sudden they wanted to clean the room at 5:00 pm - NO! Bathroom needed cleaned on the ceilings and the tub ws outdated jacuzzi style and dirty the side of it was caved in in the corner - room ws clean upon checkin. Unlessvyouveat at high end restaurants the food was horrible innthe 24 hour cafe - cold tacos beans and rice - and waiter did not care. The gaming floor had a large area drapped off so you could not see in it part was falling down and you could see a bunch of unused slot machines the table games were very limited and an entire area was closed off. Very disappointed in trip.
10,I honestly would've rather stayed at a Holiday Inn. Housekeeping never came when i requested them to come everyday so me and my two friends had to share 2 towels the entire trip. To check in and check out you have to wait 30 min in line. At one point our door to our room didn't work so we had to wait an hour for someone to come fix it so we could get into our room. There is BARELY any signage anywhere to find where your room is. We spent 30 min walking in circles until we actually found it and no one in the hotel could direct us the right way. Very disappointed since i thought this was the best place to stay on the strip. I will never go back
40,Hotel room was very nice however the  Pool area was closed and not open. For a family we did not feel like this was a resort vacation since the key area to be outside was not available. We did walk the strip but there were a lot of smokers smoking weed. The smell was not pleasant to us.
50,My flight was cancelled and decided to stay here. I arrived late and Jocelyne checked me in. She picked out a great room for me. I ended up staying at a high floor room with lots of space and a great view. I wish I could have stayed longer!    Thank you Jocelyne for picking out a great room for my quick stay I will be back!    Jeff
10,We had total of 3 rooms in Julius tower We did not know but this tower is absolute crap! The rooms should be repurposed to storage units.    You get to the lobby you have to stand in one for at least 30 min We elected the early check in of $40 went to the rooms one of worst I have ever seen! Outdates smelly and worn off my room smelled like somebody smoked there for days in a row. I have allergic Asthma Went back to the line another 40 min!!!    Rep told me there is no way they can change the room! WTH manager told me the same their fix adding a fragrance machine to put some new smell in the air.    $60 resort fee for this? Crappy internet lowest speed you can imagine The room was so terrible you would have a better experience at a motel on a main road.    I woke up next day with a triggered asthma attack due to crap and smell in the room. This property should be avoided at all costs I know they have better rooms not for ordinary people terrible customer service as well what a waste of money.
20,This resort is beautiful from the outside but the people in the front desk is not helpful and not friendly at all ( at least the 2 that I have encountered). Their cell phone app is not user friendly. The check in process is from the olden days that you have to fall in line a very long line in order for you to check in. I requested an willing to pay for a strip view ( requested it online ) I tried calling the front desk days before my check in but couldn‚Äôt reach the front desk. It goes to a call center that will tell me that I have to be there to find out if I get the upgrade. Later find out that I couldn‚Äôt upgrade on that tower. If I could have known that I already canceled that reservation. Overall I did not have a good stay in this resort and I will not be staying again here in Caesar‚Äôs palace Las Vegas. I feel like they ruined my last days stay in Vegas.
30,Be prepared to pay extra for what you may have become accustomed to being included with a hotel room. First I was charged a $60 plus taxes early check-in fee. Then I learned it would be another $20 to receive a few K-cups for the room-provided coffee maker. The only refrigerator in my room was a mini-bar with signage indicating there would be a $75 charge if I placed anything in it. I didn't even ask for an alarm clock/radio to be provided. Finally the restaurants could have cared less if I was a hotel guest and referred me to a reservation app on which the restaurant was not even listed.    While the property design is amazing and the staff very courteous I felt nickel and dimed to death. If this is the new normal face of Vegas then I'll visit elsewhere.
50,Very nice hotel. Concierge was wonderful and very helpful. It was hard to know where everything was. No phone access for map. Hotel located in a good spot. Phone check out was wonderful and very easy.
10,Our room had toothpaste on the mirror from the previous guests as well as hair in the bathtub and the toilet had urine on the seat and floor. You could see footprints on the floor of the bathroom that was obviously not mopped. The hand towel was a used one and the drinking glasses were dirty. I located a housekeeper and she proceeded to wipe things down with a dirty rag she was using in another room...even the drinking glasses until she saw the look of disgust I had on my face and then she said she would replace them. This place is not taking any precautions by cleaning the rooms. Your health is severely at risk
40,It's amazing. The hotel is massive so watch you don't get lost. Beautiful architecture and statues. Lovely fountains and plenty of photo opportunities. Visited the colosseum while we was here to see a show that was out of this world. Omnia Nightclub is here get there early as queues are long. Seen Gordon Ramsay Resturant also. Really lovely relaxed atmosphere. Massive sports bar. Defo thinking of staying here on next visit.
10,We had issues w internet entire time although they charge $50 a day (did partial refund) when trying to resolve other issues manager was extremely rude- froze our account for no reason so would couldn‚Äôt charge to room (losing points) There are so many nice appreciative hotels in Vegas and this is not one of them -do your research
50,We checked into Cesar's with a big group with 8 units booked. Emma did her best to keep us all adjacent rooms. She went beyond and offered us a suite upgrade at an amazing deal. She took her time to discuss options with us and did everything she could to optimize our reservation and experience.  I was so surprised that Emma and Caesar's took their time to make our experience the best one in Vegas!
20,Caesars Palace is too big you spend most of your time walking trying to get from your room to other places in the hotel/casino. The rooms are shabby the customer service is non-existent everything costs at least 3 times as much as other non Caesar's rewards hotels. The crap table minimum is $50 dollars the slot machines are run on algorithms that multiply even a 1 cent machine to closer to $1.00 per spin. The restaurant costs are absurd with a standard breakfast of 2 eggs bacon hashbrowns and toast and coffee costing over $40 with tip. Dinners are $50-$100. During my stay ALL the pools were closed down and I was given no notice they would be closed. I did enjoy my dinner at Gordon Ramsey ($112 for pre set 3 course dinner with drink and tip) but I wanted to sit and enjoy my martini before my meal and instead they rushed the first course out before I could even have a sip then rushed each of the next courses as well. Drinks were a minimum of $18 each. I had to pay $30.00 for a small pint of vodka to take to my room. It was so money grabbing oriented the entire experience was ruined for me and that was the same throughout the resort. Awful experience.
30,We came to Vegas to celebrate my mom‚Äôs 65th birthday so I rented a suite. The suite I rented was a great size but it seemed like nothing had been upgraded since the 90‚Äôs. The couch (chair) cushions carpets (tripping hazard) chandeliers and curtains (dirty and broken) needed to be replaced. The TV didn‚Äôt work right. For the amount I was being charged each night the suite should have been a lot nicer. The only good thing about the suite were the beds are comfortable and the bathrooms were great. I probably won‚Äôt ever rent this suite again and may not stay at Caesar‚Äôs Palace due to some of the staff were rude. We did have a good time in Vegas though.
10,They are very rude when you need help.  My second night I didn't sleep at all the people in the side room were having a party from 9pm to 4am we had a door that communicated with their room so the noise was very strong I called the front lobby 4 times and they never took action..
50,Nathan O. Was very helpful and had a great attitude! Made our check in very welcoming! When we arrived he greeted us with a smile and made sure to explain everything as well as how to get to our room after all this place is gigantic! Definitely happy he was the team member we had to attend to us!
10,First of all they made us wait for 45 minutes beyond our check-in time. Then they gave us the wrong room. We booked a King size bedroom but they forcefully provided us with a queen-size bedroom; even after calling room service there was no solution. The shower was broken. There weren't any toiletries. This was the worst stay of my life.
10,Recently stated Caesars Palace totally disappointed when was discussingly filthy. I have attached photos that will show you the condition of the room. Ran in and ran out didn‚Äôt notice till late night was only there for two days should‚Äôve left.
10,So many options in Vegas I highly advise you look elsewhere. We stayed five days had three rooms one being a large suite and the rooms were in poor shape. The Augustus suite had a non working refrigerator a shower that wouldn‚Äôt drain properly housekeeping never left water or coffee cups. We started asking from day one for water and help with the refrigerator- it never went anywhere. Our 23 year old daughter and her two friends were in a ceasar driven escalade that took them less than two miles- to the cosmopolitan and the driver demanded 300 and locked the doors until the paid. Now when they reported it they were given their money back and supposedly the driver was to be let go of his position but the service in this casino is terrible and so so much is lacking.
20,"The original room that I booked was all of a sudden not available. When I questioned why they said ""we don't guarantee the rooms"" and would not provide any further explanation. So they said they could ""upgrade"" our room but we went from a king bed to 2 queens. The room that they ""upgraded"" us to was in the worst tower. When we got too the room the paint was peeling and the baseboards were damaged. The headboards were damaged and peeling and the whirlpool tub did not work. We decided to make the best of it but we're greeted at 6:30am by the sound of construction going on at the pool outside of our windows not very enjoyable. We had 3 more interactions with hotel staff  1. My girlfriend called the concierge and they said ""I can't help you with that"" and hung up on her  2. Another with a simple question at the front desk and I was given an attitude and she said ""you don't do that here"" and walked away.  3. Went to the rewards desk to get the check from dinner attached to my account and the man at the desk was incredibly rude and was so dismissive that I had to ask him twice if there was anything else he needed from me. He just shook his head no and never said thank you.  I never expect to be treated like a high roller but common courtesy and at the very least getting what I paid for should be the minimum. I can't imagine that I would ever stay at any Cesar's property again and definitely would not recommend choosing Cesar's Palace in Vegas. One highlight of the property was the Nobu restaurant it was amazing."
40,Booked Deluxe King size bed non-smoking room. No issues at check in staff was good room was clean. This place is huge so bring your walking shoes. The pool is also big has pool blackjack under a shaded area if your into that. Hit the shops at Caesars. Ate at some restaurants. Thank you for your hospitality.
20,I‚Äôve stayed at caesar‚Äôs multiple times within the past few months (I‚Äôm a local). At first glance it all seems alright but after each stay I got more and more disappointed and I felt like more issues kept coming up. The rooms have a limit of 2 DEVICES to connect to the wi-fi and then they charge you 14.95 for each device each day after. I‚Äôve had issues with plumbing lighting worn out head boards and etc. One time when I used the hot water to wash my face the water came out murky and when I called they said they would send someone up but it never got fixed. Also once had a bloody tissue in my room and housekeeping just came to flush it down the toilet and left. Parking has changed recently so now HOTEL GUESTS have to pay for parking now only exceptions are if you‚Äôre platinum or higher you stay parked for less than one hour or if you‚Äôre a local its 3 hours (but i‚Äôve also had an parking attendant try to charge me saying that their ‚Äúpolicy changed‚Äù and I had to pay for 3 hours and then afterwards I rechecked the site and there was no change) Literally had one employee even complain about the company‚Äôs change in parking policy due to all their customer complaints about it. Also the resort fee is ridiculously unreasonable ($49.95 + strip tax) but obviously during the cold season the pool isn‚Äôt even available the wi-fi is extremely limited with a fitness center only open till 4 and the phone is only available for local 702 calls. Also wanted to mention the terrible signal that‚Äôs in the rooms too so that defiantly adds to the annoyance of the 2 devices for wi-fi while i barely even have a signal to use my cell phone data. Had to apologize to my friends that they had no signal and if they wanted wi-fi they had to pay.  To summarize staying at caesar‚Äôs is mainly going to be okay if you plan on being out of your room/casino for majority of the time and don‚Äôt having more that 2 people staying in the room (considering if each person only uses their phone for connecting to the wi-fi for their whole trip).  Sorry if this seems like a knit picky rant but I just expected more from caesar‚Äôs but I ended up feeling like they‚Äôre always just trying to find ways to charge their guests extra money while giving nothing extra in return. Honestly the only one good thing I‚Äôve experienced at caesar‚Äôs was OMNIA so if you‚Äôre planning on coming to Vegas just for this club then caesar‚Äôs might not be a bad choice if you don‚Äôt mind all the other stuff.
40,Got the Casino parking was easy to deal with. Once inside the casino floor everything was nice and clean and smelled great. Walking to the check in I had lots of employee greet me. Had an amazing interaction with Allison the lead rep at the front desk she gave me some information and helped me on a previous issue I had. The room was a bit of a walk but then I learned the shortcut to it. Everything was nice and neat and every employee greeted me. Near the Octavius elevators I saw some girls asking if I needed some fun and a young man sleeping against the wall drunk. I looked around for employees and saw nothing nor did I notice a house phone. My room was amazing . left a few things in my room water some snacks and my charger. I went to the hotel to find some food I would think this is graveyard and no one really stood out and most just were grumpy and had a bit of an attitude. Went around the strip and after playing in the tables  around 12pm came back to find all my stuff gone form my room. Charger was gone and the water was gone along with my snacks. I had a hearing impaired room but couldn't get a hold of help first I never really asked how the room worked nor was it explained. Decided to go downstairs and ask front desk if there was like a secret place where they left things in the room they found. I explained my situation after waiting on a long line. She directed me to lost and found really didn't offer anything else and the experience was lack luster. After leaving I went over to the side as I was confused on the directions. I saw her talking to another lady and I read her lips complaining on how busy it was and how she didnt understand why guests asked so many dumb questions. Eventually found lost and found and asked through my phone if housekeepers turn in stuff from my room. He didn't event look and just shook his head saying no and mentioned that no charges were turned into him. I asked what I could do as the last people that were there are housekeeping he then said I could buy another charger and food at the store. I got upset and said okay someone in housekeeping stole or threw away my stuff what do I need to do. reluctantly he went over and grabbed a form and wrote down that it would be a while before he could find someone. In other words it was pointless for me to do the report from the vibe I got from him. I seemed to be bugging him and he didn't care . Decided to head over to the store inside of the store and figured I would just buy some stuff till I got to go outside on the strip. I look over and I see a $30 charge on like 4 things I grabbed of water I say Never mind and the clerk said I can not cancel it while facing this young lady she mutters why would I buy it if I couldn't afford it and why did I waster her time. On my phone I tell her it is not that I couldn't afford it it would help if they placed the prices on the pieces I was buying. there were 4 other ladys and one walks over I am guessing a supervisor. She looks over and asks if I was buying anything I said no not anymore and she pointed to the door and said get out. The young lady kept telling her I called her names I showed my phone to the other lady for her to see what I had been talking about. She then said I will call security  I said okay and gave her a thumb up. I figured I hadn't done anything wrong and everything I said was on my phone and then afterwards I could maybe file a report on the things missing in my room and now I had receipt of the things cost me for their report. 45 minutye-1 hr no security showed up. I kept on looking and they were on the phone nothing. Wow glad this wasn't not really an emergency and I thought maybe the lost and found guy wasn't lying. Another lady Tiffany came over she asked what was going on and using my phone explained everything. She apologized and said give me a moment. She verified everything that I said and apologized she then walked me into the store and showed me the chargers and were to find the prices of stuff and did apologize for stuff being not labeled she knew ASL so not sure if she worked in the store or was sent to communicate with me. She walked me out and walked me towards the exit and gave me direction to the walgreens/cvs. I wish there were things in place for housekeeping not throwing or stealing stuff. I wish there was an easier way to deal with this like housekeeping looks at the people who cleaned my room and talked to them. Course they can just deny it but still I now have a name for the report that they can start if security is so short staffed. Also when this happens that there is no Hotel/fee if the story and report and filed. Had issues with the parking  my hotel and platinum card didnt work to get out I decided not to deal with it as I went through a horrible experience at LINQ and was not in the mood of dealing with this security or who ever deals with the kiosk. There should be kiosk for hearing impared or disabled people not everyone can hit the call for help button. Better yet make sure they read room cards and cards. Decided to pay went a ghuy walks up and swiped his diamond card and lets me through and then asks for a tip. I say ty and drive off. The property is great look also. I wish that more people took the opportunity to stand out and shine.
20,First thing $18 per day for parking. No other resorts charge. $45 per day resort fee. $60 for a late check out ( 2 hours) No change back from your gambling tickets. Coffee pot in room but charge you for the coffee you use. SHORT SIGHTED. I come to Vegas 4-5 times per year and I never will stay here again. As a business owner I hope you realize you are losing business
10,The property itself is nice and for the most part the staff was very pleasant. Where it goes bad is with all the additional fees and issues with the rooms themselves. We stayed for 3 nights and needed conjoined rooms. Caesars charges $30 per room per night for conjoined rooms. So we paid $180. Now considering the fact that we were booking two rooms anyways that fee is only for the purpose of charging the guest extra. There was no cost to the hotel to give us conjoined rooms. We stayed at the Park MGM back in July and they did not charge us. Also we requested a mini fridge for the room. There was a charge for that. I have been charged for those in the past so it was expected. They told me at the desk it would be $35 per night. When the mini fridge shows up to the room it was big enough to fit only 4 cans in! Every time we go to Vegas we request these for the room and it is always a legitimate mini fridge where you could fit multiple gallon bottles in it if you chose. So this little thing was quite ridiculous for $35 per night. We were even more disappointed with it at checkout when we were told it was actually $50 per night instead. We were told we could wait on the phone for a manager to discuss. But we were already waiting on the bellman to come for the bags and didn‚Äôt feel like sitting on hold for a manager so we just paid the fee. The rooms are supposed to have a tv inside the bathroom mirror. That only worked in one of the two rooms. Both rooms had switches on the wall to open and close the curtains. Those didn‚Äôt work in either room. Not a huge deal but just another on the list of issues. Again pretty much every one we dealt with at the hotel was very pleasant. So this review is not a reflection on the staff itself. But due to all the extra fees and the fact that Caesars doesn‚Äôt seem willing to budge on them like other properties we‚Äôve stayed at in the past as well as the rooms not being up to par we probably will not recommend this hotel to others.
40,I was checking into 3 rooms at the kiosk everything was going well until i got to check into my second room. I was very confused and needed assistance. I called for help and this young woman by the name Julia was able to help me out. It was around check in time so it got super busy real fast. She was quick to help us and others out. Meanwhile i was checking in this ‚ÄúKAREN‚Äù starts yelling at her. I see Ms. Julia being profesional about it and i could see her trying but she just kept going off on her. Ms. Julia did her best to accommodate us and i just wanted her to be recognized for her amazing job. I apologized on her behave for her actions; i just can‚Äôt believe someone would stoop so low to talk to an employee like that. I 100% know she got accommodate by management here and it‚Äôs not fair. Where is the employee support? I work for a very thoughtful company and just can‚Äôt believe to see employees going through this. Caesars do better!!
50,I am staying at Caesar's Palace and Eric helped check us into our rooms and was super helpful and informative. He was super generous and gave us the Vegas experience that everyone deserves. Thank you Eric for your excellent service! Will be back!
30,This was our first time staying at Caesars Palace but not our first time staying in Vegas. Because we stayed in the off-season our base room rate was pretty cheap so we decided to treat ourselves and stay there as we finished our cross-country road trip to Los Angeles. We even upgraded our room to a Palace Tower room with a private whirlpool tub for pretty cheap! While the room was spectacular- huge spa-like with a beautiful view overlooking the pool area and Vegas lights - we found the communication to be very lacking. The signage directing guests where to check-in where their rooms are and how to get to parking casinos and shops was seemingly non-existent or just very confusing. This is one of the largest hotels/casinos in Vegas so there should be plenty of signs telling you how to get to the main areas. We also had no idea how to manage the check-in process - we were traveling cross country and had a large amount of stuff - but no one told us how we could get our bags up to our room where to pull up or park during check-in (when there is a long line that could certainly take an hour to get through on busy days) or even where the check-in area was. I had to ask pretty much any employee I could grab to figure out the process and where next to go. This all made for a very confusing and frustrating start to what was supposed to be a fun and relaxing stay.    Also - we came with our small dog since we read that they are dog friendly (just have to pay a pet fee). However I would NOT say they are dog friendly. To get to our room we had to walk a LONG way through the smokey and busy casino which was not fun for my small anxious rescue dog. To take her outside to the pet relief area we had to take her back out the again long way through the casino and shops and because of the poor signage and communication I could barely even figure out how to get her outside let alone to the pet relief area. I think my dog would say our stay was no fun for her.    Overall we did enjoy our stay - the slots were fun the dining options were plentiful and delicious the employees were very helpful and the room was spectacular - however there NEEDS to be more signage and communication even if that is an email prior to arrival explaining how it works since it's different from regular hotels.
20,The hotel is under constrution. It was loud and confusing finding the elevator. The bathroom in our room smelled like sewage. There was no room service. I was charged for a drink from the mini bar when I didn't take anything from it.i was also double charged for late check out.
20,bartender by the sports betting and poker room was absolutely the rudest and most unprofessional person I've ever experienced in las vegas I will not stay at caesar again because of how rude was to me and my faimly. Would not serve us drinks unless we were spending a dollar per spin even after we put 20 dollars in each machine and then wouldn't said he had no intention on serving us at all even if we paid.
40,We were so jacked by the spacious room and beautiful view of The Strip! There‚Äôs a fancy little couch and chair in the suite that give it a very posh feel. But it should be a crime that they still are allowing guests to sleep on the mattress in the room we had. It is SO worn down there was a dip on the right side of the bed. My husband and I had to switch sides since he bigger - he would sink into the dip and then couldn‚Äôt move. Even in the seediest of hotels I have never slept on a mattress as terrible as this one. Also the water in the shower took no less than 5 minutes to get warm. And the fact that the fridge is stocked and unavailable for personal use is a downer too. $75 charge if you move any of their mini bar options out of the fridge. Otherwise the rest of our stay was perfect. Very clean rooms. Staff was friendly.
10,Poor Caesars. The property owners should be embarrassed. In our room ripped carpet chipped furniture dusty telephones dirty dusty items on the mini bar sink drains that do not an empty hole where the electrical cord to the vanity light use to be and visible rips and holes in the mattress box spring (which is exposed as the bed is simply covered with sheets and light comforter). Surly unhappy unmotivated staff throughout. There is nothing luxurious about the room we had in the Palace Tower and in no way would we consider Caesars Palace a resort. The standards have seriously fallen at this hotel - we hope the property owners will see this review and make sure that other guests are provided what is advertised. A hole in a mattress is a hole in the owner's pocket! Our stay 2.28 to 3.3.2022.
30,I have never stayed here and have wanted give it a try. Sad to say a little disappointed. The only good thing is the shower. It was a nice room but we were in the Palace tower which was far from the casino and not at all easily accessible. Paid for a poll view only to find the pool closed and had maintenance working on it. It‚Äôs obvious that housekeeping is not cleaning regularly. The in room phone was crusty and dirty. Towels and toilet appear were scarce. Kind of that with a ‚Äúresort‚Äù fee it would be better maintained. I won‚Äôt be back.    The casino was boring. Very blah. Was not fun for gambling.    Only good thing was having quick access to the Forum shops.
10,I am so angry it is hard for me to totally express the sequence of events that has led me to give the review I am about to give. If I was able to give them a 0 I would have.  They should be ashamed of themselves. They padded charges to both our rooms. We had 2 rooms adjoining in Augustus Towersalthough our reservations plainly stated Palace Towers. This was my birthday celebration. I did not receive a final bill upon leaving however after returning home I got notice that mine & another gals cards were charged with items we had no interest in using nor did we use. there were trumped up charges on our credit cards from minibar items to resort fees .Our group specifically went out & bought whatever we needed for a stay down to bottled water &coffee supplies. ***** BEWARE **** Do not stay at Caesars Palace******You will have to fight with them to get the incorrect padded charges returned to you** I plan on getting an attorney to fight this*** We have proof of their scam operation***You will get nowhere on the phone or online****so dont let them tell you differently*****I stayed at Bellagio several times & never had a problem wit h my stay!!! Goes to show that some of the resorts on the strip are professional &honest. this resort is obviously not!!!!
30,I've always wanted to stay at Caesars Palace. When we decided on a last minute trip to Vegas they had an amazing deal that we couldn't pass up so we booked it. We paid extra to get into a room early and then we paid extra for an upgraded room in the Octavius Tower. The room was disappointing. The headboards were messed up on both beds the shower looked like it hadn't been cleaned properly the tile floor in the bathroom hadn't been cleaned IN A VERY LONG TIME the cabinets in the restroom were missing wood pieces around the cabinet doors.    The casino was totally lackluster. They didn't have a good variety of slot machines. It's like they had the same ones over and over again. I had to leave there and play the slots at other casinos which defeats the purpose of staying there in my opinion.
10,Wow my family and I had the worst stay ever. Rooms had to be moved. Then they charged me a 135.00 upgrade fee for a non-smoking room that smelled like smoke and weed. My brothers room was worse for their 30th anniversary. I went to the front desk and with all thatstill would not take upgrade fee off! Don't get me started on having the taxi and ride share pick up far from the hotel.    Sorry won't be back
40,Travelled for a conference. Room was very comfy high quality of mattress. Conference rooms were spacious and nicely decorated.I I‚Äôm not a casino fan and I found quite disturbing that I had to walk through casino games to teach my room also people were smoking indoors in the lobby and casino areas. These two are the only drawbacks otherwise the experience was AMAZING!
50,Got checked in rather quickly. Was on the 36 floor. Very nice room. Clean. Comfortable bed. Beautiful view. The room AC was great. Hot showers. Had full access to the resort. Casino was great. Restaurants a little pricey but it‚Äôs Vegas. Looking forward to returning.
20,"What happened to my beloved Caesar's! I have been staying there for years and have always been treated so great and the price of things were always fair. Even if it did cost a little bit more you didn't mind paying it because you were receiving quality. Now... it's not much better than a chain hotel!! Let's start with the check in process and access to the hotel. First it was an absolute nightmare to get to the hotel because of a marathon going on. Why would you block off access to your hotel? They can run anywhere!! Then it was about a 30 minute wait in line to check into our ""comped"" rooms not comped after all! One night was comped even though it said for both when I booked it online. They said they could only do one night at check in. and don't even get me started on the 45.00 resort fee minus the resort! Also am  scared to death to even walk by the snack tray on the table for fear of being charged! I feel bad for people with small children. Find another solution for that it's ridiculous!! Our room was filthy and so run down. I couldn't even see in the magnifying mirror because of the dust ( see pic). I've never stayed in the 5 mile trek to the Forum before and now know why. The toilet wouldn't flush by the next morning so I went and talked to the manager. He offered to move us to another crappy room or refund one night of the resort fee and clean the room and fix the toilet. We opted for the latter and was pleased that it was all taken care of in a timely manner. The food is disgusting and outrageously expensive the homeless loitering is out of control and the minimum bet on the tables is only for the wealthy. I'm not an economics major but why in the world would you charge that much to play and have empty tables because most people can't afford it instead of keeping it and 5-10$ minimum bets and have full tables? So disappointed and don't care how many free rooms they offer we won't be back!!"
10,I arrived at 11:00 PM. I was shocked with the condition of the room and retuned to the front desk to let them know I could not stay 5 nights in that room. Instead of offering me another room I was checked out and took a taxi to the Bellagio - more expensive but a fine hotel. I was shocked the next day to discover Caesars charged me for a night regardless.
10,The reputation Caesar‚Äôs Palace has is/was one of prestige and upper echelon I am VERY disappointed in the expectations and the reality of your hotel. The hair on the shower AND the dirty toilet sealed the deal for me to never return and never recommend. Although the house keeping team came to rectify the cleanliness of the bathroom the actual housekeeper YET AGAIN missed the hair and I had to stop her from leaving to point the hair out AGAIN
50,I had a wonderful trip from start to finish. The room was clean the staff was friendly and accommodating. We check in at 9am and was given the option to upgrade or check in immediately with only a small fee.
30,Everything is way too expensive. Resort fee plus they charge 18.00 per day to park. We stayed 3 nights in the palace tower rooms were comped but not really costed us 201.00 for resort fee and to park. Food is ridiculously expensive. 6.00 for a small coffee. 22.00 for a sandwich at Giada's. The essential shops were very expensive just for a 16 oz. Bottle of milk 4.25. Best to go off the strip to eat. We wont be going back.
10,We just stayed in Vegas and booked two rooms each room was $1000 for the weekend.  We were in the Octavius Premium room.  The headboards were peeling into the bed (I wish I could share the pictures) I asked to move rooms because it was unsanitary they said no but offered me a $30.00 voucher and someone to come and apply TAPE to the headboard.  Only some of the lights worked the bathroom vanity was gross and literally falling apart.  This is a room that I would imagine in Circus Circus or Bally's.  Disappointing to say the least we used to only stay at Caesars but no more.
50,the staff was extremely friendly and helpful the room and views were amazing. the casino was electric and the restaurants and shopping were great. first time staying here and will definitely be back soon!!
20,"Caesars could advertise itself as ""Longest lines on the Vegas Strip"". After a very long line for check-in we were assigned to a room that was not cleaned and appeared to still be occupied. Tried to call the front desk but the phone on the room was not working so we had to come down all the the way back to the front desk (and property is huge!) to have another room assigned. Rooms are OK but some of the furniture looks old. The Caesar's Casino is very crowded so expect long lines for everything including a coffee at Starbucks. I can't imagine how that will be in high season. They also have this limit to devices you can connect to the internet that does not allow to switch off one device to connect to another which is very inconvenient. Also they skipped housekeeping for our room in one of the days after we had requested to have it cleaned three times. Hey even motel 6 cleans their rooms every day."
20,They won‚Äôt let taxis near the front door so you get dropped near Las Vegas blvd and half to hoof it to the front door. Only to find it blocked with no bellhops or valets and no signs with instructions. Had to find an alternative entrance while still goofing my bags. My bathroom door would not shut and it took 4 days for maintenance to come and fix. Hallways were lined with room service dishes thaa see t never got picked up. None of the ice machines worked on my floor and several floors up and down. Not worth your money.
40,We went for my mom 73rd bday. Checked in on 2/25-2/28. Nice hotel great room service. However for the money spent on the room 399 per night we had no microwave. Which to me was a bummer. Also in order to utilize the carrier to transport your luggage you had to wait until the bell hop come into work which sucks bc we were ready to leave at 7am so we had to lug all of our bags down without the assistance of a carrier. I think for the amount of money charge during the weekend the should get microwaves placed in the room. Nobody wants to get up and dress each time they want to eat
10,they Lire to me i purchases 1 room $989 nights for one nights on 27 February and it say come with Sofa Beds and nothing Came there is no Sofa only one small chair  i have asked them for Bull up bed and they told me they cant give me any i have to but my kids on my beds and i have to sleep in the floor this is the worse $989 i have spend in my life  and when you call them they but you in hold for more than 40 minute and then close the phone on you is the worse serves ever .
20,The room was nice but I paid for a room with a view of the fountain and they gave me a room with a view of the parking ramp. I tried to go and ask them to change it and they refused. I will not be staying there again.
10,Maybe I just haven't been to Vegas in too long- but Ceasars has always been a high quality high rolling casino so I was SEVERLY disappointed. I was there for a banquet and I we had gotten room discounts because of that - we paid about $ 325 a night pls a $ 50 resort fee....I expect much better for $ 450 a night. The room was beat up the amentities horrible....and dont get me started on the cheap toilet paper that was like thin sand paper. The casino is now huge and like a small city - good luck getting around - even with a map. I did a pre check in on my computer so we were supposed to just be able to get our keys from a kiosk but when we got there - none of the kiosks were working and we had to wait in line for 20 minutes to check in - at 2AM in the morning. We stayed in the Julius tower - which is not listed on ANY signs in the general location of the registration area and was still so hidden that we had to have someone take us to the elevator area becuase we couldnt find it. I would highly recommend you stay somewhere else. Ive had much better stays at the Bellagio and the Venetian.
20,"Nice large room but awful service. I have stayed in hotels‚Äîlarge and small‚Äîall across the world but this was by far the most impersonal experience I have had. All about money; nothing about service excellence.  Long queue to check-in and no concierge to help. I was locked out of my room and called twice for help but after having waited for more than an hour I had to go all the way to check-in.  Poor and very expensive breakfast options. I recommend going elsewhere - either to a cheaper place or to nearby Bellagio for better service and quality.  On top of an expensive hotel rate there is a ridiculous and hefty ""resort fee"" to pay at check out even if the pools etc. are closed.  I am grateful I was here on a business trip. Will never ever book the place again."
10,When the hotel rooms are falling apart and then something completely gives out and falls apart and you bill the guest for it that means that the Hotel staff to do that are worthless monkeys if I could use profanity in this I would but I can‚Äôt so I‚Äôm just saying this the people that I dealt with for this situation that our hotel staff not casino people not casino staff not the house but the actual hotel stay after I dealt with on this particular situation are worthless
30,The resort and room were beautiful. Updated and very clean. Be ready to spend for everything! There is a coffee maker but no coffee. That was $22 extra for 4 kcups! Don't use the fridge. $75 just to keep stuff in it. Pool not open until mid March which was disappointing since we paid for pool view and brought suits.
40,We enjoyed our stay at Caesars in the Palace Tower room. It was clean and very well equipped. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was beautiful.    We did notice that it was difficult to find snacks in the evening as most places were closed in the hotel. The one place in the food court had a line up a mile long. This could be related to staffing shortages?    Be prepared if you leave the hotel as you will encounter an alarming number of homeless people living on the strip. We heard the homeless population has tripled over the last 2 years. The hotel security tries to keep them out of the casinos but they don't have adequate staff to keep up. We witnessed some truly alarming things and quite honestly we will wait until this improves before we consider coming back.
10,We checked in excited for our first time experience at Caesar‚Äôs & to walk in to our room being dirty towels on the floor beds undone mini fridge stuff we open stuff. & refuse to give us a different room waiting for room service & still delaying.
20,they charge a lot of money for what one receives that place is made for 7 diamond guests as they qualify it but for a normal person I recommend many other hotels what is around.  one of the problems it has is the parking lot it is too far from the rooms. They have built so much inside the hotel that you can't walk.
40,Wanted to recognize and thank Tangela  for her all her help making a smooth worry free check out.  She made our wedding trip one we we will fondly remember and looking forward to a return trip at Caesar‚Äôs Palace
50,I checked into Caesars last week on the evening of Wednesday the 16th.    I have been a customer of this location for a few years now however this trip I was taking my mother for the first time in 20 years. My host booked my stay for me however it didn't have the upgraded room with a view of the fountains which is my favorite part of the Augustus Towers. I inquired Eric let me know wasn't a part of the booking.    No issue not his fault I understood and moved on.    Eric went the EXTRA MILE to call the host desk to ask if they could bump me up.    I thought this was amazing of him to go that extra mile even though I already said I understood and appreciated him even looking into it via the computer.    My mother LOVED being able to see the fountains from the elevated view. The room was great as always.    10/10 solely because Eric at the check-in desk took that extra step that I was NOT expecting.    I have had a few semi-poor trips to this location in the last 6 months. Once in September and once in early December for CowBoy Christmas. I was at my wits end & going to switch over to Venetian. Eric brought my hope back for the Caesars properties. My loyalty will stay with Caesars.    Thank you Eric!!
20,"Paid $62 for 90 minute early checking into $200/night room. And room was dirty!    Three calls to front desk over 12 hours unsuccessful in resolving dirt issue! No response from manager(s) to whom my complaints allegedly were forwarded.    Quoted $21 for four YES four Keurig coffee pods! Required $52/day ""Resort fee"" for only gym use and internet.    Bottom line: poor value for the money spent; Poor response to customer issues.    Caesar's has replaced person to person to person customer satisfaction transactions with impersonal digital only transaction!    Lots of other great and convenient places to stay in Las Vegas!"
50,The suite was amazing but you could tell the maids didn‚Äôt clean it very well trash was in the closet dust on the tv and walls over all it was a great room just could have been more cleanly the casino was busy and I was never approached by a server the whole time I was in the casino to get a drink my wife and I were a little bit disappointed about that and the walk from the room to the casino was a bit long. The view from the livingroom was horrible you just seen the the top of on the structures and it was gravel and trashy looking but the master bedroom had an amazing veiw of Vegas so overall for my first time staying at the Ceaser it was good
10,I visited the place for one night with the whole family planning to go next day to Arizona.My car windshield was broke and all the belongings were stolen . The car was parked in the hotel parking lot . We are not gamblers and the main reason we chose ths place was safety for the kids .I announced hotel security and all they did was a report . They did not even send someone to clean the glass which was all over the place.W e were abandoned in the parking lot. I was even charged 20 dollars for parking. This kind of stuff should not happen here .This is a 5 star place where you expect the best . I spent almost 1 K for a one night at this place.While still in the parking lot we called to make a complain but we were put on hold and moved from one place to the other for about an hour. Nobody wanted to talk or take responsibility for their problems. Huge problems with customer service here.Worse than a cheap motel .The humiliation did not stop here .We ended up going to the lobby where a manager that was called from the backroom told us that the parking lot is not their problem and we can go to the cops if we want. All I wanted was to be heard  have my parking fee returned and get an apology. The most terrifying and humiliating experience I ever lived while I traveled. I will never set foot in this place if the emperor comes back alive and invites me for a free stay. Disappointing and poor.Avoid this place  you deserve better. I will announce my travel agent to place an warning for all customers.
50,Thank you Rae at the front desk Caesars Palace! What amazing customer service. We were tired from the flight to meet a crazy line at check in Rae helped us out with a speedy friendly and profession check in.  Thank you! We give her a five star for excellence!!  Matt/Jackie Burkholder
10,I checked into Caesars hotel Las Vegas for a work conference. Beside paying for your room you also have to pay a resort fee of $54/night and with this you get the internet. He's the kicker you can only attach 2 devices and having a hot spot to use for your other devices doesn't work because you can't get even one bar on your phone. If you need an extra device ( aka your spouse would like to be connected to the internet they want an additional $15/per/device. I tried calling to speak to the manager twice and never once did the manager take my calls. Instead they told me i could leave my room and work and come to the front desk to speak to a manger they don't take calls. It is 2022 and to have a hotel that is supposed to be top of the line charging customer per device for the internet and not even having enough WIFI strength to make calls on your cell phone is unacceptable. I strongly recommend all vendors considering hosting conferences look for a new and more tech friendly hotel maybe then the manager will take calls. For me I will not participate or speak at conferences at Caesars again.
10,My wife and I had a loss in our family and needed a getaway. We booked and drove out to get away. Our room was next to a suite. The guests in that room had brought their own sound system with a sub. Before 7pm we chose to go back to the room and just letdown a little before grabbing dinner. Our room was vibrating. (I have video that I'd be glad to send as proof) We called several times asking for help or to have our room switched. The loudness and vibrations were impossible to try and relax and take a breather. On our 3rd phone call down to get an update with Security the person who answered the phone was EXTREMELY rude and condescending. They proceeded to tell us they couldn't switch our room. Security hadn't shown up. (this was after an HOUR of sitting in the room with heavy vibrations) They made it obvious they weren't going to help us so we reached out to Expedia to cancel our room and we left. We ended up driving straight back to California (Orange County) where we live.    Life is hard and when my wife and I need to get away we value our time money and quality of places we stay. We were treated as if we didn't matter. Our thought when leaving was that they were in a suite and we were just in a King Bed/ City View Room. Maybe we're over reading into this BUT we weren't treated as guests. We were treated as if we didn't matter at all. We LOVE Caesars Palace and this makes it hard to return.
10,Very Safe to say I will never stay at this Hotel again . It‚Äôs a tourist trap with an elegant name. Horrible customer service from beginning to end.  Booked a double queen room but got a king room with a twin spring rollaway bed. Spent literal hours dealing with issues at 3 am rather than sleeping and enjoying our trip.    Manager Austin insisted we read the ‚Äúfine print‚Äù when booking which apparently states you are not guaranteed 2 beds even if that‚Äôs what you booked due to ‚Äúavailability‚Äù. Refused to fix our issue or Comp us the night of no sleep.    Parking at ceasars is a night mare &  $18 per day We were not permitted to drop off our luggage prior to parking. Good luck dragging your luggage throughout the hotel by hand like we did. No bell hop or even carts available for your luggage.  Difficult time if you‚Äôre older or handicap because it‚Äôs a long hike to the rooms.    Have an issue ?Don‚Äôt bother calling room service you will sit on hold like we did for 30 min plus only for them to tell you to walk to the front desk so they can handle any issues.    I hope you don‚Äôt mind using with bathroom in the dark.  Lightbulb was completely burnt out in the bathroom    Rooms are very hot and stuffy. Even with the AC full blast we were sweating all night and this is February.    Leave anything in the room ? Don‚Äôt bother trying to get it back. We left a shoe in transition and it‚Äôs gone and no one knows how to find it .    Pool under construction    We waited 45+min in the line to get a players card . Daniel was the only positive interaction with an employee we had the entire trip. He says they are constantly understaffed and they can‚Äôt get employees to work there hence the long lines and lack of phones getting answered.    If I could give 0 stars I would. Save yourself the headache of bad managers and lack of staffing. Literally any other hotel is a better choice.
30,Elevators don‚Äôt work half the time and just issues overall. For the price I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it. Waiting 20 minutes as 5/6 do not work is a problem. So be careful when booking. Other than that and check in was okay
20,The hotel is beautifull service is the worst  We stayed in the octavanius tower room was so dirty spots on the carpet a lot of spots on the sofa hair in the bathtub dust everywhere i had allergic response. Hottub jets only a few where working  Called the reception  someone of housecleening came and wanted to clean the room at 10 pm we just wanted to sleep housecleaningmanager called she promised us another room we waited for more than an hour nothing happend i went to reception an enormlous line was waiting for me.  So we went to bed in the morning again i went to the reception the woman behind was not impressed at all she offered to give back the resort fee never again
20,We stayed in the Caesars Suites last weekend and we'll never return. Our suite while large had no window in the bedroom and the living room window looked out a wall 3 feet away. There was a Keurig coffee maker but no coffee. When I called and asked for coffee I was told it was $21.49 for 4 pods! Really??? The light in the closet didn't work and the door between the bedroom and living room wouldn't stay shut. We had to put a chair against it at night. The wait for breakfast every morning was around 45 minutes to pay $34 for dishes such as chicken and waffles. Also you have to pay $14.99 a day for each wireless device beyond the first two. You get free coffee and breakfast and unlimited devices connected to the internet at a Hampton Inn for a fraction of the price. We will never stay here again.
20,Arrived on a Wednesday night booked a strip view at extra cost room was filthy and barely a strip view. Was moved and new room was worse no view and was charged the same. Will not stay there again.
40,We were treated better than average during our stay at Caesars. I know it is hard to provide personalized attention in such a large facility. Overall we had a great time due to the location and ease of transportation.
10,As soon as we arrived the person who helped us check in the express area was not helpful at all and didn‚Äôt explain anything when I told her we booked 2 rooms. Our rooms ended up on separate floors and one didn‚Äôt have a view since they messed up our check-in. Didn‚Äôt clearly explain how that this could of been avoided. Then we get into our room and the shower door doesn‚Äôt open. It‚Äôs stuck. We call the front desk to tell them Friday. No one came. Saturday morning we call again no one came. My husband went to the front desk to tell them we can‚Äôt shower since yesterday. No one came. He called again to the front desk. We waited all morning and finally a engineer came at noon. So we wasted the entire morning waiting to have the shower door fixed to be able to shower. They gave us a $75 credit to apparently resolve this issue. No didn‚Äôt resolve the lack of customer service lack of attention when we explained what was wrong dismissed our complaints and had no compassion at all toward ruining our anniversary weekend stay. DO NOT STAY HERE! YOU DO NOT MATTER! YOU ARE A PAYCHECK!
20,"You are charged for looking at the Mini Bar! Yes; that tray of snacks sitting on top of the dresser with K-Bars at $12 each is rigged with sensors. Pick it up and look at it and you will be charged. Simply knocking it out of position when unpacking and you will be charged.    Cesar‚Äôs accommodations is no different than a Best Western in the Mid-West; with the exception to the highly over-priced Mini Bar! For example to use the room coffee machine will cost you $20. $12 for a can of Pringle chips. Wine that sells for $7 normally was priced at 4 times the cost. The funniest; yet insulting price was the $45 dollar fee; charged if you put your personal items in their refrigerator.    Now imagine if every time a young woman reached out to shake your hand in Vegas then said ‚ÄúHi my name is Bambi is your wife with you?‚Äù and it shows up on your credit card! Honey Badger (the pimp working the old stripped) told me and my son the price is $350 for full service. If that is accurate the women at Cesar‚Äôs would have been $1400 each. Multiplied by the four woman who reached out to shake my hand or tapped me on the shoulder would have been $5600.00 in ""touch"" charges.    There was a small box called the Romance Box for $32 dollars. Once I was charged $35 dollars for 2 K-Bars I was curious to learn about the Cesar‚Äôs Palace Scam. A few reported it had two condoms and two breath mints! Really Cesar how much would a bottle of hand sanitizer cut into your profits?    And if you think this topic is silly to write about think of the profit margin on such a scam. Think about getting paid $1 every-time someone downloaded your app from Google Play. 1 million downloads is 1 million dollars in profits. Cesar's has 3960 rooms. If they charge each guest $12 per stay they are making $41518 per weekend. That is $2162160.00 per year!    2 million dollars per year. On a bet you are not going to sit on their computerized voice answering machine asking you 20 questions and then placing you on hold while they connect you to a real person sitting in another country to argue over $12."
20,Reserved an upgraded King bed for a romantic weekend - confirmed late arrival earlier in day to make sure I would get the room I reserved. Instead- I got a room with two full sized beds- on a platform that anytime you moved in it- would squeak. It was important to have a king bed as my boyfriend is tall- in addition- it was a anniversary weekend- a squeeky bad bed- nearly on the floor- not ideal. I contacted front desk to ask to remedy - they were kind but not helpful as they asked that I walk again clear across the casino- to discuss. However I would likely not get the room I reserved due to they sold out. The line to check in at midnight - was so long- with several upset customers- I couldn‚Äôt imagine doing it again. So I tried not to be too upset- but then I learned that Ceasars once yearly open Pool and hot tub- was closed. Frustrating. So we then look at the spa- it‚Äôs non coed. Can‚Äôt use the hot tub together . So much for a romantic stay . We went to go see Luke Bryan at the new Hilton - to which I picked ceasars over - due to the 5 star rating. I should have picked the new world resort Hilton. Cheaper - clean- no construction - pools open. Not to mention cheaper. In ceasars i 3 star quality at 5 star prices. Do your homework - I‚Äôm not lying. Foood at ceasars and shopping was great- but rooms were incredibly disappointing. And no they never got us to the room I requested - but they sure took my money .
20,All the pools were closed and we came from Snow Country and couldn't swim in even 1. In addition the whole outside deck was off limits! We couldn't sit on lounge chairs they had taken away and stacked up. The temp was in the 60s and 70s it was perfect outdoor weather.  The fitness room is only open until 4pm - there was no access in the evening. This is very unusual and frustrating. Even cheap hotels have fitness center access until late if not 24 hours/day.
50,I had an issue with Priceline cancelling both rooms on my reservation instead of just one room. Allison was great and upgraded me. I had an entire mess with Priceline. This trip has cost me triple even so it wasn't Caesars fault. Tangela was so sweet and kind. I was so upset that I cried and she walked me through what I should do. I highly recommend Tangela at the check in desk
40,Very nice rooms but pricey. I thought with the price of the room plus the daily resort fee you would at least be provided in room coffee. Not the case. Take your own Kuerig pods!! Long wait times for hotel check in
20,Check in was very poor the receptionist was quite aloof and not very welcoming. Charged a resort fee which we knew nothing about and was told it covers the likes of internet which should be standard for a resort of this standard and not an extra. Essentially the room rate is not a realistic price with this additional and quite unrealiistic resort charge. Also pools were closed so could not enjoy any kind of swim aagin very poor for the rate I was charged......Would not be recomending in the future
10,"Bought tickets for a concert 3 months ago at the Caesars Colosseum. Traveled here from Seattle to find out the concert had been ""rescheduled"" to Oct.    Hotel management wouldn't help us out at all. Have $2000 invested in the trip (room here air car etc) and they basically told us tough luck guys.    I'll never give this place $1 of my hard earned money ever again."
30,When we checked into the room the bathroom was dirty. The person that came to clean left the dirty towel on the bathroom floor. The whole entire bathroom floor would get wet every time we took a shower because the shower floor board was loose. The bed was very comfortable.
20,"We really wanted this to be a good time but Caesars.. during and after our stay took every opportunity to cut service and security while charging ridiculous rates and fees for the the most basic things.    We booked 7 rooms and brought our staff and their spouses to Caesars for a short business related event.. team building and vacation. The troubles started when we got into the rooms (which were heavily upcharged if you wanted access before 4pm) and found the overly expensive mini bar (no more complimentary coffee or tea... $6 bottled water.. etc..). 2 of our staff did not realize that just moving something but not using it.. no opening it.. not drinking it.. just moving it... would elicit over $120 in fees.    Go outside the hotel.. but still on the grounds.. to enjoy vegas. Find every outdoor area overrun by homeless passed out addicts beggars etc.. etc.. on Caesars grounds. You cannot walk around on the ""resort"" without being approached hit up for money food etc.. and security? Nope. No security.    I am not talking 1 person. I am talking people literally washing themselves in the fountains.. socks drying on the statuary.. sleeping spread out on the grass.. not 100 feet from Hells Kitchen's front door.    Come down the elevator the next morning to find another addict passed out.. completely passed out... on the statuary in our hallway. We ask our staff who came down an hour earlier and they took a picture of the guy. Again security MIA.. hotel staff MIA...    Just a few short years ago Vegas hotel security would be checking key cards to get to the elevators. Now you have to get past the tweaking meth dudes passed out/sleeping/dead? in the halls leading to your elevator.    Need water? Need a bite to eat? No problem.. as long as you dont mind the absolutely predatory prices. Go into a Caesars shop.. and a Coke is $6+.. Water $6+...    Those cocktail waitresses that used to take your order while you were playing slots? Nope. Now its a guy selling you $12 Miller Light tall boys and Coors.    Check out and come home to Caesars doubling our check out bills hitting some of the rooms for mini bar items that were not used simply moved an inch... and $238 per room fees for ""resort"" and being allowed to check into the room we booked months ago before late afternoon.    The resort? Yeah.. construction and grounds that look like ""CHAZ"" from Portland.    We wont be back. When adding up the fees to the cost of the rooms we could have easily stayed in much nicer properties gotten better service and had actual SAFETY while being there."
10,This place is a mess. Chronically under construction but never updated. Getting a taxi requires a long long walk. Service is terrible if you can get any given the long lines. At peak check-in time there were at most a half dozen people at the front desk actually checking people in (it was unclear what the people talking around behind them were doing). The place is noisy and I don't mean the lobby and casino. We were on the 35th floor and cold not sleep because we could hear loud obnoxious music from mid-night to three in the morning. Avoid this place.
30,It os a great name and has some impressive touches but feels a bit run down.    Check in was a looooong wait. Maybe were just unlicky but we had a long long line of people ahead of us - even the self check in line was long. When we got checked in the guy was friendly and efficient.    We stayed in the Octavius tower - this is the furthest walk to the elevators from the lobby. Room was good - big and with a huge bed. Bathroom excellent with his and hers sinks and a wonderful jacuzzi bath. However we had lots of small issues - plumbing needs some work. Sometimes one sink would just not empty. Other times there was no water at all. Some lights did not work either. We did have a cool view by chance - you could see the Eiffel tower and the Bellagio fountains from the window albeit a side on and distant view.    We did not gamble too much here (I only seem to ever win in Binions) but it has all you mihht want on that score. We didn't eat there either.    Overall a good hotel but needs some work and that check in queue was a major pain after a long trip. I couldn't check out online but the desk person sorted that out for me so checking out was a breeze and luggage storage was quick and efficient if a little hard to find. The Uber pick up is also difficult to find and we missed one looking for it.
10,This casino is trash. All the single girls are hookers. There is no energy. There are a lot of better casinos in Vegas to choose from. Everything about this place is average from the room to the pool to the restaurants.
10,I arrived at the hotel around 2:30 or so to check in to my room because I was attending a conference the next two days at Caesar‚Äôs. After standing in line for at least 30-45 minutes (it wasn‚Äôt a long line either) the one person checking people in was finally expanded to two when one of the other people in line complained. They had five to ten other people back there behind the desk but apparently they were ‚Äútraining‚Äù. Once I made it to the front the lady checking me in said you know it‚Äôs a $75 charge for early check in since check in is 4. I said ‚Äúit‚Äôs after 3 now - can‚Äôt you waive it?‚Äù. To which she replied ‚Äúif we did it for you we would have to do it for everyone (i.e. special treatment)‚Äù. Okay first of all I‚Äôve been standing in a relatively short line moving at a glacial speed and now you have this gem of Vegas fair treatment knowledge to share with me???? The whole town is built on special treatment for some and not others (room comps upgrades casino hosts meals etc. etc.). I was tired from my flight and I didn‚Äôt want to make the people still in line behind me have to wait even longer while I asked to speak to a manager so I just gave in thinking that maybe it would get me a better room since I didn‚Äôt push the issue. Well I got to my room and no that didn‚Äôt happen. I got the tiniest room they had to offer. A few important points to note: 1) I‚Äôve stayed at Cosmopolitan Bellagio Aria Venetian/Pallazo and Wynn/Encore. NEVER have I EVER been charged or even attempted to be charged an early check in fee even when I‚Äôve arrived many hours before check in. 2) the $75 early check in fee had tax applied so it was actually over $85. 3) Caesar‚Äôs is the Kmart of the strip so go elsewhere and be treated like they‚Äôre happy for your business. I heard other conference members saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm over at Bellagio-I don‚Äôt like Caesar‚Äôs‚Äù - now I know why. I will do my best to make sure the healthcare associations that I‚Äôm a member of who have conferences in Vegas know to have their meetings elsewhere in the future.
30,"Overall I was not happy with Caesars Las Vegas. Maybe this isn't a fair review as COVID has put a strain on pretty much everyone in terms of staffing. The beautiful pools were closed due to time of year. I didn't know they were going to be closed. Was looking forward to seeing all the pools. My hope would have been that the hotel booked rooms based on their available staffing so that guests would have a better experience. Long wait to check in/out. My room wasn't ready until 6:00pm so I wasn't able to get changed for the show we were seeing that night. Self check in/out machines were malfunctioning. When I got to the front desk team member ""Defamo"" was amazing. He really cheered me up after the long wait in line. Had dinner the next night at hotel restaurant ""Chef Gordon Ramsey Pub"". Not a good experience there either. The fish and chips were so over cooked and overbreaded it made me feel sick. Informed the server that the two of us at our table that had the fish were both very disappointed. The entree was $38.00. Server did not offer to comp either dinner. Just said ""sorry"". Spoke to manager the next day. He offered to cook us the fish himself that day. We told him we no longer wanted the fish due to the bad experience that we had the night before. He said ""sorry"". Nothing more. The hotel had gorgeous decorations from Chinese New Years. Enjoyed very much. Self serve coffee machine in the room but you had to pay. I'm used to getting self serve coffee free in my room. It was a $23 charge for use of the self serve coffee. Wow! Room was very nice and clean. I found it uncomfortable that the heater vent on the wall was pointing directly at the bed so you felt a draft when you were sleeping. Usually room vents are not facing the bed. Very strange. Casino was nice but smokey. Dealers were great! Didn't win any money but enjoyed the experience at the card tables. Construction going on so the entrance to the hotel was a let down visually. Great location on the strip. Walking distance to everything. Had pancakes at the all night cafe off the lobby. They were delivered cold so the waiter brought us another order that was hot. They were delicious! I don't usually fill out ratings but I felt the need to since the trip was very expensive and I was disappointed with what I paid for. Hadn't been to Vegas in over 25 years. Was really looking forward to it. Caesars you can do better."
50,Wow this place is just out of this world. As soon as you walk through the doors you are treated special. So much to see and enjoy in one place why do you need to go anywhere else. Treat yourself you won't be sorry
10,I was terribly disappointed. The customer service was terrible. My room that I paid a small fortune for the jacuzzi didn‚Äôt work shower wouldn‚Äôt drain. Was told I would have balcony and did not. Told I would have strip view did not. Tried to switch and was told I couldn‚Äôt. They charged me for mini bar items I never used. The carpet was torn and damaged prior to my arrival. I randomly got charged for room service and a hotel employee came in my room unannounced at 11pm when I was sleeping. Very unprofessional. Not the service I would expect from a supposed 5 star resort.    Will NEVER stay here again. We stayed for a week as we were having a vow renewal. Extremely disappointed in hotel and staff. Housekeeping never removed garbage from my room. Just a very frustrating experience.
20,I booked a Kingsize bed room and they gave me a room with two small beds instead. In addition to that the bed frame was all scratched and damaged. Lastly the jacuzzi was filthy and full of hairs. When I went to the front desk to complain about the condition of the room upon our arrival and asked if they could clean it they never came to do so.
50,So this visit was to celebrate our 40th anniversary. Changed our hotel 3 times due to reviews on TripAdvisor. Chose Caesars for many reasons. Paid for Augustus Tower with the fountain view. Also a huge plus is knowing we had the kuerig- which saved hundreds. Our early flight from Tampa had Manny check our luggage. Then we talked to Jeanie at the front desk who was wonderful. So- we decided to not pay the early fee of $70 and waited. Our room was just as expected until the 3rd day when we lost the 3 lights over the bathroom sinks. Maintenance tried many times to fix- and finally Jerome called the front desk and Dwight had us moved and saved the week! Thanks to all on a bust SuperBowl week
50,Diamond Check-in  Eric checked us in. He was so helpful with everything. We were able to get info on spa services Restaurants and how to get around the construction. I have been to many of Caesars properties in Vegas and can honestly say. This was the best customer service I have experienced. Our room was beautiful. We were in the Augustus Tower with Fountain View. I looked up the Bellagio‚Äôs songs and times and from our window i played the song watching the fountains. Perfect view! The jetted tub was very easy to get in and out of. The rooms are very spacious and clean. I used Ivy instead of Housekeeping . Qua spa was incredible and The Dinner and drinks recommendations did not disappoint. It is really nice to get honest and helpful information. Usually we check in without any recommendations. Thank you Eric üé∞
10,Would never stay again. Burglarized between 4-9PM. Security is worthless. They say they can take a report but do not investigate! They took electronics and jewelry. I could see my iPad and AirPods move about Caesar‚Äôs and security was no help!! Room charges were also added that I did not charge! Horrible! They suck!
20,"This is the first time that I stayed at Caesars and it will definetly be the last. I went to the hotel to stay with friends on a trip to Vegas from 2/13- 2/16. When I checked into the hotel I was offered an upgrade from my Palace Premium room to a Suite. I figured why not and took the splurge. The room was spacious however the fixtures and bedding were in need of a major update. The room was in poor condition and several light fixtures in the bathroom did not work. I called to let housekeeping and matnance know however nothing was done to fix it. The bedding and linens looked worn and tired and was in need of updating. Another issue that I had was the constant nickel & diming of the place...you're spending over $250/night to stay here and you can't use your own coffee machine in the room without paying $20 for a ""coffee kit"" of one K-Cup and powered cream and sugar; this is something I can get in any hotel in america yet you have to pay for it here...what a rip off. I also found the service to be very lacking in the hotel - I called to get a small fridge for my insulin and was told that ""due to the holiday weekend (since when does Valentines day count as holiday weekend?) they didn't have anymore.....nothing says the suite life like using the Ice Bucket for medicine...at least that was free.    The casino itself was cramped and surprisingly very small and the layout was very confusing - I literally got lost trying to get to the lobby. There was so much construction going on that you couldn't find your way anywhere around the resort. Overall I have to say that this place is definitely not worth the price - there are much better resorts to stay when in Vegas and I will not be back."
30,Just completed a three-night stay at Caesars Palace. I would say the stay was disappointing. It started with the drop-off location for rideshares not convenient at all. I understand they are renovating the main entrance but that said the distance from the drop off to the front desk was a major inconvenience.  At check-in we were asked if we wanted daily housekeeping services we said yes however housekeeping never tended to our room.  Getting back to ride-share and taxis the pick up location for taxis was a long distance from anywhere and with hampered mobility due to recent knee surgery the distance and difficulty of navigating thru the casino crowds was unwelcome and uncomfortable.  As mentioned above I realize the front entrance is undergoing a major renovation but the inconvenience of the current drop-off/pick-up locations for taxis and rideshares is very problematic. The hotel doesn't provide notice/warning of this situation in advance making the problem a big surprise to customers. Caesars can and should do much better.  Will definitely think twice before staying at Caesars in the future.
50,Wow what else is there to say Caesars Palace and the VIP staff pulled off one the most epic trips I ever had to Las Vegas.  1. The Check-in Staff members : Yunie and Dan Minarsky were exceptional and efficient  both at the same time. I received an upgrade to the Palace Tower and could not of been a Happier. The King bed and bathroom hit the sweet spot after a long night out on the town. Get the upgrade room if you can it‚Äôs worth the extra money and effort. The blackjack tables were full everywhere so I had to pick and choose wisely where I wanted to play. The Big Game party I went to was at The Allegiant Stadium  not the best for viewing however the scenery was different and worth it in the end. I owe this trip invite to Lisa my VIP host at Caesars without her this trip would not of happen. The New Years Celebration was memorable here and this trip just about topped that. Thanks to the entire staff at Caesars including but not limited to : The VIP Staff Housekeeping bar staff waiters bellmen dealers  cleaning staff food and beverage staffand the Cleaning crews who made this visit memorable. Scott T.
10,I‚Äôm truly sad that Caesars was a true disappointment‚Ä¶i traveled from Oklahoma City just to update my information on my rewards account as well as get my Salute Card because I‚Äôm a veteran‚Ä¶i tried to check in but because my info wasn‚Äôt updated it was a hassle that took several hours to complete at least i thought it was but when trying to charge things to my room was unable to because my info wasn‚Äôt actually updated i spent 4-5 hours trying to get this resolved the first day i was there. The concierge (Ivy) was unhelpful and made matters worse with changing things then saying she couldn‚Äôt change it to what the correct info was supposed to be. So standing in line twice to get info updated was awful needless to say i ended up checking out early i went to the check out and they gave me a receipt but because of everything that happened previously i contacted the concierge to have her verify i was checked out and guess what? I wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶Truly a waste of my time and money considering this was the only reason i even came to Las Vegas
30,We upgraded our room for an extra $250/night to stay in the Forum Towers Suites. The room was very spacious decent view great size closet and master bath. This suite needs updating! Not one plug in the suite was able to accept a USB. I've stayed at much cheaper hotels that have USB plugs. We were told on check-in that no one would be in our room (minibar stocking maid service etc.) without calling and requesting the service. The second day there someone from the minibar stocking service came in and filled the fridge from the previous guest use. Normally I wouldn't be bothered by this but we had valuables sitting out in plain sight when this occurred. The first morning in the suite at 6am we had no hot water. I called and told them about this and was advised that engineering would be sent up shortly. At 9am we tried the water again and it was luke warm so we took a shower. I called and cancelled engineering assuming that this was just a one-time issue. At 4pm I was coming down the hallway to the room and found engineering trying to enter my room. I told him the issue we had earlier and he advised me that they turned off a water pump and the other pump was out of service and parts were on backorder (which due to the pandemic I understand supply chain issues). He reassured me that it shouldn't happen again but this continued several times throughout our stay. The furniture in the room needs to be updated the couch was very worn and the boards could be felt in your back if lying down. The suite had old scotch tape on the walls from a party that had been thrown in the room previously which makes me wonder how well the room is really being cleaned if they cannot remove tape from the walls. For the upgrade charge I was very disappointed in the quality of the room.
30,"I paid for Octavious tower after comparing pictures of the rooms online when we arrived was told we were ""upgraded"" to Palace tower. It was not an upgrade the rooms were not as nice as the ones I paid for. They said it was due to construction which was BS they just oversold Octavious and had rooms available in Palace. We were not given any credit since they said it was an ""upgrade"" will not stay at Caesars again since they apparently don't mind using bait and switch tactics"
40,This stay was our first in Vegas since pre-pandemic. Outside of wearing masks it did not feel any different. We stayed in the Palace towers and really enjoyed our suite. Very spacious throughout and I would recommend them. The only drawback of the stay was Caesars is redoing the main entrance which is confusing if you have been there before and more importantly effects Uber drop offs. The area for Ubers is no wear close to the hotel check in so be ready to schlup your way through the entire casino to check in. Then after check in we had to go back where we came from to get to our tower. Luckily they have easy check out so we did not have to go back to the hotel desk to check out.
30,I guess I expected more from an iconic hotel after parking our car we entered hotel less than 1 hour before check in we walked to an express check in and the service tech said that it would be $50 to check in early. I thought this was a bit strange and when I said no thank you he said to my wife ‚Äúif you can‚Äôt afford that you can try the front desk‚Äù. Not a very nice welcome to the hotel when we arrived to the desk we weren‚Äôt charged the $50 but were never welcomed to the hotel and not given directions to the tower we were staying in. While in the room we wanted housekeeping to come by and clean the room and when my wife asked for service and stated it would be a good time to clean it was after 1 pm the person on the phone said we have over 3000 rooms in the hotel. Not the response I expected. I did have good service from valet of spendy at $40 a day the valets were always courteous and hurried to get the car. I also had a good encounter talking to a front desk employee on the phone who listened to me vent about the lack of hospitality. I wanted to try a place I‚Äôd never been before but in the future I will go to the places where I get service for the money I pay for the room at the Venetian or Wynn Encore.
20,We stayed in the forum tower in room 6103. The room was dated the dressing table unit was badly worn and scratched the drawers in between the beds was badly worn and scratched the telephone in the room didn't work the light mirror in the bathroom didn't work there is a water stain on the ceiling in the toilet. The paper cups were not replaced so we couldn't make a drink. We paid 3 times as much to stay in Caesars Palace as we did to stay in Harrah's and the room in Harrah's was so much better. I will not stay again.
30,The check in girl didnt let us know that theres a mini bar and if you touch anything on top of it or in it they will charge your card $75.00!!! We just needed to put our food in the fridge to keep it cold so we took out a few beers and energy drinks and set them on top of fridge and were going to put them back afterwards so they charged us for the items removed!! went down to explain what happened after someone in our business meeting let us know about the charges that they received because their kids touched the items also!!! We settled the dispute except for the $75.00 that she said she could do nothing about but gave us a food voucher of $50.00 but at least had to charge us $25.00??the other ladies that i roomed with spoke up and said that was fair enough but it wasnt our mistake it was the front desk..so just be careful if you go there!
40,Two complaints: toilet seat was loose and almost ready to fall off. No free coffee in the room? You can get this at any motel/hotel in the world. The setup for Chinese new year was fantastic. Beautiful property and the staff was great.
20,I didn‚Äôt realize until the last night of my 3 night stay at Ceasars Palace when I pulled the covers further back that there was blood in 6 different places on my sheets- and that wasn‚Äôt from me! Absolutely disgusting!!    I mentioned to a member at the front desk that I had an upset that I would like to talk with someone about but also stated I didn‚Äôt have time to wait in the long line check in line (12 people) as I had to head to the airport. She said I would have to wait in line or post it online. Doesn‚Äôt seem like the smartest decision for them but here it is. I now have serious reservations about staying there again especially from their response
30,Doing an overnight stay to see George Strait. Made the mistake of booking a room at Caesar‚Äôs Palace. You will pay extra for everything‚Ä¶  We arrived at noon and IF we wanted an early check-in it was additional $75 bucks plus the $50 +\- ‚ÄúResort Fee‚Äù on top of your room charge. We had to use a third party booking company to get a much lower rate than the Caesar‚Äôs reservations booking could offer. We save over $ 580 dollars by NOT using their reservation line.  You will pay!
10,Arrived late on Friday to find the line to check in taking up the entire lobby. 1 1/2 hrs later managed to check in only to be told no king beds tough luck should have read the small print. We don‚Äôt guarantee what you booked so it‚Äôs $53 resort fee and $30 to park your car. They also charged my card $75 which they couldn‚Äôt tell me what for and it took 2 weeks to get back
40,We love Caesars Palace. They have a lot of refurbishment going on in the lobby area but it is still worth staying there. Diamond and Seven Stars have their own area to check in. Eric was great to work with in VIP Check In. He went out of his way to help us with a situation. We always appreciate customer service like he provided. Caesars will always be one of our favorite places to stay in Vegas.
10,We booked a suite and connecting king room. Rooms were not very nice. We spent a lot of money in the suite and it was crappy and run down. The whole resort needs a facelift and renovations. Our rooms especially were really dated. We expected much more for an expensive suite. Caesars charged us a late check out for both rooms. $30 for one and $60 for the suite. We left at 6:00 am to catch an early flight out. We disputed the charges and the person said housekeeping said the rooms were still occupied at noon which is a lie. We used a coffee pod and were charged $20.00. There was a misc television charge of $19.99 that did not belong to us. Pool was closed and parts of resort closed and we were charged a large daily resort fee. It took 65 minutes to wait in line and check in BECAUSE we had a suite. If we didn‚Äôt then there could have been express check in. Caesars sucks and recommend staying anywhere else. Circus Circus would be bette than what Caesars had become.
20,Positive: Saved $300 with Hotels.com Rewards used. Negative: When we were there we were charged an extra $50 per day resort fee by the hotel. No free coffee for the k-cup. No microwave. The fridge was stocked with soda beer and alcohol. No room for anything we would want to put in. The top of the fridge had snacks. There was sensors to see if you took anything. If you wanted to use the fridge for personal use it would cost $75. No hand map so we got lost alot our first two days.
40,Pictures looked more luxurious it‚Äôs price is competing with some of the more luxury hotels and better up to date rooms. Nothing special with service everyone seemed rushed at front desk even though we went at low season and were the only ones checking in at late night.
30,We were excited to stay at Caesar's Palace but we're really underwhelmed at the experience. Everything was just okay from the quality of the room to the friendliness of the staff to the softness of the towels. We did not get the type of room we requested which was disappointing. On top of everything there were many people in the (long) line to check in that were not wearing face masks and the staff seemed very unconcerned despite signage everywhere indicating that masks were required.
40,everything was good except that they tried to charge us for ‚Äúusing‚Äù the mini refrigerator! which i think they should mention that during the check in or have a bigger sign. we took 3 kids and they explore the fridge opened and they said we moved the stuff which we didn‚Äôt. just something for you guys to check do not even touch it!!! u will see a lot of charges there.
30,I love Las Vegas so it was great to be back  The hotel staff were all great and helpful when needed but it was a little disappointing in and around the hotel due to the amount of renovation going on during our stay.  Overall would come back - but hopefully once the building works were clear and getting around was less of a challenge!
20,My family and I were so excited to have a comp room at Caesars Palace within the last couple of days. We had a room in the Octavius Tower but was upgraded to the Augustus at check in. We had a very long day of travel and was very exhausted so we were very grateful for how easy check in was. Everything was so nice and clean we thought. We found an open condemn on the darn nightstand behind the lamp! How disgusting! That means we had to wait another 30 minutes to get someone to come up and re clean the entire room and change sheets and towels and wipe down everything once again. so you could only imagine how my family felt after traveling from Maryland. Then on top of that on the way home after check out I notice that I was billed for taking something out of the mini bar that I made sure that we did not use so I will be fighting that charge as well. So not sure if I will ever be staying at this property again.
20,I will rate this from 1 to 5 and trust me I'm being generous due to the experience I have had at their hotel in Atlantic City.    Hospitality is a 1: I have never booked a place and then been told they would downgrade me. I had a room booked for the Octavius Tower which they tried moving me to the Julius standard room. Luckily and unfortunately I spoke with a manager who made the accommodations to get me in the Augustus room. Waiting online for hours for rewards and check-in is definitely not a welcoming feeling.    The Casino Floor is a 1: For me coming from the east coast I was rating this place from their other place in AC which this place falls short on so many levels. If you play slots you will be better off playing at the arcade as you would get more playtime than I did here along with not being served a drink after dropping $400 is a rip off this place really took the cake. They need what they have in AC where you can call for beverage service because i have seen like 4 serving girls the whole time I was here and that is currently 4 nights going on 5.    Sights and Room is a 4: It really is beautiful I will give it that from the location to the rooms only reason it's not a 5 is cuz I have seen their lack in some areas including HVAC cleaning where the vent in my room was completely disgusting without even a filter but other than some cleanliness issues you will get what you expect with the roman theme here and it is amazing.    Price is a 1: I get it you are in Ceasars but again hospitality has to meet the bar if you're going to overprice on everything. Seriously flies in Gordan Pub and Grill to nasty service people going to the buffet for $80 a person why the hell is everything either overcooked like the brisket and prime rib to lobster claws nowhere near fresh yeah you are in a buffet but it $80 when 3 years before it was around 40 so unless they plan to go back to that price it's not worth it go to hells kitchen and please stop overrating these places people this type of service is only going to get worse if you are complacent with this type of service.    Overall it is a 2 and that is just because I really love Caesar's Theme this place needs competition as it shows they don't care about their customers. They need a beverage ordering system and they need to boost the hospitality for me this will be definitely the last time I come to this location and spend as much as I did. It is up to others to truly look at what you are paying and if this meets your standards then we are not made of the same cloth.
40,Visited this hotel as part of a wedding party - what a fantastic day setting drinks food flowers decor casino and ceremony. How has shops beautiful decor with statues pool cocktails and staff. Everything was perfect and would definitely return!
30,The room was nice checking checkout was super great. The breakfast place off lobby was waaaay over priced. $26. For pancakes!! Cold breakfast cost the two of us $100. No cocktails. That is terrible to treat guest that way. Other restaurants were nice. But cafe should have reasonably priced food for families to enjoy!
10,I stayed at Caesars Palace Las Vegas on the 16th of October as an invited guest on a comped room. As I had arrived earlier I was asked to leave my credit card for the security deposit. I was of the understanding that the security deposit would only be taken if the room was damaged. I don¬¥t check my bank statements often but I was going through transactions when I realised they had not returned the charge on my credit card.    I sent an email explaining the situation and they claimed that the charge was not a security deposit but a payment for the room. I sent them proof that the room was comped and that the casino host had added one of us as a guest.  They then replied that disputes can¬¥t be taken past 90 days and that I should reach out to the host to assist. Well I have no contact with the host since I am just an invited guest so I basically have no recourse. This is a horrible policy that I am sure customers are not even aware of.    This is unacceptable customers should not be penalized for the hotel¬¥s errors. I can¬¥t imagine how many others have had extra charges on their cards that they haven¬¥t realized.
10,Stood there for 3 days and I found the best thing was the Bachannel Buffet to be the highlight of the stay. The rooms are outdated and have no USB outlets. The directions inside the hotel are not good.
40,Property was well maintenances with a lot of details But the parking fee $30 per day is too expensive for nothing. The exit gates are not working well. So there was a lot of traffic congestion due to the cars being pushed back.
20,Horrible experience which bookended an otherwise great time in Vegas. First they screw up our reservations so we end up on the opposite end of the property from our friends and then they try to apply parking charges for the entire stay when we rented a car for a day trip (which we were clear about) and then proceeded to argue with me about it while placing me on hold for extended periods. Incompetence negligence outright fraudulence... whatever the reason it's best you stay someplace else. Only reason it doesn‚Äôt get a ‚Äúterrible‚Äù rating is that the room was as described.
30,Caesar‚Äôs has slipped It‚Äôs tired and worn. The main entrance/lobby renovations and lack of signage made for a confusing check in. Twice our keys had to be reprogrammed. The room was tired soft bed scratched furniture worn couch and carpet with a few stains. The towels were soft and plush.  Staff were friendly some more helpful than others. We hope the current renovations are completed quickly so they can move on to renovate the rooms.
10,Did not yet visit but STAY AWAY FROM THIS !!! I'm planning a trip on Tuesday the 8th of February. Booked it two weeks in advance and since then their marketing tools are sending me daily messages about so-called offers. I guess they need to make some more money elsewhere since Adele cancelled her show. Really this has never happened to me before but I'm starting to think that I ended up on the list of one of the most active spammers in North America. When asked to stop via mail no response. I guess all server capacity is reserved for customer harassment. Dear people at 'the palace' : if you care to read this would you please stop sending me those mails and also consider asking your customers about it before ? In these times of COVID I want to be treated as a king in your palace not just like some cow that spits out money and then leaves !
10,"This was my husband's birthday trip and our 3rd trip to Vegas. We have always stayed at Aria but decided to try out Cesars. I suggest not doing it!! Problems from the beginning! Checked into our room the ""double"" shower only has hot water on one side and cold on the other and ""newly renovated"" tub had a spray wand that didn't work at all. Went down to front desk to let them know it was then 12 hours later that someone shows up to fix only to be told they couldn't and wouldn't swap us rooms.  On the 3rd of Feb (my husband's birthday) we had reservations to Homestead. We were told to charge it to the room and it would be Comp'd for the inconvenience. Instead they charged our credit card at check out and no one knows what to do or say.  Also was charged over $100 for Valet when I am a Diamond Rewards Member??  Customer service is horrible they just don't care."
50,The third one is the winner! Nice people and clean place! After a failure in 2 other hotels this ones was the good one when I check in the woman was so nice my room had a nice view it was clean and we had a good experience that change our mood and luck üçÄ gambling was good. I really recommend this place 100%
30,We booked this hotel for‚Ä¶ well it‚Äôs ‚ÄúCaesar‚Äôs Palace‚Äù! Looking for the ultimate hotel experience when in actuality it is simply a nice hotel with a ton of money grab options. The hotel itself has lovely shops and architecture but the room is just average. Struggled to even get a coffee maker brought in and they didn‚Äôt supply coffee in the room without charging $5 a cup! Restaurants are incredibly expensive and no spa or gym available without taking out a loan for the daily fee.  We‚Äôll go back to Vegas but we will not go back to this hotel.
10,Always wanted to stay at this Beautiful Mega hotel. Went for my Birthday midweek and sooo disappointed and won‚Äôt go back or recommend to anyone.  First in was the most difficult and impersonal experience at checkin in. Treated like cattle not like guests with money to spend and special requests. Room given nothing better than a budget road hotel. Towels sheets mattress ventilation and amenities all uncomfortable. Not anything we would have expected from this place. Also wrongly charged for a movie rental never made!  Phone system trying to get service of any kind frustrating to say the least.    Reasonable price good food choices were not available and the few places we did eat at this place were not good for service taste or prices.  Covid protocols minimal. Parking fees for guests insulting and difficult to navigate.    As you can tell there was nothing memorable or pleasant staying here. We were anxious to leave this place as soon as possible and not leave any more of our money here. We‚Äôve been to many hotels on the Las Vegas strip at all price points and never felt so unhappy with so many things then at this hotel.    Definitely don‚Äôt recommend staying here. Go only if you want to walk the massive maze of Forum shops for upscale overpriced luxury stores. And be prepared with comfortable shoes cause walking endlessly will be a must to navigate this place even to get to the Las Vegas Blvd to get out of the hotel to explore.
20,"This is my 5th trip to Vegas in 6 years and my first stay at Caesar's. I was excited to stay there since I had heard so much about it as a ""luxury"" property. If you are going to spend the money Caesar's charges you I highly recommend you go to another property (Bellagio Aria and Palazzo are all much nicer and similarly priced). I was disappointed by the condition of my room the lack of amenities and the level of customer service.    First the room was filthy. The couch had actual dark brown stains. The wallpaper had stains all over it. The shower smelled like mildew. There was a former guest's clothing tag under the vanity that was not cleaned prior to my stay. There was a glass lamp that had an inside filled with dust. There were hairs on my bed linen that were not mine. The area where the carpet met the tiled hallway was tattered and raggedy. The furniture was all scratched and dented. I could go on but you get the point.    I was doing some work and expected the usual notepad and pen by the phone to jot down some notes. There was no pen no notepad no slippers no robe. etc. Even a Marriott would have a notepad. I was surprised that this level of hotel did not have these items.    Finally the service was terrible. I arrived on a six-hour flight and the room was not ready at 2:30 but could be if I paid another $45. This is a scam and a tacky attempt to extort more money from guests. When my room was ready I waited in a 1/2 hour line to get my keys. I walked the long walk with all my bags to my room only to find out my room key did not work. They were going to send security to open the room but after waiting at my door for another 1/2 hour no one came. I then had to gather all of my bags again and take the long walk back through the casino wait another 1/2 hour in line again then get my key. The front desk staff were unpleasant.    Caesar's was probably a very nice hotel when it was new but since it was built so many much nicer properties have opened on the strip. I prefer the Bellagio for its location and amenities and the Palazzo for its incredibly nice and large rooms. I recommend these (or Aria which is also nice clean and new) over Caesar's any day. I will not be going back."
10,Our taxi was turned around and we were not allowed to use main entrance as it was apparently only for premium customers. Instead we were dropped in the garage. After 15 min of walking we finally made it to the reception only to be told at 3.05pm that they will charge $45 for an early check in. Seeing the room was ready and we were 55 min early.. To charge that much is ridiculous. The lady at reception was rude beyond. After a 12h flight this was not the welcome we expected. We also booked a fountain view room. We ended up on top of motorway.. By standing on tippy toes we managed to see the fountain. We won't return.
10,Go anywhere else. I was given a room in the Forum Tower. All the furniture was damaged/scratched up. The shower didn't work properly. They wouldn't give me a new room without charging me WAY more money. Sent an engineer to fix the shower. Took over 2 hours for a simple 30 second valve change. The showerheads looked like they hadn't been cleaned in months. And I didn't sleep because of my dust/mold allergy. Dust/dirt was built up into all the vents and smoke alarm. I'm totally disgusted with this hotel.
30,We stayed at Caesars in a suite 2 1/2 years ago and the room was nice . The bed and pillows were so comfortable. The only issue was they charged us for 3 room drinks that we didn't touch or drink and wouldn't give a refund. We stayed Jan. 23  2022 for 3 nights. I didn't know I had booked 2 adjoining rooms from a third party site reservations.com. When I went to check in they told me the rooms were in 2 different towers and couldn't guarantee adjoining rooms. So I asked how much more for a suite. He called the manager and they said they would remove $100 off each room and no resort fees for an extra $850 on top of what I already paid to reservations.com. I agreed then a week later I saw my bank statement and saw I was charged the resort fees. Since the front desk guy didn't put it in the notes they won't refund me. The room this time didn't even compare to the suite we stayed in last time . The beds and pillows weren't comfortable and the shower drain kept backing up. So bottom line I won't stay at Caesars again. Definitely wasn't worth what I paid.
20,I really wanted to love it here. However we were not impressed with the check in process kiosk. Although there was someone there it was still confusing. If the hotel is trying to cut down on staff due to covid so should the overpriced rates. The hotel is a mad house with little or no security. It did not make us feel safe at all. Please hire staff!
10,Booked hotel Cesar Palace to Adele and hotel failed to meet expectations and price.    Don‚Äôt wake up your guest if not requested to do so.    Will never stay here again. Will go and pay elsewhere that respects my money and time.
10,Cesar Palace lost our loyalty. House keeping knocked at our door 3 mornings in a row. We did not have a need for cleaning and we didn‚Äôt feel a do not disturb was needed if their intent was not to clean - then why bother patrons to knock in the morning and loudly with an annoying knob so it‚Äôs loud. We stayed for four (4) days and three (3) nights - clearly if you want is gone in the morning of our last day - at least do it that morning but not all mornings. Some of us do go to have fun and relax. Just rude - again.    We booked for Adele and to watch Banda on Friday. However we stayed true to Cesar‚Äôs Palace because of Adele and even though we did not have the show for the week prior. A five (5%) percent or 10% on her merchandise could have been offered to us for the loyalty of going when we just asked. However when we did ask the actions of the manager was just sad by stating to us - ‚Äúyou had last week to cancel but thanks for coming anyway‚Äù - could have sounded and accommodating us could have happened differently.  Even a free drink on us would have been appropriate considering they we the hosting venue. Plus - the manager then later stated ‚Äúit was Adele at fault and if and when she decides to come‚Äù how rude was that. So her showroom signature is a fake? - which made me more upset because the fault is not Adele if again Cesar‚Äôs is the hosting venue.    Thirdly the Internet was junk and the TV was not working. When I called I was informed they were wiki g on the issues but it took 5 hours before it finally did but didn‚Äôt matter by then. Just had to miss my emails and the news for that morning.    When we did call for room service - no one came and had to call back. If the intent was not to comply with the request due to staff shortages or a later time - then it should just be said and not implied that it will and doesn‚Äôt after 4 hours. That is just rude. This given the fact we had our light indicator- requesting maid service.    The food app was horrible as not all items that can be added to the menu were and the options was limited. Ideally should not be offered especially when internet is down and a phone order is not even an option.    The bathroom furniture was damaged badly scuffed or cracked mirror on the drawer - that aesthetically can be fixed and isn‚Äôt. Making the gorgeous restroom look cheap and worn down.    The hotel itself did not have enough machines to play - especially quarters. Have more on the floor to keep patrons there to enjoy. Lastly - if restaurants are closed or limited to staff or food selections. Just offer a return visit for the inconvenience but don‚Äôt book knowing you booked with a limited menu.    Lastly it was never informed that the pool was out. That was the icing on the cake - knowing Wynn and the Bellagio had a working pool.    I hope people do rate this hotel right because I have stayed here a million times over but this time I was in extremely disappointed and it should not have the ratings it does.
10,caesars palace is a case study in purposely bad customer service. its really unbelievable. the fact they have a poorly thought iut renovation in place is not the issue. from the very beginning every step is designed to minimize cost and instill a pack mentality. check in is understaffed and incompetent. they have no idea which room is which. When you have room issues and you will you cannot contact anyone who can help on a phone. those people appear to not be on site if you can get someone... the rooms are dark dirty and everything from lights to phones dont work i was promised a house credit. nope not there at check out. and only 3 people working the desk with 20 customers in line. we could chalk it all up to Covid if everyone there didnt clearly NOT care just awful
50,We had some confusion with our room and we went down to ask to fix it and Macy and Jasmine couldn't have been more helpful or accommodating. We really did appreciate it. The rooms were also very clean and nice.
50,Just a quick thank you to Caesar‚Äôs Palace - stayed this weekend with a big group and it was a blast. Room perfect and Emma our host was simply amazing everything was flawlessly taken care of - if you are looking to book a trip with a group of friends and family you must find Emma and stay at Caesar‚Äôs Palace.    I‚Äôve never written a review before but had to for this one our stay was that good.
50,I am an avid visitor of Caesar‚Äôs and always have an awesome time. This weekend was nothing different. Emma Martin always provides us excellent customer service the rooms are clean (Palace Tower) and the staff take care of their visitors. Can‚Äôt wait for our next visit ‚ù§Ô∏è
20,paid months in advance for rooms and when checked in had no rooms had to give us rooms we did not want. never gave a refund difference. was suppose to call us the next day to change rooms but did't. . had always wanted to stay there and really liked the rest of the place but was very disappointed in our rooms. they were not cleaned very well..
50,Great suite with jacuzzi tub and view. Room is very clean comfortable bed with couch area. Pedicure at the hotel spa was top notch! Service with Emma is extremely accommodating and she‚Äôs so kind and helpful! Definitely would stay again!
10,Terrible customer service. Didn't comp anything per previous visits. Host was unavailable and not accommodating. Was charged full price despite bringing a group of 10 and logging over 30 hours at 100avg. Trash appreciation. Avoid at all costs. Every single other casino rewards their players better
50,Christina provided amazing customer service while checking in for a business conference! Things were very busy at the time of check in and she was professional and very friendly. She definitely made our hotel stay a wonderful experience.
10,My stay at Caesars palace was less than what I could imagine for this to be one of the top-rated hotels on the last Vegas strip. This resort seemed like the worse hotel to me and I've stayed at a lot of them . From the time of checking in to room 493 it was a disaster. The Julius towers was so run down walls chipping and the hallways had carpet stains. This room was supposedly an upgraded room according to the front desk. I called and spoke with Charles in guest services and he instructed me to come down to the front desk for a room change. I then spoke with Dwight at guest services and he was very friendly and apologetic. I then was upgraded to the palace tower to room 1524 where I entered a room that was dirty. The room had dirt stains all over the sheets like they hadn‚Äôt been cleaned. I then call guest services again where I spoke with Georgina and she said that she would remove the resort fees for that night since we had experienced such a hassle. She noted that she would send housekeeping to change the sheets and that we would have to remain in the same room. I went back down to speak with Dwight about a room change. He then moved me into a different room in the palace towers; Finally a CLEAN room. The morning of checkout the resort fees were still attached to the ending balance and the lady at the front desk told us that there wasn‚Äôt a note left from Georgina to remove the resort fees for the first night so there was nothing that she could do. After insisting on speaking with a manager they finally removed one night of the resort fees. All in all I would NEVER stay at this hotel again. The hassle of getting a clean room and them keeping their word to accommodate guest as they said they would shouldn‚Äôt have never happened. The complete process of staying at this hotel and paying resort fees was not worth the money.
30,"This is going to be a bit of a long review. I would overall give Caesars Palace 2.5 out of 5 stars so I will round up to 3. To preface this review: I am a Caesars Diamond member and the last time I stayed at Bally's (my usual go-to in town) I received a very nice upgrade to a whirlpool suite.    We stayed in Vegas for three nights this trip. The first night was spent at Bellagio in a standard king room which was fabulous - I booked through the myVegas app as a reward and we only paid the $50 resort fee.    Originally I had booked Paris for the remaining two nights but a friend talked me in to Caesars and it was only $68 for two nights for a standard King room. When we were about to check out of Bellagio on Monday morning CP sent me an online check-in link. Perfect we could avoid the front lobby check-in. It offered me two different rooms for an upgrade which was really nice so I thought ... one was the Palace Tower studio suite which looked fabulous so I chose that one. I *believe* the other was a Julius Tower room but I'm not 100% certain on that.    When we arrived at CP we did express check-in at one of the kiosks and it said we were in a Julius Tower room. We arrived at our room (#366 3rd floor) and were very disappointed. The room was about half the size of the Bellagio room - but even if you were to compare it to a standard Bally's or Paris room it was still lacking. The bathroom only had a shower (no bathtub) and was also very small. We were also confused because with mobile check-in it seemed like we would be receiving a Palace Tower suite.    We dragged our luggage back downstairs and headed to the Diamond check-in area. I luckily had a screenshot of the Palace Tower offer which I showed the Diamond room employee and she went to confer with her boss. She came back and said that when upgrades are offered like that it usually means there is an upcharge and I had not completed mobile check-in (obviously I had otherwise how would we have received the Julius room?) so therefore it hadn't shown me the prices. She said that normally the rooms go for $150/n but she could do the upgrade for $100/n. We were pretty disappointed in the Julius room - which apparently was already a complimentary upgrade in which case I wouldn't want to see what a standard King room looks like at CP! - so we decided to go for it.    Here's the good part: even though we had to pay an extra $225-ish or so (with taxes) for two nights our room (#2740 Palace Tower) was pretty spectacular although I will say the Bellagio room was overall nicer. It was a gigantic room with a pool view and it had TWO bathrooms - the first one had a jacuzzi bath regular toilet plus bidet and a two-person shower which connected to the second bathroom which had the shower a sink and a toilet area. Pretty awesome that we each had our own bathroom. The king-sized bed was also comfortable and the couch area was nice as well.    Cons however: there was no regular fridge only a minibar same as Bellagio - in the Diamond check-in area the employee did ask me if I needed a fridge due to medical reasons but I said no as I don't have any medical reasons for this trip (I have Crohn's but no meds need to be refrigerated).    Another con: we had no housekeeping for our 2-night stay. To be transparent: I left the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on our door on Tuesday AM but we left the room by 12pm which is still pretty early.    When we checked out on Wednesday I asked for an itemized bill as I was pretty sure Caesars would screw it up and it's a good thing I did ... Caesars had offered me $50 off the suite due to the miscommunication (I DMed them on Twitter and one of their reps then called me) and that was not on the bill. The front desk person did accommodate and take the $50 off but had I done express checkout I probably would have had an issue getting them to do that.    So the TL;DR for Caesars ... if you are going to stay here definitely do not book a regular Forum Tower or Julius room as they are tiny and not great (you'll get more bang for your buck at Bally's or even Paris). However I would give the Palace Tower studio suite room a solid 4.5/5 stars and that is why Caesars gets 3 stars from me in this review and not 2 stars."
40,Upon arrival The concierge was outstanding. As I entered the room I noticed I was staying in the Julius room and not the forum room I ordered. I was tired from travel and was content with it regardless. The next day there was a malfunction with the toilet though. I then asked the room cleaner for help. He responded for me to call concierge. Only to head back into the room and noticed the phone didn't work either. I went back out and told the gentleman who nicely called his manager to get things resolved. The maintenance man came within 2 hours and an IT TECH fella not to far after that. Everything was resolved sorta quickly but felt doomed in this room. The rest of the stay was nice. Comfortable bed and nice view of the strip. Sunday evening I was gonna eat at the bacchanal buffet. Upon walking by it was very quiet. I was told to qr code reservation by employee's. While having difficulties in front of staff and trying on the website too. I got irritated and just left. I'll spend my money elsewhere and went to wynn buffet instead. Bummer because I've heard good things about the bacchanal. Oh well
10,I have always wanted to celebrate my 50th in Las Vegas and in my mind the best hotel to stay in was Caesar‚Äôs palace. When booking this trip along with tickets to see Celina Dion I could not be happier. On arrival to Caesar‚Äôs palace I was immediately hit with a vile smell of cigarettes and marijuanna. Once checked in we where allocated room 869 in julius tower. What a disgrace and absolute insult to be allocated this room. On entering the accommodation the strong and pungent smell of tobacco and marijuanna was overwhelming along with the threadbare carpet with wet damp patches bed covers with noticeable stains on an incomplete minibar along with no robes or fresh towels to acknowledge a new guests arrival. On trying to report these problems I was advised it could take up to 24hrs to rectify. A very disappointing start to my bday celebrations
30,The entrance was under construction so it was weird be dropped off by Uber at the back and a long walk to check in. The room was clean but they didn't provide any Sanitizer wipes for you to clean off things like the remote or switches. Even though the rooms are non smoking they still have an odor to them. The clock in the room didn't work hair dryer didn't work. replacement hair dryer was delivered the clock was never fixed or replaced.
10,"Absurdly long check-in/out lines. I can only imagine how many people get hit with the early check-in fee even though it's a tourist spot where everyone flies in throughout the whole day.    Dreadful wi-fi & cell service throughout.    Between noon & 7 PM local time on my third night (Jan 22nd) my room was robbed. They stole my Chromebook brand new Braun Series 9 razor and Sony bluetooth headphones. Almost a grand worth of possessions. The over priced in room items & mini-bar were picked through also. My room was on the 13th floor of the Julius tower where this kind of thing apparently ""Doesn't happen."" Security was absolutely useless even though I gave them the specific time I was gone from the room. Then when I went back to check with them on progress the same two guys I talked to acted like they didn't remember me. They wanted *me* to call the police station instead of them or being of any assistance at all. I filled out a guest statement but this many days later nothing has happened. When I checked out the most I got was my Resort ""fee's"" and early check in fee wiped. There was an overwhelming sense of a lack of empathy or any interest in resolving this from everyone I tried to get help from.    The one positive I'll note is that the table games were by far the most fun as all of the dealers were nice and friendly and were on point to keep smokers away from the tables.    I will not be staying here again so if you do put your valuables (only the tiny ones since the safe is miniature.) in the safe."
40,We stay there over new years. Once we arrived and we checked in. We had a room booked strip view. The guy checking us in told us he could upgrade our room to the Palace tower and it was bigger. We had never stayed at Caesars before. So we agreed. However the room did NOT have a strip view. It had a pool view and highway view. The room had a fridge but was FULLY stocked of beverages. So no where to put your medicine or drinks or leftovers. Nor does it have a microwave. They also do not have one to bring you during your stay. So that was very annoying. The bathroom was huge. Jack and Jill style and it was 4 of us so that was a plus. The room was very clean. Room service was quick. Pretty long walk to get to lobby though. I would stay here again but another tower.
50,She is always so nice she is always there for me.  My complaint is for the house keeping I call every day to bring my coffee set and she never did. And the one who is on charge of the refill from the bar service never didn‚Äôt too!!!
40,First time staying here - had a lovely time!    Very appreciative of getting upgraded check in AND being able to check in early. Lovely room. Didn't love the empty cigarette carton in our room by one of the beds when we first walked in.
10,The rooms were dirty . I paid for all rooms in advance . We we arrived they had given our rooms to someone else and then downgraded our rooms after they took our money . The remotes in our room were broke rooms were dirty . We were treated horribly. Their people even delayed our wedding
10,Unbelievable lack of compassion and consideration for people who flew in for the Adele Residency. I was in the air to Vegas when it was canceled and was unable to get another flight out when I landed. I told the clerk when I checked in about it and was offered nothing  not even an apology. To make matters worse- I was put in a filthy room next to an ice machine and employee closet which was extremely loud day and night. My response form caesars was that I could of canceled without penalties when I heard it was canceled. Too bad I had already landed in Vegas. This was a residency heavily sponsored by Caesars. I revieved no response about the dirty room and have been offered no future stay discounts or even the resort fee knocked off the $600 I spent staying there for a show that didn't happen. Awful.
50,Caesars Palace has some of the best signature restaurants on the strip. The suite I stay in was very well cleaned and the bed/mattress was extremely comfortable. The only bad thing that happen was Adele canceling her show at the last minute. Not Cool!
40,Stayed here for a sales conference in Jan. 2022. Loved the room. Hated the minibar. Prices are outrageous and the snacks are top are just torture. $16 for 10 Oreos so sleazy and greedy. Resort is good and rooms good. Caesars just gouges you on every single thing else!
40,The room and all indoor areas where Comfortably clean I have high standards for cleanliness. The staff was friendly and very accommodating. The indoor lighting throughout the hotel was exceptional with a sense of feeling safe. Even the self parking was well lid. I enjoyed walking the Casino and multiple indoor shopping areas. Very unique!
20,Soap dish in shower was tilted and falling off toilet paper hanger was broken paper roll kept falling to floor. Housekeeping kept missing my room one day house keeping opened and drank half new bottle fireball complaint filed with security. Bed was worn not comfortable can tell where everyone always sits bed sink in on side. Box spring had wear holes visible on side Room 2615 Caesar‚Äôs tower
40,The room was gorgeous and so was the view. The only downside was the mile long walk from parking to the room. Parking valet or self parking was literally at the other end of the building and Caesars is HUGE! Asked to switch to a different tower closer to parking and was told the room would be a significant downgrade so we didn't do that. Would not stay here again solely based on the horrendous walking distance. Have to give 5 stars though because everything was top notch.
10,Stay Away This place is a joke ..... I don't feel safe here. Gangsters have taken over Caesars. It not the Caesars I remember. I am staying at WYNN next time. That is that. There is noone around this joint with any class anymore. That is just that.
10,Our trip to the hotel started out as what we had hoped would be an amazing weekend starting with tonight when we were to see Weekends with Adele that we learned was cancelled in the middle of our travel from Southwest Florida to Las Vegas yesterday and was the primary reason for booking at this hotel. However upon getting settled in last night we discovered that our room was not allowing for any cell service and the internet was down. When we called customer support and did as they asked but to no avail they upgraded us to IT who said they had a ticket in and knew about the issue but could not tell us when it would be fixed. So I let it go till morning since I had work to do today and went downstairs to speak to a manager who assured me they were working on it but when I return several hours later to find out it was still down they informed me that the service provider was on site but could not offer any updates so we left again and returned several more hours later and still no service. Now keep in mind that internet service is included in that outrageous resort fee they are charging you for and the best they had to offer was that they would refund the resort fee. When I went online to Hotels.com and saw that the rooms I had paid $399.00 for was $152. it further enraged my disappointment with this hotel and the management don't even get me start at the lack of accountability to satisfy an angry guest at this point Dwight and Allison really didn't care about the customer experience at all! No gold standard here! They have no guest services or concierge if you want to speak to someone you wait in line with all of the check in and check out guest. Needless to say we checked out early also a very poor experience and moved to The Venetian which offered a much different customer experience more in line with what we expected from Caesar's. See photos below of the view in our $399 room. It is my mission to ensure that other travelers don't have a similar experience.
50,I arrived during a very busy check in time after a long flight. I was having trouble with my phone and accessing the documents I required. The wonderful woman Zandra who was assisting me with check in went out of her way to help me. She was understanding and kind. She made my arrival seem less. Caesars Palace should have more employees like Zandra.
30,The room was nice. Pillows not that comfortable though. What they didn‚Äôt tell us at booking or check in is that while there is a fridge and Kurig machine you have to pay $75 to put anything in the fridge and you have to buy k-cups from the mini bar‚Ä¶  You would think that for the price of the hotel (and upgrade) they would not nickel and dime you for everything else. And I know that Vegas is pricy but $60 -$75 with tip for 2 breakfasts ( 2 eggs meat and toast) and coffee really surprised me.    We will not be staying here again.
40,Enjoyed our short say here. Booked an Augustus suite and got upgraded to a Bellagio fountain view room which was awesome. Room was huge and very comfortable and in a good part of hotel with elevators not far from entry and reception area. Only downside was that the pool area was entirely closed and you couldn't even walk around there. Would have been nice to at least keep some hot tubs and the are aopen to walk around. Resort fees are also excessive especially as you couldn't access the pool area!
30,Stayed at Ceasars Palace in January of 2022 Requested a mini fridge for medication and it was never delivered The king size mattress had a king size divot in it and the water pressure in the shower was non existent We found stuff on the floor from the previous occupants of the room. First time staying at a Ceasars property usually stay at MGM property. will go back to MGM property.
50,Zandra at the front desk was absolutely AMAZING!! She was so efficient extremely friendly and eager to answer all our questions. She even gave us an upgrade on our room to make sure we had the best stay we can have. 10/10 recommend Zandra and caesars palace. Room was amazing too!
50,I had a wonderful time at Caesars Palace. The staff were friendly and accommodating. I upgraded my room for very little money and the room was very spacious and clean. My very expensive necklace fell from my neck without my knowledge. When I inquired with security if it had been found the security officer returned it to me. We went to the Usher concert which was excellent. Overall I highly recommend this hotel.
50,Landed in Las Vegas on 1/9/22 with my daughter. It was like pulling teeth to get her to go but she did. My room wasn't ready after 30 minutes after check- in. The gentleman near the kiosk asked if he could help. He upfront is to a better room. Lived the room. Would definitely book the palace tower next time. Best part of the room was the comfortable bed and the jacuzzi tub. Engen though we weren't in the room very to sleep and shower still lived the room. It was clean and convenient to everything. World book tj palace tower the next trip. She had a great time and wants to go again. So worth the trip.
10,This was my wife and I first time staying at Caesar‚Äôs Palace with great hopes for the Hotel. Upon entering the Hotel we quickly realized that it is extremely dated and very dirty. The entire hotel smelled like marijuana and was filthy. We went into our room only to find that it was the same filth as the rest of the hotel the bathroom was not cleaned at all and the shower floor was very dirty. We were woken up at 6am to an extremely loud vibration sound coming from the ventilation system that was so loud we could not fall back asleep. We immediately went to the front desk to speak to a manager who did comp the room but never offered any further assistance. We cancelled our additional night reservation and left the hotel immediately we will not return to Caesar‚Äôs and do not recommend this resort to anyone. There are many more beautiful resorts to stay at especially the Venitian.
20,Upgrade was not worth it we spent 65 extra per night. Room had terrible view. Leftover food from previous guest found in cupboard complete with bad smell. Blood stain on comforter hair left in sink. We would have told someone in person but checkout had 2 staff working and we waited a long time and barely moved in long line so did express checkout.
40,Over all my stay was pleasant just two issues. 1. Door battery went dead left sitting in the hallway for 45 plus minutes waiting for security and maintenance. 2. The hotel and surrounding areas smell  was getting use to it by the time we left. Everyone was helpful and courteous the whole week. Love the hotel . Thank you for a pleasant stay!!
10,First I want to say‚Ä¶ I did try to contact Caesars Palace to dispute these charges. They make it almost impossible to contact‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve also left a call back message & number 3 times. Never got return anything.    Be very weary about booking this hotel. They nickel and dime you to death with bs resort fees that are per person per day‚Ä¶ also they charge you mini bar fees even though you never touch a dang thing in the mini bar‚Ä¶ and you are charged!    Don‚Äôt even do complimentary coffee in the room‚Ä¶.    Terrible service! You have to beg for clean towels! Then they give you two‚Ä¶ for 3 people in the room!    The Wi-Fi is terrible! We disconnected.    Our next trip we will definitely try a different place!
50,Beautiful and clean property and the staff is so nice and attentive. The sleeping room was clean and spacious. The Casio areas were a little chopped up but still fun. If I had one negative it would be the prices of food. Yes I know it is Vegas but the Venetian has tons of restaurants and they were fairly priced. I am sure they are trying to make-up for lost time but it was a little too much.
10,Besides the poor customer service and being placed in a substandard room we did nothing reserve. We were charged for mini bar items that we did not consume. We were charged 150. For items that we did not use. We did not take any items and were charged 150. And you can‚Äôt get in touch with anyone because Every ONE is trying to call and complain
50,Our group had a great time at Caesars Palace for 4 nights thanks to the excellent service of Sekina McKendell at the front desk. She was extremely welcoming and was able to find our group some great upgrade options. She was very patient with understanding our needs and provided us with various options. Due to the renovations the Forum Tower was the most convenient location for our room as they have moved the uber pickup/drop-off area. Will definitely be returning to Caesars Palace.
20,Checked in at 12am after flight cancellations. Just wanted to shower and go to bed. No shampoo body wash etc.  Called front desk. Waited 20 min. Called back and front desk said they are waiting for a runner and could be another 15 min. I asked if it‚Äôs normal for no toiletries and they said no.    Room also smelled like weed. Overall poor experience.
10,We have always thought Caesar‚Äôs Palace was a cool hotel and we love the forum. So during our planning of all the possible hotels on the strip we decided to treat ourselves and book a strip view room at Caesar‚Äôs. We were disappointed immediately when we received a link to check in and found that if we arrive earlier than their standard 4:00 check in we‚Äôd have to enter a credit card for an extra $50 charge. It didn‚Äôt stop there. If you elect to take a ride share you get dropped off on the exact opposite side of check in and you have to navigate poor signage carpet and people as you drag your bag across the entire casino. Then they checked us into a room that by all accounts was not a strip view but claimed it was because we could see the side of the Treasure Island hotel. The more prominent view was of the freeway and parking garage. Upon elevating the concern via phone we were told we had to go back to the front desk. Despite raising the concerns of again trekking across their building the representative couldn‚Äôt have cared less. Eventually we got the strip view. Sadly this hotel has lost any sense of customer service. For our first experience as guests it was pathetic and one we won‚Äôt repeat. The final straw was the bottom of the barrel toilet paper quality. With so many choices on the strip take your business elsewhere.
50,First time staying at the Caesars Palace and was a great experience. The rooms were really clean and got offered and upgrade when I arrived early for check in. Also got valet parking and the staff was great and brought the car over right away.
10,During my two day stay here the Wi-Fi in my room kept disconnecting the pool was closed off. In addition when I tried to charge a meal to my room I was told that my name was crossed out and had to call to get that sorted out. When checking out I asked the front desk why I was charged for two days of resort fees when I am a diamond status member she gave me false information and told me to go talk to the casino host to see if the resort fees can be waived. The casino host Pauline was very unhelpful and unprofessional kept repeating to me that I don't have any plays and that she cannot help me. Made me feel very unwelcomed when in reality I was only there because I was told to by the front desk. I went to the reward center for help Shawn and Christopher were extremely helpful. Shawn even walked me to someone who could help me. In the end it was Danny who fixed the problem for me. All these unnecessary run around costed about two hours of my trip and made my stay very unpleasant.
20,Stayed in Caesers Forum Tower. Room was about Best Western grade. Furnature was beaten up Coffee maker provided but no coffee! Charged for mini-bar M&M's at $16 but never had them. Carpet had seen better days.  Arrived by Shuttle bus from Airport but the drop off was as far from the check-in as you could get due to renovations - had to drag bags 1/2 mile although cabs and Limos were allowed to use the front drop off! Charged $51 per night for resort fee although Pool was shut and Wi-Fi not required.  Bed was comfortable.  Priority should have been on upgrading the rooms before a new entrance!
30,Stayed in the forum tower and when I stepped into the room it felt like I was in the Excalibur. The room was an average to below average room and I expected better for my first stay at Caesar‚Äôs. The lighting was poor. The desk/table was full of cuts and scuff marks.
40,Going back and forth to your room was very far. Room is very nice.  Mattress could have been firmer.  Place is under renovation. Should be told upfront under construction.  There is a coffee maker in room but no coffee.
10,"We went to check in on 01/10/2022 for a 4 night stay. At 11:30 we first went to the kiosk to check in. It said there was a $50 early check-in fee. I've never been charged early check in in Las Vegas not even at Ceasars Palace especially in January. Decided to wait in the line to talk to the front desk receptionist. We were met with a very rude women. First thing she says is ""it's only noon so do you want to pay the $60 early check in fee?"" Well wait it was $50 a foot away at the kiosk. Tall her no that we don't want to. She says ""you can upgrade and we will waive the fee."" Again told her no we will come back at 4 then.  She then hands me a paper. I thought it said we were declining early check-in. My fiance then says no it is to pay for early check-in. She assured us it was for declining it. I should have known better but we were tired.  I then asked her if we return to the desk to receive our keys at 4. She says ""no is the 18th floor okay? Your room is ready."" Okay so that was odd. Say again we didn't want early check-in and she said ""no your room is ready.""    Get to the room around 1 pm. The room was the same room category we had the year before. The room however was not the same. It only had one toilet vs the 2 separate ones with the walk through shower to each bathroom. The couch was now 1 small chair and the pillows were uncomfortable. The carpets need replaced but seemed clean. Coffee maker with no coffee and one paper cup. Called down to ask if they could bring us some cups (we went to CVS and bought kcups) and they told us they had zero cups in the entire resort. Didn't even offer a regular coffee mug. The next morning we asked housekeeping for some cups and she tells him ""oh no we do t give cups on this floor."" He was like I have a coffee maker. She says ""oh paper cups yes here you go"".    Time for checkout and I'm billed $68.03 for early checkin.  Called and they say "" well yes you were in your room before 4 so you were charged"".    After talking to 3 different people they said a front desk manager would call back and 12 hours later have yet to hear from any one.    The cocktail service was practically non existent except around 10 to midnight in one section of the Forum area. We had one exceptional server. I wish I would have got her name. All other areas it would be hours before someone came by.    This was our second stay at Ceasars Palace and it will be the last. We also stayed 2 nights at MGM Grand this trip. Their customer service is far superior to Ceasars Palace or their other properties we visited this trip. I will take my money to MGM properties from now on."
50,Caesars Palace is beautiful and the STAFF is super friendly! Sofia P checked us in and she was super helpful and sweet. When we went to TOTAL REWARD Ana Gonzales truly stared our trip off with positive energy. It's nice to go on vacation and be surrounded by kind people.
20,This is the worst hotel for internet speed. I am trying to get some work done before I go down for dinner and have been trying to connect for 7 mins and counting. I went to the diamond desk to ask what could be done and was told to put a review on TripAdvisor. And the reservation agent knew it was bad. I am not sure if this is a four or five star but I have better connection in the middle of nowhere in Idaho and I use Hughesnet!  This will be the last time I stay here.
40,This is a busy hotel ..although check in was done online the automated machines had me going back to the assistant for help 3 times before it would accept my booking. Getting the room key for parking was a bit tricky‚Ä¶one of us had to wait in the car while the other sorts out getting checked in for a room key to enter the parking.. all a bit of a runaround and very time consuming. Our room in the Augustus tower had the most fantastic view over the fountain. Amenities such as dressing gowns slippers etc seem to have been done away with with covid. There is a coffee machine in the room but the pods (in sets of 4) need to be purchased in order to use it. Bed was very comfortable. Jacuzzi bath was lovely. Highly recommended but be prepared for a chaotic and very impersonal check in
40,We stayed here 5 nights in December. The hotel and casinos were excellent and packed. Disappointed the pool area was closed - the daily resort fee wasn‚Äôt discounted though.  Check-in was quick enough although the receptionist never looked up from her keyboard to speak to us. We went to celebrate our sons 21st birthday and it was on the booking but she never even said ‚ÄòHello‚Äô never mind ‚ÄòHappy Birthday‚Äô or ‚ÄòEnjoy your stay with us‚Äô.  We just got handed a key card with ‚ÄòAugustus Tower‚Äô on it and the room number with a wave of her hand round to the lift. It felt very impersonal after a long journey from the UK. (19 hours from door to hotel!)  The rooms were very clean and cleaned every day. Cannot fault the excellent service from the housekeepers in Augustus Tower.  I would definitely stay there again. We thoroughly enjoyed the whole of our holiday there.
10,The worst service and hotel I have been to in any other hotel specific in Las vegas.  Do not come to this hotel in Las Vegas and why:  1. There is no room service I empty bins by myself changed towels and sheets ask for shampoo and etc..  2. No solution to problems - u call the guest services they put a request - but no one came.  3. The rooms are dirty (basic cleaning before you come).  4. The receptionists are not pleasant. very bad costumer service.  5. Full of noise between the rooms.  6. no complimentary early check in! and we came like 2 hours before..  7. right now the hotel is under reconstruction so you have to walk long for uber and the main entrance is close.    In conclusion the Caesars Palace in Las Vegas wont worth you money - definitely stay in other hotel.
50,Caesars Palace was great to work with as our flight was canceled last minute. They worked well with us on the changes. We stayed in a Palace premium room the bathroom and beds were excellent. We did not mind the location of this space.
20,They charge you with using things in the room that you didn't use. My example the Bar in the room. They charge you weeks after the charge. I did not like it because I went to checkout to have the charge eliminated and they removed it at the moment but a week later they charge you.
10,Would never stay here again. Deceptive parking policy. Sign states complimentary parting if you are ceasars credit card holder. Then they change it to platinum or Diamond status. Requested house keeping services. Never got a fresh towel. Had to wait 90 minutes for bell hip to bring up bags. Hotel will charge $75 to use refrigerator for your personal use. Coffee machine no coffee. Resort fee says internet but will only allow 2 devices then will charge $15 a day. Staff argued that resort fee didn‚Äôt include internet when it‚Äôs stated on the website. Staff argued that everyone pays for parking. The sign says complimentary if you are Diamond or platinum so that means everyone doesn‚Äôt pay for parking. Nice size rooms. Homestead steakhouse was over priced and food was awful. One elevator sounded like something at an amusement park rigged and loud. How do you mess up a salad? Won‚Äôt stay here unless it‚Äôs free as someone‚Äôs guest. Would give it -1 stars if I could.
50,We upgraded to a fantastic suite with in-room jacuzzi two separate bathrooms and even a sitting room. Caesar‚Äôs offered us a special promotion for this. The hotel casino itself has wonderful restaurants. We enjoyed 3 of them - Nobu Mr Chow‚Äôs Hell‚Äôs Kitchen. All were fantastic. Great place to stay and with an excellent location walkable to other nearby resorts like Bellagio and Venetian.
30,Caesar‚Äôs used to be a 5 star stay but my recent trip had expectations that set me up for disappointment. The check in process will always be a hassle but now they have taken out the self check in kiosks and have fewer people working the check in desks. Once in your room don‚Äôt expect room service unless you specifically ask and even then you may be told it‚Äôs unavailable. The rooms are still very nice no complaints and in fact are very comfortable.  The casino seems to currently be undergoing construction so much of the slots are either curtained off or just turned off. The service at the bars where one can sit and play video poker is short staffed and also lacks proper stocking of common ingredients for cocktails.  Upon checkout the TV in your room is usually a great option. But no. Apparently they have turned off that option. Even the kiosks for an easy checkout are not accepting your checkout.  Don‚Äôt blame Covid for these shortcomings the property booked the amount of guests/rooms and should be able to provide service for the product sold.
40,Stayed at Caesar's for a family wedding - this was our first time visiting. Overall a positive experience. All staff that we interacted with were very friendly & professional (Front Desk Housekeeping Cashier etc). Augustus Tower room (which we were upgraded to at no charge) was very nice and spacious. Only issues we had with our stay was that the we had to pay a daily rate for Self-Parking and when we originally booked in Nov 2021 the parking was free at that time. Manager was polite but would not budge on waiving.
20,"my sisters and I decided to have a special time together as we all live so far from each other. We were planning on being a little extravagant. One of my sisters had stayed at Ceasars a few times and was happy with it plus it was close to a show (""O"") we were seeing. It started at the parking garage. Long wait to get an attendant understaffed...actually the entire place seems woefully understaffed. Do not expect help with your luggage for your mile-long walk or be prepared to have someone wait at the garage with your luggage until they track down someone (pray you do not need a restroom as this takes some time). Long lines checking in of course. The front desk people have no time for you so keep moving. We paid extra for a room upgrade with a view. The room was fine. It was very clean. Not much of a view. Thank god for a worker at the hotel that explained the minibar/coffee/snacks etc. They charge$5. per coffee pod. If you pick something off the tray and don't put it back within a few minutes you will be charged (so don't think you can eat it now and replace it) He told us to walk over to CVS and buy water coffee pods etc. A bottle of water is $6. same as the food court. I have never stayed at a hotel that did not give you complimentary coffee. Most of the staff looks like they don't want to be there and don't want you there either. It just seems sad."
20,This trip was planned in June for Year Eve‚Äôs celebration . Check in went smoothly. After an exhausting flight we just wanted to relax. Everything about our experience with Caesars Palace Las Vegas was HORRIBLE!! I don‚Äôt know if the New Year‚Äôs Eve weekend was too overwhelming for the staff or they are just lazy. No going the extra mile with this team. They need to take some classes from Gaylord Entertainment to know that the statement ‚ÄúI DON‚ÄôT KNOW‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt ever be used in the conversation from an associate to a guest. Everyone seem to foster attitudes as well. Thus we just decided to discover the land on our own.    Back to the room ‚Ä¶. I visited the front desk the next day after checking in because of fatigue after our flights. The refrigerator could not be used to put anything in it without a charge. NEVER HAVE I EXPERIENCED THIS! I called immediately to complain about the refrigerator use pay request of $75. Just couldn‚Äôt believe what I read and wanted it clarified    I further informed management of countless displeasures: broken or beat down furniture headboards pealing broken trading lamp trash left in the under counter vanity of the bathroom from previous residents squeaky beds and spotted stained window curtains. After waking the first morning we couldn‚Äôt believe the conditions of the curtain‚Äôs /drape‚Äôs Yulk! Don‚Äôt expect to see room service before 9 pm. One night we called for an extra blanket and since it was now 10 pm we gathered the trash and left it outside the door. Yes the person that delivered the blanket took our trash. Calls for room cleaning went unanswered.    We selected this hotel to allow us to go right to the concert that we arrived to see as this location is inside of the facility without leaving the building - the Colosseum. The hotel offered to attempt to make it right by offering a measly $30. You can bet the $30 wasn‚Äôt credited to my final statement. No one in their right mind haggles over $30 when you just want to be accommodated with a first class vacation experience.    Herewith are room pictures supporting my review. DO NOT STAY AT Caesars Palace!!    You spend time and much money to pay for a vacation and you expect to at least receive decent accommodations. Shame on Caesar‚Äôs Palace Las Vegas for allowing such a room to be presented to anyone.
10,"- Paid more to upgrade to Julius suite but room didn't match description view was buildings and rooftop.. fridge provided was completely filled with 'Wet Bar' items and virtually useless for guests. Very dissapointing for the costs..  - Cost for Early Check-in was selected but waited 3 hours for normal check-in at 4pm was finally referred to Express Check-in desk and was assigned a very poor room/suite (499) firt check-in guy was unfriendly and unhelpful and difficult to understand his ""english'.  - Clearly not enough staff to support the number of guests being 'hosted'.  - Very Poor navigation signage on floor to help guests navigate around large facility.  - Poor 'mapping' tool in the Caesar's App pretty much useless.  - Zero guest assistance with different gaming rules restrictions and requirements.  - Overwhelming cigarette smoke in many places on the floor.  - Virtually no restaurants open before 10-11AM  - Completely over priced for aging and out of date facility."
20,I am a handicapped senior citizen. We drove from Salt Lake City to this hotel and I reserved a handicapped room. I recently had my 5th hip surgery. I was looking forward to a walk in shower. It was nice. But as soon as I stepped off the bath mat I slipped on the shinny marble floors and fell right on my new hip. My husband had to rent a wheelchair from Caesars for the rest of the trip. I was not in a wheelchair before we went and only used a cane. Now I need to buy one based on my fall.
50,My stay started out with a wonderful check-in clerk by the name of Zandra. Pleasant as the day is long she did talk me into a nicer room in the Augustus tower and boy was the view worth it! Never have to leave this property everything you need right here. Even with a bit of construction going on it's still a nice stay.
50,This time to Vegas we chose Ceasers and weren‚Äôt disappointed. The staff was super nice the room and view were amazing. The bed was comfy the room was exquisite. We really enjoyed all the places to eat and the shopping.
20,"Dragged my wife with me to Vegas for a business trip in the middle of December leaving our children behind. We were hoping for a bit of a break from all this covid stuff. We arrived on a Sunday afternoon and checked in. Our room was ""ready"" so we went up to check it out. We didn't have much of a choice when it came to what type of room we got because we were there for a convention. The convention organizers had booked a block of rooms for the attendees. When we entered our first room(yes our first room) it was horrid!! First thing I did when I entered was damn near do a face plant due to the huge hump in the floor from the saggy carpet. once I recovered from that my wife starts pointing out all the stains in the carpet and walls. I looked as if someone threw a bottle of red wine on the floor and it exploded all over everything. now moving on to the bathroom.... First thing we notice is one of the vanity mirror lights were strobing and there was nothing we could do to stop it. This was almost distracting enough for me not to notice all the toothpaste splatter and what looked like blood all over the walls around the mirror but my wife sure noticed.  I called down to the front desk to ask for another room and I was met with the old ""sorry there is nothing we can offer in that price range.... Are you Serious?? Finally after some arguing and my wife now in tears because she really didn't want to come in the first place they found a room on another floor that we could move to. An Accessible room. I asked If I could have a look at it before moving all our stuff and was met with a swift ""No! we cant allow that."" so I agree to the new room because I figured it cant be any worse than this one Right?  Well... Up we go to the new room. We enter and things look OK. The carpet was still saggy and needed replacing but no stains that I could see at first glance. I open the curtains to see a bloody construction site. Oh! I can hear this bloody construction site too. We go to check out the bathroom. I mentioned earlier that it was a accessible room. this sink mirrors toilet are all very low to accommodate a person in a wheelchair.... Awesome!! More tears from the wife... only 4 more days to go.  Now for the positive stuff. As always the bell hops and the fellas outside assisting with cabs and information were phenomenal! Also the maid staff were very accommodating and friendly.  Julius tower might as well be a motel 6."
30,Very short staffed. Waited for an hour for our luggage at 1am....Other than that it is a nice hotel to stay and lots to do. Even thought it was holiday time I didnt agree with upping their prices on everything by double.
50,Great experience! Staff was great rooms were clean and the bath tub was amazing. Only concern is why Security deposit not returned on credit card as I was told by the associate who checked us in. I am awaiting for a response via email.
20,Stayed for one week. Nice room with a pool view in octavius tower. Now for the bad news. Check -out was a nightmare. No one at desk and the check in/out kiosks were shut off. The pool was closed. Good luck finding a reasonably priced restaurant. Pronto by Giada is terrible. Drinks are $15 to $19 at every bar. And it is very crowded during evening hours although I don‚Äôt know why. I will stay at an mgm property next time.
30,Very disappointed. Hotel is older and parts are run down. Carpet in room worn and torn Housekeeping is nonexistent Over priced. Wi-Fi is very poor throughout the hotel Check In process was extremely long and room not available until way after check in time
10,Booked the hotel couple month in advance upon checking in and going up to the room I was giving the wrong room. couldn't get anyone to answer the phone tried IVY supposedly personnel assistant through text messaging didn't work. Had to go back down to the receptionist with 4 kids and luggage was not convenient at all. I was told parking for guest was free I was charged $18.00 a day. Also they decided to change that the day I arrived. very poor service from customer service to the hotel etc...
10,Horrible experience.  because of the holiday season The Palace decided to tack on a $18 per day parking charge. I booked for four days about 4 months previously with no mention of this charge.  no problem with the resort fee of $45 per night plus 13.5% tax.  the hotel was unbelievably overcrowded with lots of people not wearing mask.  people tried to jam in elevators to the max.  we waited for an emptyelevator.  no enforcement of covd rules or mask mandates in Nevada.  I had the concierge take off the rip off parking fees.  When we visited Planet Hollywood for breakfastwe were charged $12 for 2 hours of parking. Also my thermostat in the room was broken for 2 days  We are done now with any hotels that are owned by CAESERS RESORTS.  NEVEREVER AGAIN!!!
20,The bathroom is dirty the room was dirty the couch has white stains on it when I asked the front desk about it they told me I had to wait till the next day for them to send someone to clean it and they never did
30,The bathroom was disgusting COVID-19 protocol was not done to this room. Upon my arrival the tub was black wash cloth was used and hung the bed sheet was ripped toilet had stains around it shower wall had dried nasal mucus from last guest. Disgusting! I called twice to the front desk first to change my room. They couldn‚Äôt because they were completely booked then to send the manager and housekeeping manager to view the room. They only sent the house keeper.
40,Check in was smooth. We decided to pay for early check in which was fine but did find rubbish in our bathroom bin? On the subject of housekeeping in a five night stay our room was cleaned once! Yes we would leave our room 11 ish most days and was surprised the room was not cleaned on our return???on one occasion we had to ring for clean towels? Not what you expect from a hotel of this standing.  However The room was nice and having the view of the ballagio fountains was amazing. The windows to the room are not v soundproofed so we did suffer from exceptional noise .. however putting this to one side the hotel itself is nice and has loads of shops and places to  eat. I think you have to stay at Caesar‚Äôs for the nostalgia but unfortunately I think hotels around it are of a better standard.
40,Really appreciated Julie taking the time to explain the hotel and varying things to do in Vegas. I asked a TON of questions and she answered every single one of them. I appreciated her energy and patience.
20,Beautiful hotel clean rooms great location however amenities are being cut and charges are rising at an alarming rate. Can absolutely find better value elsewhere.    Significant amount of gym equipment damaged and removed/not fixed or replaced.    Qua spa amenity day pass increased from $25 to $100 and 3 hour time limit now enforced.    No more show tickets for Diamond and above members.      Laurel Lounge closed and no replacement option for Diamond members.    Front desk/text service (even for premium members) is downright unacceptable; guaranteed reservation rooms not available incorrect billing multiple attempts in long lines needed to resolve problems.    Daily housekeeping no longer offered.    My advice consider other options and avoid disappointment.
30,I booked through Caesar place website which ‚Äú wasn‚Äôt a bad‚Äù deal. I ended up being charge a extra 200 dollars and no I did not get anything from the mini bar. That being said the location and amenities are nice.
10,"I will never stay at Caesars Palace again. Besides what Booking.com charged they charged us $51.00 each night for a resort fee taxes and a deposit of $500.00. Now that I could handle. However my room did not get cleaned 3 out of the 5 days we spent the night. I had to call for clean towels and that took them over an hour to get. My key did not work for the room 3 different times. Had to go down to the front desk to get it reset or get new keys (and it was far from our tower). At the front desk ""REYNA"" was very rude to me and my husband. To reset my key card for the room she wanted me to stand in the long line of guests checking into the hotel. It was late I was ALREADY a GUEST the people in the line were not but she wanted me to wait telling me it was ""protocol"". All I wanted was for my keys to work and for her to give me a key to get into my room. The hotel is beautiful; the spa experience was wonderful; the rooms were normal nothing special; HOWEVER the service from the front desk and housekeeping was TERRIBLE. I will NEVER stay her again!"
30,On my morning of arrival I received a message that my room was ready so I checked in at noon. When I checked out I had an $85 early check in fee added to the bill with no heads up that it was coming. I would‚Äôve just stowed luggage had I been advised that checking in early was an additional fee.
30,We decided to choose a five star hotel in order to be safer from COVID. The hotel advertised his cleaning measures and all that. One day someone from the staff forgot to lock the door of our Aircondition open in our room. What we saw was at least unhealthy!!!! I can‚Äôt believe that this is the image of a five star hotel. Definitely no one had cleaned the filters for years!!!
10,Hard water abrasive toilet paper sticky phones dirty lamps non working outlets on lamps extremely worn furniture and carpet. Worst yet is the Rewards program! If you have two last names the rewards program combines them this causes your name not to match your ID so you cannot use any Kiosks and the self checkin feature this causes you to wait in EXTREMELY long lines. No pens or paper. Front desk sends you to a CALL CENTER.
30,The hotel it self is amazing everything about it is so grand and I am glad we chose to stay there. Staff at the reception desk were helpful and friendly. We had 2 rooms in the julius tower the room was nice bed was very comfy and it served its purpose .  However housekeeping let the hotel down and left a sour taste to our holiday. We had money taken from top of the cabinet and out of 8 nights. the room was only made up 5 days but it was on random days so there was no way of knowing if the room would be made up or not that day or if we are going to get fresh towels etc.  It‚Äôs a shame as otherwise it‚Äôs been an amazing stay.
20,"We stayed here for two nights in December 2021. Firstly the good: the room in the Augustus Tower was beautiful. The positives end there.    Now for the negative:    Firstly Caesars clearly does not care about COVID. We wanted to go to the casino but we were quickly shocked by the amount of people without wearing masks in direct contravention of Nevada's mask mandate law. And worse no one was doing anything to rectify the issue. It was a shame because we really wanted to have fun at the casino.    Secondly we checked in at around 2 PM - which meant that we were subject to the ""early check in fee"" which we were told was $60. The gentleman who checked us in told us that he would waive this fee if we upgraded our room also for $60. Therefore we thought why wouldn't we upgrade. However when we checked out I saw after reviewing the final bill that the upgrade was actually $100 per night! This was never made known to us.    Upon check out I spoke to the manager about these two issues. To say she didn't care was an understatement. No apology. No explanation. She didn't care about my very reasonable and measured concern about COVID and she printed off an incredibly convoluted document that we signed which in my opinion could be easily interpreted to state that we agreed to upgrade for $60 per night. In her opinion it meant we agreed to pay $100 per night. I have never been treated so poorly by staff at a hotel particularly by a manager.    And to not even care about a global pandemic when thousands of people are passing through your door every day it's deplorable. Caesars has lost my business."
20,The hotel quality has diminished severely. The hotel was not clean and shows signs of age. I asked for a deep clean of my room but did not receive it. I will not stay at this hotel again; the service was disappointing.
40,Overall everything was great. The room was really nice with a great view. One thing I would recommend is that guests receive their Caesars Reward card at check in. Most likely everyone will want one. It was really awful spending an hour in line at the Caesars Reward desk that is open 10 to 10. The card machine had eaten someone's ID. It really takes the fun out of wanting to gamble when you have to stand in that awful line and from what I saw this is the normal thing every day. Also there should be a way to see how much money you have to spend at the gift shop or to buy a muffin. Lastly it is very unfortunate that your concierge person left during COVID and never returned. I really enjoy having a concierge person to help with suggestions and guidance on things to do and help answer questions.
10,I've pretty much stayed at every other strip property except for Caesars so I was excited to try it out for the first time this past trip. We booked an Octavius tower room almost a year ago and received a waived resort fee and free parking with Caesars Diamond status. Diamond status is definitely a great perk to have bc the resort fee is an ungodly $50 per night and it only gets you WiFi for two devices (+$15 for each device after that). In this day and age how this hotel can't just include WiFi is beyond me.    Caesars was very busy over this past Christmas holiday. With that being said staying during a busy time is not great at this hotel. The self parking structure is old and disjointed - if you park above the 4th floor you're going to need to ride two separate elevators located at opposite ends of the structure to get to the casino level. We had a larger group and had to wait a solid 20 min before we could fit into an elevator (never mind Covid protocols). If we didn't have luggage and a baby in a stroller I'd definitely recommend just taking the stairs to get to Level 1 for the Casino. Leaving the garage is also another situation - it seems that most people don't prepay their parking so the line to leave the garage can stretch all the way to the 4th level.    I would say that small details add up to make a hotel experience. The details added up to an awful experience at Caesars. First off The Octavius elevators had this unflattering white lighting that made it look like we were stepping into a dungeon. The screen in the elevator displayed a Windows error message and there was no mood music or anything to keep you entertained. Usually Vegas hotels pump in some mood music and the elevator screens display some hotel information or random stuff to hype up your stay. This was the case for every elevator in this tower and it was never corrected during the 3 nights/4 days we stayed here. Keep in mind that this is suppose to be Caesars Entertainment's flagship property in Las Vegas...    Next up our room in the Octavius tower was very worn down. Furniture paint was chipped the headboard to our bed was peeling off the bathroom fixtures were falling apart stains were on the furniture. There were suspicious stains in the bathroom that we had to clean ourselves bc we didn't want our 1 year old to touch it. Overall the room was in terrible shape and cleaning was suspect. Whenever we showered water would leak from the shower into the toilet room and flood half the bathroom. We requested that someone come to fix the issue but it was not addressed during our stay. We ended up shoving some towels around the leak to contain the water. They were also super stingy with the toiletries and for a hotel that includes a soaking tub I was surprised they did not include any liquid body wash/salts for said tub. Again this is suppose to be their flagship property...    After staying at Resorts World prior Caesars really is showing its age. The in-room tech was lacking (no option to cast content from your phone to the TV) no mini-fridge to help store items no automated sheers etc. This is ridiculous considering this property regularly charges the same if not more than the other premium resorts in town like Wynn Encore Bellagio Venetian Palazzo Cosmo etc. For the money you are much better off staying at those other properties.
40,A concierge and luggage storage in the ACTUAL hotel would solidify Caesar‚Äôs as a top contender. The room was neat but lacked a thorough cleaning. The rooms could also use a microwave. Very convenient and enjoyed the Forum and tons of eating options. The Colosseum was GREAT!
50,Everyone was pleasant and friendly. The hotel was clean. The hotel has so many amenities you don't have to leave if you dont want to. I would just advise you be prepared to walk a lot because a lot of the rooms are on the opposite end of the entrance
50,I am a 7Stars member and Eric has helped me a few times at the VIP check-in. He has always been very professional efficient and helpful in accommodating my room preferences & providing information on my booked offer. This makes it always a pleasure to start my stay at Caesars!
40,Our recent stay at Caesars was a great one. The hotel staff was extremely accommodating and friendly (thank for the free room upgrade Caesars staff!) and the place was immaculate. Our only gripe was the vinyl on bed's headboard was peeling and cracking and there was a small tear in our sheets. Nothing too bad but it was noticeable.    While we loved our room we weren't too thrilled with the gaming floor. The casino floor plan is extremely disjointed and despite the size of the place the slot area(s) was relatively small especially compared to some of its nearby competition. Also there was a lack of variety in the slot machines and some of the most popular ones aren't at Caesars; we ended up going to Bellagio to play. All in all if you're looking for a good place to stay on the strip Caesars is a great option. If you're looking for the best place to place to play you might be better off going to Bellagio Venetian or Cosmo.
40,It was not made clear during check out at the time of making my reservation or I completely overlooked the fact that veteran‚Äôs received a discount on their stay. The stay was great but I was deeply disappointed to learn during check in that veteran discounts could not be applied after the reservation was made. This should be changed and applied anytime prior to end of stay.
40,As a Diamond Status member of Caesars Rewards this ended up being a very nice stay. (Look into status matches from Hilton/Marriott to Wyndham to Caesar.) With Diamond you avoid the annoying and too expensive resort fees; you can get into separate lines/front of line for Rewards Desk buffet and other restaurants; and other attractive benefits. (There is also apparently a separate check in area for Diamond and above members but we didn't use it.)    But if we didn't have that status I'm not sure we would have enjoyed the hotel quite as much. Any kind of status does get you discounted room rates and it costs nothing to sign up so definitely do that.    We reserved a room in the Octavius Tower overlooking the pools. (see photo) The room did have a nice view of the pools but I would have to stay in other locations to assess whether it is worth it to pay a bit more for that view. I will say that the resort is quite large and that Octavius is a bit of a walk from the lobby and the Strip. I read other reviews complaining about the walk and thought they might be exaggerating. But even for a couple of nights the extra walk does start to wear on you--especially if you tend to get lost or wander which is easy to do in the casino area.    The room was a pretty good size and the furnishing were fine if not memorable. The bathroom was a decent size with dual sinks. But both the shower and one of the sinks drained very very slowly.    The location of the hotel in the center of the Strip was ideal for walkers. Tons of eating and shopping options. I appreciated that there was a food court-type location adjacent to the Caesars casino with a Halal Guys. Tasty and healthy food that doesn't cost and arm and a leg. We also enjoyed the buffet (see separate review).
20,I usually stay at Caesar's properties because I am a rewards club members. I usually stay at less nice hotels because they are generally more convenient and have cheaper gambling/better odds. I decided to go with Caesars Palace this time because I've always heard it was a great hotel. If it was it doesn't seem like it anymore.    If you take Uber you will be dropped off in the bowels of the hotel near service entrances. You may see an employee smoking or hauling trash. Not a peasant first impression. I guess that is to give a nod to the dying taxi industry who get to park in the front of the hotel. The walk from the Uber entrance to the front desk is LONG.... and oh so confusing with the terrible signage. And construction that has you going through narrow tunnels in places.    Finally made it too the room which was nice and big and an OK view. In the bathroom I found multiple pubic hairs on the floor which as you can imagine was disgusting. I was going to take a bath in the huge jetted tub until I realized the was hair in there.    Ah a keureg coffee maker. I will have a cup before I go down. I opened it up to an empty coffer pod still in it. (Did anyone clean?). No worries. I looked for a new one and saw it on the mini bar. $20. No thanks. So I ordered it from Giada downstairs via my phone for pick up ($1 extra). I get down there and it still takes 15 minutes to get my coffee in a mostly empty place. $11 total for a cup. Look I know they have to make money but this is idiocracy that makes airport and ballpark pricers blush.  Good day at gaming (at other hotels) and am back by midnight. I start looking for something to eat....nothing. It all closes down. A fast food cart could make a killing if it was legal. Had to go all the way to the Linq to get In and Out.    Overall I was not happy with the hotel the housekeeping the food choices pricing or anything. So disappointed because I wanted by first stay at Caesars to be story worthy. Well it is. Just not for the reasons I wanted.
10,Nothing about this hotel is first rate. The approximate 250 a night rate was far above what it was worth. No amenities no service no resort type service. A 45+ rate for resort fee was useless. No pool no hot tubs fitness room only open until 4pm.  They even tried to charge for parking at the end.  What is this with $50 min at Blackjack table.  Obviously not a people friendly hotel.
10,We were told we had more beds than we were given needed 2 queens received one. We called customer service and the lady Todd is this happens all the time and it's the third partys fault (booked through hotel. Com) the shower barely works. This place is a joke.
10,Where to start. The ride share pick up is a major hike. There is no place in the hotel to sit unless you are eating drinking or gambling. What kind of 5 star resort doesn't have a place to sit. People were sitting on the floor and stairs. Once checked in the room was not real clean and they never provided maid service though we requested. The bed and bed linens were not as nice or comfortable as I have had in Holiday Inns. Most our friends were at the Cosmopolitan. Night and day compared to the dump.
40,"This is just a quick review to inform people. My BF and I stayed here from Dec 16 to 19th. We did decide on an upgrade to the Augustus tower and our room was amazing clean and the lady who cleaned did a great job. As far as i could see the casino and the other areas were all clean and everyone we interacted with was great especially the lobby bar/restaurant people. Yes it is Vegas and everything is more expensive but we went in there knowing. I booked this month a while back so i got a really great price on our room. we also went to Ramsey's Tavern 2 nights it was so fabulous!!! again expensive but its Vegas and everything is. We did not touch our room ""bar"" so we didnt receive any additional charges."
20,We did not get a room in the tower booked. Waited in line 40 minutes to request room change told nothing can be done till next day. I would have to wait in line again this on top of the initial 30 minute wait at original check in! Eventually a room change was organized and it was in the same tower we were already staying. We opted out of changing. They still cut off our wifi thinking we had changed rooms and at midnight I waited on hold for tech support. When I finally got through I was told I would have to go wait in line at the front desk for help. Upon checkout I had a billing question where again was subjected to another wait‚Ä¶besides the incompetence at the front desk this property is starting to look very tired and in need of a facelift. The room we stayed in was no better than a common room at a ‚Äúmotel 6‚Äù. NOT at all the experience or quality we have enjoyed at Caesar‚Äôs in the past! Housekeeping did a good job!!!
20,We booked through expedia. while booking it clearly showed that the parking was included. On the day of checkout i was forced to pay for parking. The checkout counter told me that every hotel had started charging and hence caesar palace had decided to charge. I have never heard more lame excuse than this. This was a clear bait and switch.
30,We arrived Christmas Eve stood in Express Check In for 30-40 minutes. Walking to hotel room took a good 10 minutes. Waiting for food in the food hall was quick. Definitely recommend making reservations in their restaurants as they are long (1-2 hour) waits. Asked for extra towels via Room Service and that took 45 minutes. Even card tables to gamble you had to wait. Not their fault really‚Ä¶their hotel is humongous with insufficient staff so you had to wait for everything.
10,No self check in kiosk works. Waited 2 hours in line to grab keys. Did mobile check in but that means nothing. Self park is far for any members besides Diamond or seven stay members only. Not worth the way or $ to stay here. Trust me if you‚Äôre platinum member or below. Don‚Äôt stay
10,Try to make customers to pay more.  They offer room upgrade and other promotions to make customers accept it and sign the agreement paper.  I was surprised when I checked the receipt. I talked to a supervisor at the front desk and she told me she can't help me because I signed the paper shows pricesvery clearly.  When I check in the guy told me $25/ day but the paper says $75/ day. And one time fee of $156 but it says $186.  Watch out!
40,This hotel had. been. significantly updated since our last stay which is nice; however I sort of missed the old Caesars Palace even if it seemed to be in a time warp. The hotel is huge and has many amenities. Rooms are. nice.
30,I checked in today 22nd all the way from Sydney with my family for 3 nights and special anniversary. We have been looking forward to staying in Vegas and staying at Ceasars Palace. The room is great and checkin went well concierge were good. Unfortunately that was the good experience. Next the phone in the room does not work so I had to call from phone near lift to get bags sent to room. Phone will not be looked at till tomorrow so no fix. No big deal but at night I needed to make up my little girls baby bottle. I went to use the coffee machine was dirty with old coffee and grim came out when I tried to get hot water it was disgusting and dirty. I rang down from the phone near lift again at around 12.30am and spoke to someone named Joe. I asked if I could get a kettle to boil water in which he said no. He said use the coffee machine in room. When I explained what came out he just said sorry he cannot help. When I asked if I could get hot water from anywhere in hotel he just said no and had no solution for me no empathy at all and said there is nothing he can do. I'm sure if I was VIP or high roller I would have been treated differently but my first night here was not what I imagined for my anniversary with my wife and family. I would have thought Every guest should be treated with respect.
30,We arrived on a busy holiday weekend and yet the front desk was inadequately staffed. The check in line was slow and long. When I made my reservation months in advance they said I would get 2 adjacent rooms but when I got there they were trying to split our party up into two different floors. After a long wait they put us on opposite ends of the same floor. When we got into the room the mirrors were dirty!    Granted the bathroom was amazing. The pillows were incredibly unenjoyable.    Does not live up to their name or expectations. Will not go back again.
20,The resort fee was $52 and it literally covers nothing. Parking is additional $18 WiFi is limited to 2 devices and not good signals. The cell phone signal is very weak in the room I can barely make a phone call. The in-room phone does not work can't even call the front desk.    I asked not to have housekeeping service during check in and the housekeeper came and cleaned anyway which is fine but he/she threw away my unfinished bottle of water and my contact solutions so I have to purchase again. And also threw away the cups but did not supply new ones overall making more trouble for me (and since the in-room phone doesn't work I can't call to ask for more cups or anything).    Always wanted to stay Caesar's but not very impressed.
40,The hotel was super clean the staffing super friendly and professional. Caesars organization need to revisit their in room bar prices. A bottle of water $9 a coffee $5:50 that is unreal. The place looks amazing
10,My stay at the hotel (still in house as I type this) has shown how bad things have gotten in Vegas and how the standards of what was once a great property are non-existent.    First off kept getting messages about using mobile check in yet the system didnt work. Tried calling the hotel but when you call the main number instead of the hotel you get routed to a call center in the Philippines. Nice people but not at all equipped to help.    Get checked in and up to a suite that was large but clearly in need of a refresh and of questionable cleanliness. Tried calling for extra items including an extra blanket extra pillow and a refrigerator. It took 3 calls to only be told they were out. Finally the front desk was able to make it happen.    The next day trying to get housekeeping service proved almost impossible as well via both phone calls and text messaging. Catching a housekeeping supervisor in the hallway helped finally make this happen.    Security is a problem here as there is a distinct lack of it. Besides being begged for money in front of the hotel and at the Forum Shops there was a random homeless man in the hallway outside of my room. Definitely doesn‚Äôt help that the elevator key card readers are deactivated.    Attention to Covid precautions is another major issue as there was no visible cleaning or sanitization going on. Plus no enforcement of the mask requirements especially in places where it really counts like the gym.    The gym is another problem. Aside from the mask issues they dont have the staffing to keep it clean and maintained.    Tried communicating with management and thats near impossible as well. You can get supervisory level employees to talk to but actually empowered managers dont seem to be accessible to guests.    This stay truly has soured me on the Caesars group of casinos and Vegas as a whole.
30,This is my second time staying at Caesars and this time was not as great as the first time. I arrived and went to check in at the kiosk and kept getting a message my room was not ready when check in was at 4! I had to go wait in line to check in and by that time it was already almost 5. Get to my room and the bathroom cabinets had missing paint and the faucets were hard to turn on. There was damaged wood in the bathroom by the shower and the a/c really didn‚Äôt work! Hopefully the next stay my room will be ready and I won‚Äôt have to miss my dinner reservations due to not being able to check in and my room will be a little better!
10,If you take one thing away from this review go up the road to The Venetian if you want the Italian theme with superior quality cleanliness and value. The Forum Classic Suite is poorly maintained and should be avoided as should this well past its prime hotel due to the poor customer service that accompanied the room. The carpet was dirty the towels were dirty and/or stained the glassware was chipped the shower would not get warm and the entire room smelled like about 20 years of smoking had soaked into everything around you.    The Caesar's Palace used to stand for luxury and quality but those days are apparently gone. Do yourself a favor choose another spot for your vacation because if anything goes wrong even if it's the wrongdoing of the hotel you will be wasting time on your trip fixing it for yourself and paying for the opportunity.
20,Went to Amalfi‚Äôs for dinner. We drove and used Ceasers self parking. $30.00 flat rate no matter how long you were there. Staying at the MGM it‚Äôs 26.00 a day and had a show at Planet Hollywood they were 12.00 for 4 Hrs.    Now that they‚Äôre greedy is one thing. But that greediness turns into a nightmare when you‚Äôre trying to leave. We spent 40 minutes in lines trying to get to the gate to insert our ticket. Shame on you Ceasers shame on you. If you want the money you should have designed the system to work.    If you‚Äôre driving don‚Äôt go near Ceasers. Shoulda used valet but I‚Äôm betting that would have been double.
40,"Well get your walkin shoes on can't do roller skates but this place is huuuuge. We were dropped off at the Uber & bus stop long walk to ck in longer walk to our Palace Tower. The great guy at front desk got us a room w/city view close to elevator. Thank God for that cuz those halls are looong. Our room looked at Mirage where Beatles Love plays & the Fab 4 were painted SO realistically on the wall. LOVEd seeing them missed John & George.  The food there is really high even fast food like $6 bagel $7 OJ $8 oatmeal at Pronto. So skipped the $55 breakfast/$75 dinner buffet lol. Ate often at Pronto cuz close to our tower & saw long lines at buffet all the time. Walked farther to Food Court had pizza burgers tacos always lines. Can't even see Starbucks lines so long. One great table service was Trevi by Forum Shops Phil & Saul really hoppin. A+ for the food tho I've never had a $11 tomato soup before lol.    We flew there from FL for the Journey concert fab as always Arnel jumpin all over as always. BTW hubby has ""Wheel In the Sky"" on the tv right now! Held in Colosseum huge venue great screens sold out.  Room was fine NO free coffee or H2O no frig just mini bar. THAT'S a first."
40,this is my third time vegas first time caesars on checkin in at 10pm night the receptionist advised us that all was paid inc resort fees he even gave us a free upgrade .i had medication with me that needed to be kept in fridge so i removed some tins of small soda and placed on top of fridge.(did not consume) on checking the room we found the bottom section of bed was not cleaned (looking for my shoes next day) we were in room3792 also one day on our return we found our front door on latch maid forgot to lock also while cleaning she /he broke a set of headphones on checking out we were running late for flight we were then charged resort fees and $75 (MOVED ITEMS) for the movement of unconsumed items the desk manager was called delano he was a very arrogant condescending person we had no choice but to pay resort fees for a pool that was also closed also on thinking all the items /snacks where not ic cov19 sealed bags also items in fridge no prevention of cov19 spread also house keeping did not wear masks or gloves caesars palace in general is a amazing hotel amount one of the top three i have stayed in so people remember these golden rules vegas is designed to suck you dry of your hard earned money your just a tourist mark when driving there is no sort of things like cortese indicators mean accelerate so you have no room for minovery also there hands are stuck on their horns (GASAIRINSTALL@GMAIL.COM)
40,Everything was fine. Clean room nice bathroom. But noticeably thin walls. Kinda put a damper on our late night ‚Äúactivities‚Äù. Then checked out and were charged for a candy from the mini bar for no reason. We‚Äôre not going to call and complain we‚Äôre just not going to book again.
40,We checked in at Diamond check in and everyone was lovely. We got our favorite room in Augustus Tower over looking the strip and fountains. Everyone at check in could not have been more accommodating.  Yes there is construction. It was a bit of a longer walk to the casino but I am sure it will be lovely when finished.  I have to do a shout out to our host Jeff Glantz. He always makes us feel special . He is one of the main reasons we keep returning.  This time we had dinner at The Water Grill in the Forum Shops. It is not connected to the hotel so no discounts etc. But I highly recommend it. Lovely dinner.  Thank you Jeff and thank you Caesars for always taking care of us.  See you soon.
50,But the swimming pool was closed! And resort fee tax 51$ daily exorbitant!!!!!! I wanted to stay longer but couldn‚Äôt afford it. Also 89$ for breakfast buffet!!!! Too much for my budget. The show at cirque du soleil was beautiful.
20,Was horrified at the condition of our room and it ruined our entire trip. Room 1578 looked like something you'd see at a 1-star roadside inn. It appears they're cutting corners to recoup money lost during pandemic. So sad!
20,I‚Äôll get straight to the point(s)‚Ä¶  Caesar‚Äôs does not inform you they are under major construction!  Upon arriving at the hotel the eye sore of cranes metal barriers boarded and forever walkways. Inside more chaos with closed areas causing pedestrian traffic and the smell of cigarettes that engulfs you. The taxi stand is not in front of the hotel they have designated it about 50 yards away. Good luck to those that have a difficult time walking me included.  Monday morning at about 6:30am we were awoken by drilling and banging! The floor above ours was being worked on‚Ä¶this early in the freakin morning?! That afternoon after returning from lunch we were met by a housekeeper who had entered our room where we had displayed the ‚Äúroom was occupied‚Äù sign. She requested a supervisor who arrived and apologized for the mishap. We were both upset but glad we arrived when we did. Guests and workers are required to wear face masks in all the hotels neither of the 3 workers present were wearing them?!  We all stayed in the Palace Tower where the rooms could use some updating and air sanitizing. The curtains in our non-smoking room were not pleasant.  We planned this trip with another couple to celebrate our anniversary and my husbands birthday and while we had a good time we wont be staying at Caesars again.
50,Eric is amazing. He made us feel so welcomed when we first checked in. All of our requests were met. So friendly and his service is impeccable. From the time we checked in to the time we got our room he have us 5 star treatment.
30,The hotel location is awesome it‚Äôs right in the middle of the main strip. The rooms are huge and the beds are comfortable. Room service is ok but could be better considering the price you pay for a night. The water for the shower and sink could be better took a long time for the hot water to kick in. Asking room service for replacement sheets and covers could have been a lot better if taken the time to listen to concerns. I got put next to a service room for employees so it got pretty loud at some points of the day when employees were going in and out of the service room slamming their doors. I‚Äôm not one to complain too much considering it was just me staying there but things could have been better! Over all the stay wasn‚Äôt bad.
40,Great room for the price! A lot of amenities and a great view lots of options for the mini bar and was nice to have a jacuzzi tub in the room made the trip very worth it too a little hard to get around but all in all good stay.
30,This hotel doesn't allow the average hard working person that buys liquor and food outside the hotel to keep in mini fridge. They bombard you with their over priced watersnacks and liquor then charge you a ridiculous fee if you touch or move anything. Over-rated! The only way to describe this hotel.
30,Checked in Julius tower that I booked is not available. I am a Diamond+ guest. I no longer have a host was never informed. So I did not get a call the day before my arrival to verify my room choice and to have it pre-assigned. This was booked for my son‚Äôs birthday. 5 nights. Given the Octavius tower it‚Äôs nice but the headboard is damaged light bulb out and major knicks in the baseboards. I took pictures and wanted it noted. Was sternly told no room changes. I didn‚Äôt ask but ok. Service has slipped and I am hoping it‚Äôll soon be back. I love this place!
20,What I like about this hotel is that it is right in the middle of the Strip. Great location! And have you seen the hotel from the outside? Jaw dropping!    I also like that there are so many shops and restaurants inside. The person at the front desk that helped us check-in was very nice and efficient. I heard their Buffet is to die for. We will find out tomorrow. üòä    I also liked the size of our room. It's big and comfortable like the rooms at the Venetian. I think it's much bigger than the rooms at Mandalay Bay and the M Resort.    Since it is such a big hotel I wouldn't suggest staying here if you are not able to tolerate the long walk from the self parking lot to the front lobby and the looong walk from the lobby to Octavius Tower. But there's always valet parking if you don't mind paying extra for the convenience.    Based on our stay here tonight I wouldn't recommend this hotel. The deal breaker for me is the room we're in tonight. The curtains are covered with dust and the headboards are old and delapidated. It looked like chickens scratched the leather off of it. Because of this the headboards looked dirty and gross.    I hope the Management of this hotel would check all their rooms and replace the headboards and clean the curtains if they care about the health of their guests.    I'm assuming that with the amount of dust on the curtains it hasn't been cleaned for many months.    I'm sure not all rooms are as dirty as what we got so you could gamble and stay here or I suggest you stay at the Venetian instead. üòä
10,We arrived at close to midnight but the line at check in was so long it took us over an hour to register. Only about half the windows were open. How can you claim as a hotel to care about service and hospitality when you treat your guests like this? What kind of host makes you wait at 12 midnight for over an hour to get to your bed. What a loud clear announcement that Cesar's Palace does not care about you your time your comfort your enjoyment and your convenience. Do not give them your business.    Also they got the reservation wrong and had the overwhelming nerve to blame their error on Priceline. Well I called Priceline and they did not like being blamed for the incompetence of Cesar's Palace. The good and responsible people at Priceline took care of everything for me. Skip this selfish unfriendly pass the buck hotel and go somewhere that cares about getting things right
20,"All Caesars Palace is interested in is digging into your pocket and that is before you enter the casino. We arrived mid-morning and did not expect a room to be ready but went to the front desk to check. We were told we could check in early for a $68 fee or if we wanted to upgrade our room for $50 per night (4 nights) they would waive the early check-in fee and let us check-in immediately. We declined and they said check back after 2pm (official check-in is 4pm). We checked our luggage and had lunch played some (at Caesars and other casinos) and checked back at 3pm. We were told we could then get a room immediately for a $50 fee. We declined. Miraculously at 4:10pm our room was now available.    Our room was in the Forum Tower and while clean the room was dated. The hallways and vending area were in dire need of paint. Also the resort fee of $50+ a day is to cover local phone calls (who uses a land line anymore???) the gym (that is only open from 6am to 4pm) and internet (that is crappy at best and if you connect more than 2 devices cost an additional $15 a day). In the room is a coffee maker but if you use the coffee in the minibar it is an additional $26!!! When staying at what is supposed to be a 4-star hotel with a hefty resort fee I would expect at least a free cup of coffee and reliable good internet service. Most of the employees we encountered on the hotel side were quite rude and did not seem to appreciate your being there.    We are not big gamblers but we also did not have a comped or discounted room. I don't expect to have my a__ kissed like a ""whale"" but at least treated like my business is appreciated and not have my pocket dug into constantly."
20,*****WARNING*****  The snacks and beverages in the room are NOT complimentary! At check-in this was NEVER mentioned nor was it posted in the room where these items are located.  I was billed $238.51 for a combination of 1 box of Skittles 2 bottles of Fiji water gourmet coffee kit Pringles 1 bottle of Cosmopolitan and several more treats. I booked a Premium Palace room for a 1 night stay that was nearly $400 so naturally I assumed the snacks were included. NEVER have I been charged for bottled waterteacoffee in any other hotels that I‚Äôve stayed at.  Tuh Good luck with speaking to anyone in the billing department! As I made numerous attempts to contact the billing department to discuss the fact that the $100 room deposit wasn‚Äôt refunded to my credit card after 10 business days. Of course the room was left in immaculate condition so where‚Äôs my deposit?  I filed a dispute with my financial institution and a provisional credit was issued for $187.56(the amount billed to my card). However after a 2 month investigation the credit was reversed. I call my cc company to find out the reason/s for the determination and they mailed me a copy of the receipt. Needless to say I was blown away and very pissed to discover being charged.  The room was picture perfect with a view of the various pools. No problem with the room at all.  NEVER AGAIN!!!! Had the front desk staff been forthcoming this could have been avoided. I could pursue it legally however legal fees would far exceed the amount that I was charged.  I‚Äôm only sharing this to save anyone who is considering a stay here unexpected charges and the headache of trying to get your money back.
50,Emma at the front desk showed us how the 5 stars hospitality should be.  Attentively responding to the guest questions.  Very professional.  Kudos to all the front desk staff especially Emma.  Check in 12/20/21 - 12/21/21  Rwds # 19606001306
20,This hotel was not at all what was advertised def was a first and last stay here. The rooms are small and wasn‚Äôt worth the money I could‚Äôve stayed at a regular hotel. Some of the staff in the casino was racist and very blunt and disrespectful. I definitely didn‚Äôt stay around to waste my money with these people. Outside of the forum shops there‚Äôs nothing exciting about Cesars Palace
10,In Las Vegas for a concert for one night. They shut the water off to the tower we stayed in and would not simply move us to anther room without an all out argument. We just wanted to shower and brush our teeth before getting on the plane. So many options in Las Vegas simply just stay somewhere else.
20,We came to Vegas to celebrate our 35 Anniversary(had to postpone it twice in the last 2 years). Wanted an upgraded room with a view of the fountains. Got an ugly view of something else but according toCaesars it was a view of the strip so it was an updated charge of $330+ on our bill The hotel is so confusing to get around in. Staff is unfriendly and casino is a nightmare Stayed at Cosmopolitan our last night. It was perfect. Bye bye Caesars
40,My friend and I traveled to Vegas just for one night - to see a concert at the Coliseum. We stayed at Caesar's since it's attached. IT was nice. The room wasn't ready when I checked in but then they switched it and gave us a ready room. The room was way larger than I thought it would be 2 full beds a full sitting room a great view of Vegas a huge bathroom with a shower and a huge tub (which I didn't even get to enjoy because I wasn't there long enough!). We had a small issue with our TV and the front desk sent up someone in tech to fix it while we were out. My only issue (and this may be at all resorts - I haven't been to Vegas in 10+ years) is that when we returned we wanted room service and all you can get now is delivery from the restaurants and it ended at 11. It's Vegas! There wasn't really anything available for room service 24 hours. That's really it.
50,Caesars palace never disappoints. We always get excellent service! Rooms are clean beds are super comfy and the central location is a must! Only complaint was it was under construction which is a bummer and loud in the mornings but I'm sure will be worth it when all done!
20,I stayed at Caesars for a work conference. My room had not been properly cleaned on the first night it wasn't gross but dusty and hair in the tub rings around sinks and tub. I found out later they were experiencing plumbing issues. Rings were due to slow draining. I contacted the maintenance dept. and housekeeping about a leak from sink. After 2 days and no response. I called for extra towels everyday to clean up water mess and took showers with about 2 inches of water at my feet. I stood in line at front desk to change my room after 20 minutes I got to the desk and the lady said her computer went down and I should try coordinating with maintenance and housekeeping because she couldn't help me. The hotel is under construction-pick up/drop off is a nightmare. Don't stay here until they get it together.
40,Rooms were fine. Reserved King room online 2 months before visit but was given queen beds. Was sold out of Kings. Could‚Äôve got a King when one became available but didn‚Äôt want to pack everything up again. The express check in wasn‚Äôt very smooth but after some help from the clerk it got taken care of.
10,I won't make this too long but the short version is I booked a great deal directly through Caesar's as a Diamond level Rewards member. When I checked in they offered some upgrade options and I agreed to an upgrade to a suite. Upon walking in the room smells heavily of smoke (thing the Riviera hotel in the 90's) there are crumbs on the carpet I go to take a shower and one of the towels is super dirty whatever it's been a long day and I just want to relax so I go to take a shower. The water will not warm up and the pipes sound like they're struggling. I give up a relaxing shower not an option and decide I'll pour myself a drink and just relax on the couch. I pick up the glass and luckily looked at it not trusting anything in this room now and see the rim is cracked and chipped.    That was the last straw. So at 11 pm at night I went to ask that they move me to another room. I would even accept a downgrade I just wanted a clean room to sleep in. I am told by Darian (sp?) a female at the front desk that after speaking with her manager she was told no room changes would be allowed tonight. They would not even confirm that I could change my room the next day if I were willing to uncomfortably sleep in a dirty room they were charging me almost $400 a night for when the original room I had booked was only $114!    I am not one to complain in most situations and have stayed at Caesars many times but this was just a disgusting display of disregard for safety (cracked glass I could've cut myself drinking from who knows what was on that towel and if I would've gotten something by inadvertently cleaning my face with it) and comfort.
30,Took my wife to Vegas for our 35th Anniversary. Decided to travel first class and stay at what I thought was first class. Room was supposedly upgraded. I‚Äôd hate to see what we were supposed to get. Room was at very end of hall. Not good for wife as she has bad hips. Then when we get to the room there was a coffee maker but we had to pay $22 for 6 K-Cups because I removed them from the mini bar‚Ä¶ Was told that I could get coffee from Starbucks or any other place that sold coffee. Can‚Äôt believe that they don‚Äôt have free coffee. Hell as much as I paid for the room the coffee should have been complimentary.  As we were sleeping we were awoken by a very loud noise. Found out that they were pulling wires through the walls. Construction was happening around us but we were never told. I could have stayed at a Best Western saved a ton of money and got free coffee construction free.
10,Our stay at Caesars has been less than accommodating. It started out with when I called Bacchanal to ask if there was a separate line for Diamond status rewards members. The first attendant on the call had no idea what a Diamond status was. The second attendant I called through the Rewards Hotline said no there was just a general line. When I actually arrived at Bacchanal I saw there was a dedicated line for Diamond status. Our group had changed our plans to arrive early enough to mitigate a long wait thinking that there would only be one general line only to find that was unnecessary.    On our first night here one room was informed that the adjoining room‚Äôs front door had jammed and that maintenance would need to use our door to access the room. This process ended up taking a few hours and we had to change our plans while we had maintenance people come in and out of our room. There was no offer of assistance or accommodation when we said we had to leave soon so our only option was to change our entire schedule that night.    To top off this trip this morning (12/19/2021) we wake up and there is no running water to the shower sink or toilet. We had NO warning of this whatsoever. I was in the process of washing my face and had soap in my eyes when to my surprise I turned on the faucet and nothing came out. We called the front desk and was told there was nothing they could do. I had to go down to the Diamond to get any new accommodations (moved to another room with a slightly later checkout)    To top it all off there seemed to be bullet hole in the elevator. Through the fake plaster and through the metal of the elevator.    This has been the most unsatisfying trip to Vegas. Probably won‚Äôt be staying at Caesar‚Äôs for any future stays.
20,Their new strategy of only letting their premier customers be dropped off at hotel registration is really odd. Lyft/Uber drivers say that they keep moving things around and we were also given mixed messages from staff.    It's pretty crappy to make folks go through the Forum Shops and through the Casino just to check in after traveling to Vegas.    I realize that you want to reward folks who have lots of rewards with you but the ride share setup is really disorganized and I'm tempted to just go to other resorts next time.    Please find a better way to organize your ride share system.
20,My wife and I went to see a show at Ceasars Palace. The show was great. As far as the hotel was concerned we would not stay there again. When we checked in we were early due to the time our flight arrival time. We were told there would be a early check in fee. When checking out this fee was listed for each day. Other fees were also listed for each day. I have tried calling the hotel several times everyone I speak to tells me I need to speak to someone else. While at the hotel it was a challenge to get answers to questions about where things were. The facility is very large but there were no places to sit down.  I realize it's Vegas but food prices were extremely high.  I am done with contacting the hotel about my billing concerns. I'm disputing charges with credit card company. Let them sort it out.
50,The hotel and amenities are wonderful. We stayed in the Octavius Tower (when we got there on 12/9 they offered us an upgrade for free) next time I would want to stay in the Forum or the Palace tower-these rooms are located closer to the food courts and casino floor. Octavius is near the buffet and at the other end of all the action. This is my opinion. This hotel is so large you can walk yourself to death. There is lots to do without ever leaving the hotel. We did turn our light on to have our room cleaned one day and the room was not cleaned when we came back:(
30,"The morning of my arrival I received an email from Caesars offering that i could check in online to save the wait in line when I arrived. So I clicked on the link thinking this would such a great way to avoid a long line wait. Alas it turns out they charge you $50 to do this and call it ""early check-in"". But I did not get into my room until 4pm! I explained the situation to them at the front desk and they said that I agreed to the charge when I clicked on the link in the email. They would not reverse the charge and I was charged an additional $50 for a service I did not receive.    I was here for a conference but in the future I will not blindly book a room a the conference hotel."
40,When I called the desk to check I was told we has already been checked out. Housekeeping did not check the refrigerator because the prior guest has left their half eaten food in there. The bathroom floor was dirty. Parking was suppose to be free but I ended up having to pay.
10,Worst experience! Be aware they charge additional day by making up the time you left so they can add another resort fee on your final bill.  We left the room at 12pm with a confirmed late check out for a flight at 1:30pm and they charge us saying we left the room at 2pm . Physically impossible to be in 2 places at once! And the rooms are dirty with banged up walls and furniture.  I had better stay and service at Days Inn tbh.
40,Entire staff unfailingly polite and helpful.2nd toilet in bathroom was nice surprise. Our party arrived early so valet stowed our luggage later delivered to our rooms. Only gripe was the blackjack table. I had an 11 doubled down against a dealers 3 ‚Ä¶got a 10 card‚Ä¶21 dealer busts at 22 I won ..well no ..dealer says a 22 is a ‚Äúpush‚Äù and I don‚Äôt win ..utter BS
50,OK. From my perspective and I read a lot of reviews. It‚Äôs what has made TripAdvisor so great. Caesar‚Äôs Las Vegas is fantastic!! Our room is superb. We‚Äôre in the Augustus Tower with a view of the pool. The place is immaculate. We love it. The front desk was VERY courteous and offered us upgrades. Yes Caesar‚Äôs is a warhorse property but I‚Äôve wanted to stay here for years. I worked as a busboy at the Sahara in 1966! The year Caesar‚Äôs opened. No regrets. Love this place.
10,On the surface this casino/hotel looks nice. However they try to nickel and dime you for everything! We spilled some Gatorade on the mattress and they billed us over $1000 to replace the entire mattress. The manager lied to us repeatedly. There are plenty of other hotels on the strip.
10,My husband picked up a Fuji water and placed it right back down not knowing there were sensors on everything. We were charged $9.75 by the hotel for a water we never opened or consumed. I told the front desk twice and was told they would ‚Äúinvestigate‚Äù almost 2 weeks later I still haven‚Äôt been refunded for that water and I also tried calling and the operator never picks up. Word to wise if you do not plan to consume anything from their mini bar do not touch it. They lied about refunding me and I doubt ever investigated. I will never stay at this hotel again! Plus there was hair on the floor in the bathroom as soon as we checked in.
30,I came here to attend a conference. The hotel was close to the venue. The check in was extremely slow. I was very tired after a long flight. The line was moving very slowly. When I first talked the check-in staff she asked me whether I want to pay $50 for a room upgrade. Since I traveled on business I could't change the room price so I said No. Then she told that the room I made the reservation was not available so she would give me an upgrade for free. Interesting had I said yes earlier I would spend $50 a night for the upgrade. The room size was a typical two queen bed room. The bed was not leveled it tilted to one side. One night I was trying to reach my phone on the night stand I fell from the bed and hitting the nigh stand and I got hurt pretty bad. It is an OK stay but nothing really stand out about the room. The other thing was they limited to 2 devices to connect to the internet. After 2 device they will charge $14.99 for each additional device. I have never seen this before. Also they have bar in the room it has drink and snacks. Of course they will charge if you use any of item. Also they stock drink in the refrigerator. They stated if you put any personal item in the refrigerator they will charge you $70. Wow so many traps....
30,Traveled for work conference. Internet/WiFi was horrible. The construction detours seemed poorly thought out as taxi drop off was as far from reception as possible and getting to the taxi stand required circuitous navigation outside. I‚Äôm sure this is temporary but it was ridiculous and I enjoy walking generally. Service and food were excellent. Fitness center was challenging to find but very nice. Accommodations we‚Äôre fine but the poor WiFi though would keep me from coming back with kids (Netflix!) or for business.
20,"I have stayed in Vegas numerous times. Never at the Caesar's. I will say this this ranked as one of my worst stays in Vegas thus far. I took my kids (had to long story) so that added to the stress but this review is not taking that part of the stay into consideration.    At first I had screaming children in line for check-in. A room was confirmed available but there was a $40 fee for this. I was about to wait but the screaming intensified so I paid the $40. For the sake of my sanity and the other individuals in line I would have thought that this would be complementary but it wasn't. Small issue but that set the tone.    When I initially called and booked my room I confirmed the distance of the ""Caesars Form"" and it was on site. Wrong. This was a conference hall almost a 15 minute walk away. I could have stayed at Harrah's for a third of the cost and a 5 minute walk.    Then the reservation was mixed up and my key cards were deactivate on our 2nd night. This cause y wife 2 children and babysitter to wait in the hall for security to open the door. This was not any fault of ours. Just a computer booking error. Okay fine. I understand mistakes. But I did not understand the 2 hour + wait to open the door with a breast feeding wife 3 trips to the hotel lobby desk and some aggressive conversations.    Lets just say that I could have stayed at the Bellagio for the same price. I specifically paid the premium and ""upgraded room"" so that I could have the convivence of not walking and my kids could have a decent clean place to stay for a few days. I was surprised to see this as so different. I was in the worst wing (i feel) and I was forced to walk endlessly.    Excuse the rambling but I had to explain some of my stay. I could go on but I am keeping this short. If you want to know more I will definitely reply."
20,So much construction out side. Unfriendly staff Room had a terrible view of the HVAC system. Grout in the room was filthy dressers were chipped very poor looking bathroom door was broken wouldn‚Äôt lock no fan system Kureg was disgusting spent 45 minutes cleaning it out! And over all the room was very small.
20,Our jacuzzi tub was not working. Called the front desk who offered to send a maintenance but I was done and it was late. Water damage on ceiling. $50 fee to check in before 4pm. No courtesy whatsoever.
30,My wife (76) and I (70) arrived at the hotel at 2:05 p.m. We were told the room was ready but if we wanted to check-in before 3:00 there would be a $40 early check-in fee. I was told if we didn‚Äôt want the charge we could walk around for an hour and then check-in. I explained that both my wife and I were in our 70s tired from our travel from Texas and just wanted to get to our room and relax for a while. The hotel clerk said then the charge would be necessary. I was upset but tired so I told the clerk to just add the charge. Later in the week I went back to the front desk and spoke to a manager about the situation and asked for the charge to be waive. After much discussion the manager said he could not. This is a terrible policy. It should be modified. I completely understand having an early check-in fee for travelers who call ahead asking for a guaranteed early check-in because the hotel has to do extra to get the room ready sooner than normal. I also understand if I arrive early and there is no room available that I would obviously have to wait. However when a traveler arrives early and a room of the type they reserved is ready for occupancy there is no extra effort required on the part of the hotel so there should be no early check-in fee (i.e. penalty) assessed. This modification to the policy would make it fair since the room would be available. This would be a smart customer service change. The inflexibility of the manager to not waive the fee from my bill after my explanation was very disappointing.
30,Besides the guest Host and Tiffany the check out clerk these 2 lady‚Äôs are super rude and shouldn‚Äôt be working around guests. They promised and no delivery. Seems like everyone is in a bad mood. I would never come back to stay here at Caesar‚Äôs again . No one seems to know anything around here.
40,Strange I read the multitude of negative reviews. I almost backed out on going. However I‚Äôm glad I did go. My best advice to you if you are going to stay at the Caesar‚Äôs Palace do your research. Look at their website. See what is offered in the room you booked and be prepared. If you expect the worse and are wrong (as I was) you will be okay. Print out their floor plan map. You will get lost several times during your stay. All in all I had a good time.    I was originally booked in a Forum Tower‚Äôs room. In researching the rooms in the Forum Tower I realized that these are the least expensive rooms. Caesar‚Äôs website stated these rooms did not have coffee pots (so I brought instant coffee) hairdryer (so I brought mine) and housekeeping daily would cost extra.    I was upgraded to a Julius Tower‚Äôs room. [I don‚Äôt remember why they did that (sorry). I didn‚Äôt ask for it and didn‚Äôt want to pay extra for the upgraded however I wasn‚Äôt charged for the upgrade.] I did have a coffee pot but no coffee (no problem because I had brought instant coffee from home) it did have a hairdryer and housekeeping did come everyday at no extra charge. My room (room 870) was clean the bed comfortable and the view? I don‚Äôt think I even looked out of the window. I came to play the slots and only needed a room to relax and get out of the congestion of the common areas.    The only grouchy person I dealt with was the check-in employee. But in his defense I was probably a little grouchy myself after reading all the negative reviews I wasn‚Äôt sure I wanted to be there. I hate all the nickel and diming the hotel does. I don‚Äôt like the high resort fee early check-in fee late check-out fee coffee in the room fee the loaded refrigerator with expensive items that if you dare move one to make room for your drink you are charged a fee. OH! I almost forgot they charge a room deposit. For me for four nights it was $600! Thankfully it was cancelled when I checked out. All the restaurants were expensive (Be sure to ask in advance on the price of the buffet. I heard it is $80 per person! However I don‚Äôt do buffets. I‚Äôll eat way too much and will be miserable! LOL) I ate in the ‚ÄúFood Hall‚Äù near the Forum Tower. Yes they were a little pricey but a lot cheaper than the restaurants and good enough.    I played the slots won a little bit and lost a lot. I did use the Total Rewards player‚Äôs card but I didn‚Äôt earn enough to eat for free. Strange. I go to casinos in Laughlin West Wendover and Reno and always use their player‚Äôs card and always have enough points daily to eat for free. (If I were asked what my number one negative comment was it would be this.)
20,"We recently stayed (11/29 to 12/2) at Caesars Palace. We upgraded to a ""Palace Premium Room"". We were really excited about staying here usually stay at Ballys or Paris but they had great rates. One of the reasons we upgraded the room was it had a coffee maker. We thought it would be so much easier than standing in long lines for coffee in the mornings. We couldn't find the coffee pods next to the coffee maker they were FOR SALE next to the candy in the room for $15 for 4 pods! (Not enough for our 3 night stay). Very cheap and tacky to charge for coffee pods for Premium upgraded room. The rugs were worn and had areas of separation trip hazard.  The bathroom was big and nice but the separate toilet room smelled like a sewer.  Also we were given ONE bar of soap for 2 sinks a shower and a separate tub. Casino had poor signage to find your way around. The taxi drop off was by the front door but pickup was a LONG walk away. Not great in the dark or with suitcases on checkout. We looked on their website when booking and it stated they keep one pool OPEN year round. When we checked in all pools were closed for the season. Hubby has back issues and was looking forward to low impact exercises. They sent us an email to review our stay and it stated the wrong hotel Ballys. Probably first and last time at Caesars Palace for us!"
10,Hotel team members were unpleasant and rude. We were unaware of the construction in and around the building and it made getting around very difficult. We have stayed here many times but will not return any time soon after this visit. Sorry Caesars you are off the list!
10,I reserved my room 3 months in advance and let them know that my sister was insolent dependent and Had to have a refrigerator in the room.They refused to give us one After I was promised I would get one I had to get up and set my alarm every 3 hours to make sure I got ice to put her insulin in our whole stay.. We got no free play. No dinner voucher. We got nothing. It took an hour to get a drink.never will I stay again
40,I stayed here for 5 nights and was a bit worried after reading the negative reviews but i found the hotel to be ok. I stayed in the Julius tower. The room was cleaned every day and had an easy check-inthe hotel is huge and you need a bit of time to find out where every thing is. Parts of the hotel are being renovated. Enjoyed the stay but can do without the resort fees. There are some homeless people hanging around but they keep themselves to themselves. There is a strong smell of marijuana around as it is legal.
30,We booked a ‚Äústrip view‚Äù room for our 25th anniversary thinking that we would upgrade to something a little nicer. Our room had a view of a parking lot roofs and back of house operations - no strip view as advertised. When we complained they had no rooms to upgrade us to and comp‚Äôd us $25 per night. We were more than a little disappointed. Set your expectations low.
50,I‚Äôm diamond plus status and have been consistently blown away by Eric‚Äôs ability to go above and beyond. He always has a great attitude and is extremely empathetic to each and every person he interfaces with. He is a big reason why I have such strong loyalty to Caesars Palace. -Roy
20,At first glance Caesars Palace appears to be the crown Jewel of the Las Vegas strip. I have always desired to stay in the hotel since my first visit 20 years ago. I finally coughed up the money to pay their very expensive prices to see what it is like to stay in a $450 per night hotel. When entering the hotel you are welcomed with their grand lobby that flows into the casino with the strong smell of cigarette smoke. It is obvious that their ventilation system does not work and that they still permit smoking indoors while newer hotel/casino's such as the Cosmopolitan have outright banned smoking.    Getting into the old elevators that look like they were built out of plywood in the 1970's we are taken to our rooms without the need for a room key to access our floors. This is a big security risk as anyone off the streets can get to any room.    Now entering your room you are presented with a very well worn interior that is in my opinion not even luxury. The bed is comfortable so its good enough for sleeping in but paying for a room at $450 for just good enough is not right. Of course they can say location location location and that is all they have up to this point.    The shower was only good in the morning as they always ran out of hot water in the evenings. I am not sure how this was missed as part of the original design.    The hotel has a resort fee of $50 and when i was there the pools spa and everything else was closed. So why the resort fee? well they offer Wi-fi right? well not if you have more than 2 devices which anyone does. I was there for a business trip with my partner and we could only put our phones on the network without having to pay $15 per day per device extra. So where does my resort fee go?    Room service is also a joke I tried to order breakfast to the room and the fee to bring it to the room as just as much as the food itself.    This hotel needs a major overhaul and needs to get with the times.    My commentary is not over exaggerating or purposely trying to put the hotel in a bad light what I am saying is what it is and nothing more. I would have had a better experience at many other hotels at a lower price
40,Room was comfortable and clean albeit quite pricey. Easy access to the strip. Bit of a maze to find your way round on day one but after that it was easy enough! Was in Vegas for a conference and Caesars did the trick! Only negatives were for some reason my room wasnt cleaned on the penultimate day some of the barstaff could be a little more friendly (and less officious!) and the smokey atmosphere downstairs is a bit off putting. In this day and ages it wouldnt be so hard to create a non-smoking area of bars and games surely?
10,"I hadn't been to Vegas for a few years - pre Covid. We were there week of 11/30/21 for 3 nights. Prices have exploded to say the least. And you are charged for everything. At Caesars Cafe Americano $2 extra for parmesan cheese! $100 Rib Eye. One of the lamps in our room did not work and they couldn't fix. They have a ""welcome"" package on top of the credenza. If you pick something up and look at it - you are charged. The items have sensors on them. Crazy. We wanted to leave early but could not arrange flights. We will not be back to Vegas anytime soon and absolutely not to Caesars."
10,This hotel has forgot what service should be. Rooms were decorated from 1990's. Pathetic. I had a one of the most expensive suites and would have happily traded it for a simple AirBnB. I will never stay here again.
20,A huge let down. Asked multiple times for a refrigerator for medications-never got one. Bathroom floor was always sticky carpets were dirty and had to repeatedly ask for soap for the bathroom. Ridiculous.
40,Reservations made over 2 months in advance paid extra through Caesars verses 3rd party booked 2 rooms that THEY ASSURED ME THE ROOMS WOULD BE TOGETHER AND WE CONFIRMED A DAY IN ADVANCE. ROOMS WERE 30 ROOMS APART. 1 room had an adjoining room that had another party in the room that partied at 3:00 AM! This was VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE 2 ROOMS WERE TOGETHER and Caesars reassured me they would be and they were not. Our next trip to Vegas we will be staying at a different hotel!. Everywhere you want to go in Caesars is a hike to get to if you have a walking or breathing problem. NEVER TAKE AN ADJOING ROOM UNLESS YOU HAVE BOTH ROOMS!!!!
30,Terribly rude man at checkin - when we declined an upgrade wldnt waive a $60 early checkin fee. We used express checkin w/o a fee. Construction is awful.  No coffee - no pool - no perks - $59 resort fee??
10,Our stay began with having to pay a first time ever early check in fee of $75 and it went downhill from there - Vegas is so expensive that we won‚Äôt be back ever again. $10 diet colas $8 beers are just examples of the new overpriced Las Vegas! Greed is alive and well in Sin City.
20,We have been going to Vegas every year for last 20 .except the obvious COVID closure time. This is by far the most disappointing. Room was ok but nothing special in Vegas standards. Had to call 3 times in a week to get WiFi issues resolved. Our room 876 in julius tower wasn‚Äôt the best location as it was right next to a service door for housekeeping and man did the housekeeping bang that door way late and way early!  The front of the hotel is closed for cars due to renovations and we waited 45 mins to pull up to valet park on the first night. As instructed by guest service manager hector tipote who called me back as we had a wheelchair and luggage and needed to know the best way to check in. This cost us $50. When we eventually got to valet it was the worst valet experience we have encountered in Vegas. No welcome no checking in just a miserable guy who took the luggage (and tip) with very little interest in offering help or direction.  Check in was good as was the lovely lady who checked us in. Yumi (pity hotel didn‚Äôt have more staff like her)  Room was ok but nothing special. Clean would sum it up.  Now let me tell you about self park. The garage absolutely stinks of dope and it appears lots of folks use it for that reasonprior to hitting the casino. We witnessed on a couple of occasions hobos smoking stuff in a glass pipe in there. Not once did we see security in there so be careful.    On check out we went to reclaim our luggage While standing outside at the bell desk obviously invisible as two guys working in their brown uniforms ignored us as they were watching something funny on a Mobile phone. Just rude  unhelpful and uninterested. 9which sums up the staff as a whole)    All over the casino and forum shops signs say wearing a mask is mandatory however we were stunned at the fact we never seen anyone enforcing these legal requirements.    So to the management you guys seriously need to look into customer care cause without guests there ain‚Äôt no Caesar‚Äôs. We agreed on day 4 we wouldn‚Äôt rebook another stay at this hotel.    Staff clearly are unhappy working there and boy does it show. book somewhere else on the strip you will be glad you did. Give this one a big miss.
10,40 plus people in line for check-in and only 4 clerks. 45 minutes later we were in our room without a view as requested. Tried to get it resolved but when they called for a manager she never showed up ‚Äì another 30 minute wait. Got fed up waiting and gave up. Every door in the room had dirty finger prints on them. Dining table side table and coffee tables had water rings and grimy smudge marks. The same for all the counter tops in the bedroom. Half of the lamps didn‚Äôt work because they weren‚Äôt plugged in. Two of the 3 device chargers were broken. The L part of the L-shaped sofa was hanging off and all the pillows on the sofa looked as if someone had sat against them not fluffed up and even. Every chair in the place including around the table were askew. The one and only clock in the bedroom continued to flash couldn‚Äôt get it set called for maintenance and no one showed the entire time we were there. Bath and hand towels were worn and scratchy. Ran out of hot water mid way through a shower. The only good thing about the whole room was that the bed was comfortable. Never and I mean never will I stay at a room in Caesar‚Äôs Palace again. Everything felt dirty and definitely not sanitized. So disgusting.
20,I‚Äôm very disappointed that there are signs everywhere that indicate you must wear mask and yet I have seen no one enforythis. Way to many people gambling and walking around with no mask on. If your not going to enforce this then take down the signs.
50,enjoyable stay at a beautiful property - Christmas decorations were great! Would like to come back when I can stay longer and maybe when it's warmer. Great choices of places to eat especially Cafe Americano
30,We paid for the palace premium with the couch they put us in a room that was not like the picture. We had to make them change it after they really didn‚Äôt want to but we paid extra so they had to. Dwight the manager was not helpful at all and I must say this will probably be our last time staying there
20,"We visit Las Vegas regularly this past visit (Thanksgiving 2021) was most disappointing. The rooms were great at CP (as always) but the level of customer service was poor at best. Employees were rude top to bottom and of very little interest in treating me or my family like a valued customer. I visit Las Vegas regularly and have a full understanding of the cadence my disappointment has nothing to do with not understanding how things work there.    There is no doubt Cesar's mantra is now (and was never in the past) something like ""Do whatever it takes to recoup lost revenue/profit during the past 18 month COVID period and we really don't care about our guests!"" It was obvious in the casino direct hotel shops sports book (particularly) and restaurants (probably the worst) of all regarding attitude and attentiveness to ""valued"" guests.    A few specific disappointments of note: (1) Front desk team was slow confused and unprepared for the volume of guests (2) Paying for seats in the sports book was bad enough but standing in line for 10-15 minutes to make a wager makes that seat fee even more disappointing (3) The Bacchanal Buffet is run horribly and the staff does not communicate or really care about you or your family getting into the restaurant (4) Many of the stores never opened in the 4 days we there and (5) Paying to use the fridge in your room Cesars how short sited we wonder be back.    I have stayed their many times before and have always been pleased and also spread my visits to other casinos ... Cesars headed down hill fast and they make no bones about the fact they do not care about you and they want to squeeze every dime they can from their ""customers"" and do nothing to make them feel like ""valued guests""."
10,After a long day we arrived back to our room at 6:30pm only to have the room not cleaned even though we requested housekeeping for the duration of our stay. When we asked why it was not cleaned yet we were told housekeeping was based on availability and they were short staffed. Fuming we went to talk to a manager Javier who said the best he can do is make the request and see when housekeeping would be ready. The day before when we checked in we found that our room only had 3 towels even though we had booked the room for 4 adults. When we phoned and asked for another towel we were told that towels are based on availability. After a lot of back and forth they finally brought one. So yeah. Save your money and go somewhere else.
30,Ordering any food a Caesar's palace is 3x more expensive than walking out the door taking a cab off the strip and getting great food and service at a decent price. I don't know what Caesar's is thinking. Free rooms but $300.00 a day for food is a rip off.
10,We stayed in the Palace tower. Great 500 sf room with jacuzzi but the rooms are connecting rooms sharing a thin leaky door with the hotel room next door. Unfortunately for my family a pothead was our neighbor and the marijuana stench would bleed through the connecting door to ours. At the middle of the night my kids were awaken to the sounds of prostitution (we know because the connecting door provides no soundproofing and we can hear every word said). Calling the front desk and security did nothing except getting us hollow promises of sending security to deal with the situation. SECURITY NEVER CAME over our 4 nights stay. Maybe they‚Äôre invisible. We were lied to by the front desk staff and three managers over 4 nights about the neighboring guest having checked out when the whole ordeal would repeat again the next night. In that way they trapped us in this hell over 4 nights. They would not let us switch rooms and made all sorts of excuses to make our request for a room change difficult to accommodate. First time and the last time ever at Caesar‚Äôs Hell. Cleaning staff acknowledges the pot smoking happens all the time which is why they routinely carry fragrant sprays to remove the stench- so I guess it‚Äôs a normal activity totally sanctioned by Caesars. Outside of the room the entire facility is very large and walking from parking to hotel room could easier take you 10 mins. The garage elevators don‚Äôt work and there‚Äôs always a huge line and wait for the garage elevators. Yes you‚Äôll be staying in the middle of the Vegas strip but what‚Äôs the point if you can‚Äôt get a good nights sleep or even get out of the parking garage. AVOID CAESAR‚ÄôS PALACE IN LAS VEGAS.
40,You know it's still the dark ages when you have to travel hundreds of miles to visit a Roman bath.    Caesar's is a shining example of old growth casinos who have managed to keep up with the Joneses.    That said their infrastructure is starting to fracture. The elevator displays don't work any more and there's no communication between the parking garages and the front desk. The result is that they prep your room key and tell you it's good to use for ingress to and egress from the parking garage yet it never works at the parking gate. You end up calling for service every time and sometimes wait 15 minutes to get out through the gate. You know the departments have fragmented otherwise those working the parking garages would inform those working the front desk and the problem would get solved. This same sort of fragmentation marked the recent demise of Sears in which middle management seemed to have just vanished. There was no one to go to with problems needing resolution and no coordination between departments. No one was minding the shop.    Checking in. The desk attendant types for literally 15 minutes. What the heck is she typing? It's a guest checking in not a dark and stormy night.    Checking out. Fully automated yet fully manual as well. They send you an email with a link to follow for checkout. This doesn't work so you try the TV. There's no longer a checkout path on the TV so you try the automated kiosks at the front desk. First it's out of service then it says to go through an attendant.    In the old days you'd just go straight to the front desk and speak with an attendant. Now you have to go through all of the latest automated checkout systems first THEN go to the front desk and speak with an attendant. That's not how progress is supposed to work.
30,"This was our second trip here in as many years. Same hotel same tower (Octavius) same room type (Premium King). 1)The check-in process was lees convenient than it could have been. Our room wasn't ready until well after 6pm and the kiosks they have in place for easy room key retrieval were not working properly. 2)Once we get to the room we are greeted by one sink that has gross gunk and residue caked around the bowl and drain stopper removed like it had just been clogged and another sink that was thoroughly clogged. 3)The room temp would not get below what felt like 74 degrees the entire trip regardless of what the thermostat was set on (we all have our preferences I prefer 70). Keep in mind it's November so it's in the 40's outside at night. If I could have just cracked a window I would have. 4)The state of the room was sub-par. Much of the furniture and walls were covered in scratches dings and chipped wood/finish. The vents were caked in dust. The mini-fridge was open on arrival with a few empty slots (which they would try to charge me for at checkout to make an awesome cherry on top of the whole experience). And the tv quality appeared to be a few levels below 480p with frequently interrupted signal. Not a huge deal but there were a few times in our several nights stay that we wanted to just relax in the room. Finally when trying to check out using the phone in the room the connection quality was so bad that it kept cutting in and out. Again not a big deal but Unfortunately Underwhelming. We will be trying a different hotel on our next trip to town.    Side note our first visit was fine. The only real complaint we had that time was the funky cheesy gunk that came out of the jets when my wife tried to run a bath in the jacuzzi (DON""T USE THE JACUZZI)."
10,AWFUL experience. Me and my two friends stayed at the Cesar's and ended up very disappointed. First of all check in took more than 45 min and when we complained they said it was because it was Thanksgiving day. We've been traveling to Vegas every year since 3 years ago and haven't had that problem in any of the other hotels.    Then we booked a room called DELUXE which had nothing to do with the name or with the pictures we saw online. The rooms are way old and way small and there was even a picture missing on the wall. When we complained the manager tried to imply that this was not important.    Got some coffee and scones at Starbucks one night and the lady who served us just threw the bags with the scones to us. Super rude.    We've been to Cosmopolitan and Venetian and we're seriously expecting so much more from CP. Would definitely recommend you to find another hotel which for the same price will make you feel welcome as a guest and not just a number or an amount of money.
10,The staff was inefficient! No housekeeping charged for parking (when part of room charge) and then charged again instead of crediting - employees refuse to deal with the situation. Slowest registration process and extra charges not indicated. Overall attitude of the employees was not welcoming. Very disappointed- will never go back to this hotel.
10,"My wife and I were really excited about staying here during our Thanksgiving trip. The facilities were nice and clean but they immediately put a $700 hold on our CC. When we went to question it they said it was for incidentals. We questioned several upgrades they gave us and were told it was a flat rate of $50. at check out we learned that it was $50 per day and also included a ""resort fee"" of another $50. We had already pre-paid for the room before coming and were hit with another $500 in charges at checkout. All were ""upgrades"" and ""resort Fees"" that we were not informed of at check in. We will be staying elsewhere in future trips.    The front desk staff was rude when we questioned them about the charges. (We were not being rude to them just asking legitimate questions.)    It was also made known to us during the trip that Caesar‚Äôs is the busiest of all the casinos so if you hate crowds stay away."
30,I was very excited for my trip this month. I was sad that room had to heat thankfully they moved us to another room but we were downgraded. Smoking is allowed everywhere instead of designated areas. Pool was closed for the season. Very disappointed.
10,Rooms are in need of repair and need improved cleaning. First room had black mold throughout shower hairs on the wall stains on wall by toilet and worn carpet and furnishings. Complained and got moved to a second room. Although it was cleaned heavily before we moved with a strong Clorox smell upon arriving there was a hole and water stain in ceiling 8-9 foot crack in ceiling toilet that continuously ran the entire time and had trouble flushing and very worn carpet.
10,We arrived late Friday night technically Saturday 11/27/21 around 3am. We got a suite for 2 nights but I couldn‚Äôt sleep for more than 30 mins because the suite‚Äôs bed mattress was warped so bad that half of the bed was much higher than the other half and you literally slept like you were on a mound. My back hurt even after taking 2 Tylenol with 2 Advil at the same time. Within a couple hours of trying to get thru it I contacted the Caesar‚Äôs front desk and requested they exchange the mattress or bed and they agreed to do it by 1pm Saturday 11/27/21. When we came back Saturday night to sleep Caesar‚Äôs had done nothing to fix the broken mattress. I tried to sleep again because by this time I hadn‚Äôt slept for 2 days. No matter how tired I was the broken mattress kept me in awake. We ended up just leaving at 2:15am even though I had a long 4+ hour drive home that was hard because of lack of sleep. CEASAR‚ÄôS CHARGED ME OVER $1300 for 2 nights and when I asked a manager to comp both nights because Caesar‚Äôs broken bed didn‚Äôt allow me to sleep which is the only reason we even got a room to sleep the best he was willing to do was knock off about $300 or he would comp me another suite for 2 nights in the future. I rejected his offer to comp a future suite. Why pay now for a damn suite that I couldn‚Äôt use because it effectively lacked a useable bed? This is disgraceful for a major resort like Caesar‚Äôs. Disgraceful. This isn‚Äôt about the money especially since I‚Äôm actually a rated player that plays significant sums. It is the principle and the fact that Caesar‚Äôs is mistreating a guest because they didn‚Äôt think I was an important guest. Awful. Terrible. Disgraceful.
20,Our recent trip to Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas was a BIG disappointment! We reserved two Premium Rooms in the Octavius Tower. One room was a king the other two queens. In general both rooms were in poor condition compared to other hotels we stay at and specifically to other rooms at Caesar's we have stayed in. It seems like we got rooms that have never been remodeled and maybe were in poorer condition than most. We requested two rooms close together and did get two rooms on the same floor fairly close by. Otherwise the check in clerk did not do us any favors even though we did give him a tip at the start of check in. Some of the most glaring issues were the ripped up headboards general lack of cleanliness in the bathroom broken furnishings worn baseboards etc. We had some nasty whitish stain on the vanity and a broken glass left for us that were appalling! Many spots on the floor of who knows what a clear indicator that the floor had not been mopped or cleaned at all before we arrived. We may not ever be back it was that bad. The days of Caesar's being one of the best places to stay are apparently over! Service by the front desk was very poor. The clerk did not bother to ask about our parked car and as a result were forced to pay $30 to get out of the garage. When we followed up with exactly the same person who checked us in regarding having to pay when our parking should have been free he said to dispute it with our credit card company. How ridiculous!!! It was precisely HIS fault! Absurd rude and unbelievable for a place that used to pride itself on customer service.
10,We have visited Las Vegas for over 35 years and stayed at many casino hotels. We always fancied Caesars and stayed there for 8 nights. It vwas dreadful. The first room we were given in Julius Tower was dirty damaged carpet cigaretts burns on the furniture the phone was filthy. Upon complaining we were moved to a bit better room in Augustus Tower. Some rooms had visitors with dogs. Four in one room on our floor. Disgusting. The casino was file with cigarette and cigar smok so we refused to gable there. Masks were obligatory but at least 25 per cent of customers were not wearing them in this hotel massed with people. The prices for food was outrageous a cup of coffee was $7.58. Never again at Caesars. We stayed our final night at Bellagio next door which was far far better than Caesars. BEWARE. DO NOT USE THE MINI BAR/ fridge at Caesars you will be charged $75 just for opening the door and the full cost of any item you pick up even just to look at the label even though you replace it unused. They have mini bar police who will be at your door in a flash if you use the fridge at all.
10,"Resort was over crowded we had to play what machines were left in the casino which were ones no one wanted. Lines were long for everything. Cigarette smoke was thick. Buffet was ridiculously priced at $173 for breakfast buffet for 2 people so we ate off the premises. They charge $75.00 if you use the mini refrigerator for personal use. Resort fees have tripled. Their is an Asian shrine to one of their God's on the front of the property which is offensive for Americans. We had to walk miles to our room and we are 60. I've been here many times before and enjoyed Caesars but this was miserable. Room was never cleaned; carpets are filthy and old; plus we paid a lot for ""resort fees"" for amenities we never used. Caesars do not use the ""Resort fees"" to upkeep their property. I'll never return to stay at Caesars. THE CROMWELL was a much better place to play and stay as well as South Point."
20,Rooms are not been kept up. First time that I have been dissatisfied with the appearance of the room. Caesars management you could do better don‚Äôt let this hotel go down. Room was on the Octavius tower.
50,First time in Vegas and because of Gemma I will be back! Excellent customer service and provided excellent restaurant recommendations. Hella Kitchen was great!!!!The Caesars palace is the place to be!
50,I came to Caesars palace and was helped my Tomek. He had the best customer service and wanted to ensure we had the best stay. He gave us several options that best tailored to our needs and laid out all options with out rushing us. He truly went above and beyond to ensure we had the best room at the best rates. I will becoming back to Caesars palace and will make sure I work with Tomek again. Our room was awesome and a great view.    Thanks Tomek!
10,Over price room bad customer service hidden restore fee they charge $51 per day they also charge $15 parking per hr. When we check in at 4pm and arrive our hotel room at 4:30pm the house keeping cart blocked or door because the room still not ready. We have to wait 15min outside of our room. We were stay at this hotel for 2 days at second day we can not connect to their internet we try call couple times for support they just put me on hold for 1hr still no one pickup the phone it's really waste my valuable time when I go check out find out they charged me $102 for resort fees I try to complaint to their management end up they say they only can refund me one day resort fee. If you have choice don't stay at this hotel.
10,I reserved 1 night and asked to upgrade when we checked in. They told me it would just be an additional $100. I checked my statement the next day and they charged me $905. Since it was Thanksgiving nobody was able to assist. I'm still having issues correcting this billing error. I had to contact my credit card company to try and and see if I can stop this fraudulent charge. Not happy with their service on this issue. Check your billing statements on your credit card if you stay here.
30,Booked trip for pool with kids advertised as heated no indication that they close for the season. Insensitive front desk staff escalation to management proved no better. Great location but not impressed with how it‚Äôs run.
30,First of all the location is very good with being in the middle of the strip and has a fancy brand name that everyone recognizes.    But other than that this place is not all at worth the hype and here‚Äôs why.    Rooms: The rooms are very mediocre. Something you‚Äôll get at a nicer holiday inn or at a hotel a quarter of its price. Everything from bedding to appliances to facilities is average.    Checkin: Long wait times for check in and checkout unless you pay extra. This is on top of the premium you pay to stay here which to me is outrageous. Staff and customer service is very average as well.    Amenities: The place is huge. It‚Äôll take you several minutes to get from one place to other. Foreg it‚Äôll take you 10-15 mins to get to your self parked parking spot or to the strip from your room. I wish there were better signage to guide us but there is very less of these.    I have got better service and comfort out of other hotels in the strip. This is not something that I personally recommend if you are spending that much money on your stay.
30,It was ok..I wish there was notice when I first made the reservation that there was construction ongoing on the property. There was such a mess getting there and a lot of walking from being dropped off by the rideshare area. I got to hotel at about 1130a-12n and checked in. I had to wait till actually 4p when my from was ready. They make you wait till the actual check in time to give you the room key. Yea I know people reading this are probably like so what. Well I‚Äôll tell you it used to be that even tho check in time was a certain time your room was almost always ready before then. Yea you can pay the $85 early check in but no I‚Äôm not getting scammed into paying more money on top of the resort fees that you can‚Äôt even take advantage of because the pool is not available. Clearly it shows that the rooms are ready but they want to scam me to pay more money no way. And with the way these hotels and restaurants have been suffering through Covid I would have expected just a bit more better service to their guests. It is better for them to get their guests in the room so they can get comfortable right away to start spending money. I had to wait and carry heavy tote bag because I didn‚Äôt want to leave it in the valet and risk something getting stolen. I left my luggage that‚Äôs about it. My room was somewhat clean but not all the way because there was a little bit of garbage that was left on the side of the bathroom maybe the cleaning person didn‚Äôt see it but it goes to thorough cleanliness. First and last stay at the Caesars. I like some of the restaurants which I‚Äôll keep coming back to but I‚Äôm not staying in this hotel again.
10,Do not stay here if you expect the old Caesars palace Rooms are worn we stayed in the Augustus tower and it definitely needs to be refurbished front entrance lobby being renovated horrible flow of traffic very crowded with people walking around down narrow hallways that are partitioned off because of the remodel customer service is nonexistent my advice would be to stay at the Bellagio or the Wynn hotels if you expect customer service this hotel has definitely taken a turn for the worse they actually got our bill very incorrectly wrong checking out overcharging and the resort fee is $45 plus tax which comes out to $51 which is ridiculous since the pool is closed which they said was complementary I don‚Äôt know what kind of resort this is but it‚Äôs not one that I‚Äôll ever stay out again do not stay here.
50,Fatima Ehlers is the best Host I have ever worked with. She is amazing. Caesar's Entertainment hired the right person. She helped us from the beginning to the end. Will consult with her everytime I book with Caesar's. EVERYTIME!!  -Bo
20,Where do I start? The room ventilation smelled smoky. The furniture was dusty. Environmental allergies were triggered. The toilet paper in the rooms were hard. Consider bringing your own toilet paper...The casino signs are confusing. Cash machines were out of order at inconvenient times and locations. They charged a resort fee even when the pool was closed.
10,My son w autism 22 birthday. We needed a plate for a cake I had delivered since the hotel couldn‚Äôt help us with a cake or anything for him. So we needed a plate and the hotel couldn‚Äôt even get a a plate. You couldn‚Äôt get anyone one the phone easily‚Ä¶ u had to send a text which was useless. Plus pool was closed said nothing on website when booking. You had to carry you own luggage to taxi site cause of construction. I‚Äôve been to Vegas a lot and I get Covid plates a part but I will probably never stay there again‚Ä¶. Belagio was above and beyond only a month prior to this visit!!!
30,As a cancer survivor I did not like the pot smoking and smoking in the hotel there was no policing of that and there were signs everywhere non-smoking hotel I would not stay at Caesars again! They charged a resort fee of $51.04 every day which included the gym and the pool however the pool was closed for the season. I feel they should charge the resort fee only for those that wish to use the gym and give them a pass key to get into it!
10,Check you bill before you check out to ensure they did not charge you extras from the minibar that you did not take. I went with a group--all of us had erroneous charges added. We were told the minibar is done by weight--if you knock something over (which is on top of the desk) you will be charged!
20,"We booked our room in Early September of this year and reserved a King bed. Once we arrived after getting off the plane we got our room keys and went to the room. We noticed it was not what we had reserved and showed the reservation confirmation to the check-in clerk. Dude had the balls to say ""Well it's first come first serve and since you didn't get here earlier you lost your reservation."" I told him I couldn't help that our flight landed late and he to use there were no king rooms free at this point. He then said due to the issue they gave us an upgraded room (which was the one we were assigned). I told him the bed was too small for the two of us which is why I reserved the king room. I could not believe that Ceasars operates on the idea that ""if you don't get here early your reservation means nothing."" Additionally the room itself wasn't very clean. There was a pile of dust near the door and the bathtub that was in the room had hair in it. We go to Vegas yearly but we will not go back to Ceasars due to this issue. Our friends stayed there as well as we all traveled together and they all said similar complaints from the customer service in regards to their rooms."
20,The resort fee was $51 a night. This is to use their high speed internet and for the use of their spa. Their pool is closed for the season though it was 70 degrees while we were there and it would have been nice to at least sit by the pool. There were no reservations available at any of the shows or restaurants. The room had broken cabinetry in the bathroom. My colleague's room rate was $109/night and mine was $139/night which was our conference rate. I booked my room before he did?? We were in the same level of room. When we went to check in using the self check in application our rooms were not ready and it was 6:00 p.m. To call or talk to someone in customer service is a joke. No one answers the phone for hours and you can't send an email unless you enable your browser. I think they make it difficult so you will give up. Which I have but sent this off as I'm not a happy customer.
20,"I was highly excited about my upcoming 70th Birthday trip to Las Vegas and staying at Caesars Palace. Upon our arrival @ approximately 2:45pm we jumped into UBER and off we went once arriving to the hotel we were very disappointed in knowing to had to haul our luggage from the parking area all the way to the entrance. I might add 3 women suffering from cancer this was quite a haul!! Finally we got in to the lobby only to find a 5 row of people trying to check when we approached the desk around 3:15 we were told we would have to pay a 75.00 fee each for early check in!! no thanks we said & asked if he could take our luggage or just check us in without the room and once again were told it would be a 75.00 fee and as far as the luggage we could take it to the bell hop which was located way back close to the parking lot. we said no and sat in the restaurant until 4:00. Once we hot to our rooms in the ""Palace"" building 2 of the rooms reeked of POT my room was OK So they had to move my sister-in-law and our friend to Octavus Bldg & they were satisfied. None of us drink so therefore we didn't read the small print of the refrigerator about there being a 75.00 a day charge for use of the refrigerator (we had put medicine bottled water and yogurt in the fridge. We did get that cleared up and they brought up a very small plug in fridge to hold our medicine. Now they charge you a 57.00 resort fee for the use of the gym and pool HOWEVER the pool was closed for the season and us ladies didn't visit the gym (I feel this fee should have been optional!"
30,I was disappointed with the front desk service. We arrived to check in after 11 pm and the lady at the front desk was bothered helping us. She never made eye contact with us and when I asked a few basic questions she rolled her eyes when answering them. The room was basic and could use a little upgrading exceptionally for the price we paid. It was also not the cleanest. I did call the front desk and complain about the experience but no one ever followed up. I did like the drive up section of the hotel for uber and Lyft and the hotel had some good dining areas. Overall my experience was fair but disappointing. .
30,I was invited to stay at Caesars for 4 free Nights didn‚Äôt end up being free was charged for three nights valet parking was not in the front of the hotel due to construction the room that they put me in was the farthest room you could put a customer in the Sink faucet and tub faucet or very hard to turn on or would not turn off and leaked The room was OK but I was expecting a lot more from Caesars I am an elite player at the golden nugget Which the golden nugget takes care of their players I guess Caesars has enough players that they don‚Äôt have to worry about it
20,This is a nice hotel with no microwave or coffee maker. The fridge was fully stocked with overpriced drinks. I have been in cheaper hotels with better amenities. The rooms was decorated poorly. The huge white sick was not attractive. The huge brown bulky closet was obnoxious. Save your money
10,Front desk staff not helpful or organized long long line yet half of the staff including managers chit chatting. 50 Buck resort fee and no pool come on. The front end of the hotel is under construction it would be nice to have assistance with luggage.
30,Pros: hotel is beautiful and location is central  Cons: room view I paid for was terrible. There was broken glass on the bathroom floor that pricked the bottom of my foot. Reached out to CS never responded
20,"Our first trip to Vegas... We arrived on Monday and the Uber dropped us off in an area that heavily stunk of trash. We had to walk a really long ways with our luggage to get to the check in point. After checking in we then had to walk (what felt like forever) to get to the tower we were staying at. Upon getting to the room we found pieces of the carpet missing (what happened to my premium room I had paid for?) As well as the make-up mirror was broken. Luckily the bed was comfy... We tried for 2 days to speak with someone at the rewards counter to get a card to gamble with and to get our bacchanal buffet pass I was supposed to receive with my Caesars credit card. I even had written proof I was supposed to receive this pass but they refused to give it to me stating they had changed the ""gifts"". With the poor customer service the amount of walking just to get to your room and the poor maintenance on the rooms I would not recommend staying at Caesars Palace."
10,We booked a specific room type months in advance and when we arrived the front desk clerk ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù us to a completely different room that we didn‚Äôt want and was in our opinion worse than the one we paid for. They were unwilling to make any changes refused to give us any credit told us all the other rooms were ‚Äúreserved‚Äù and were generally rude unhelpful and manipulative. They also asked us multiple times if we wanted housekeeping to which we replied yes multiple times and then they never showed up. Overall awful experience that ruined our very short stay. Would not recommend to anyone.
40,Great experience we will be back again.  We enjoyed the jacuzzi on our room. That is all I have to say. I just want to submit review. This is stupid to put limits on this box when I can say it in a few words.
30,"Were told julius tower was remodeled walls and carpets didnt reflect that. Bought an expensive dinner with left overs but coudnt use the locked refer without being chargedhad to throw out could not use the in room coffee pod maker without a charge for the pods. They dont even offer a complimentary coffee that you can get at a best western along with bfast. Instead we had to spend 21 bucks on a sm and med coffee and two small coffee cakes what a joke not to mention being told to put a face diaper on to order or walk around the stupid place. But my absolute fave was the joy of having to look at mildew at the back splash grout line and all the previously splattered spit along the sink side walls. Apparently cleaning isnt a priority just look at the hall walls and wood work. Looking forward to paying that 51.00 "" resort"" fee."
10,Poor experience from the start arrived to a torn up hotel parking lot and long walk to check in. Learned the pool is closed yet still being charged the 50 buck per day fee to use the resort. Manager comments it covers other things as well. Total give a sh*t attitude they are doing me a favor staying here. Many many other hotels in Vegas go find another one. Won‚Äôt be back.
20,"We have stayed at Caesar's Palace many times. This was the first stay post-COVID shut-down. They nickle-and-dimed us every step of the trip.  1. We began check in via the app. When we got to the mobile check-in kiosk it wouldn't let us complete check-in because my Caesars rewards was in my maiden name. The woman at the mobile kiosk help booth couldn't help us (& was very rude about it) & we had to walk to the other end of the hotel to wait in line to check in.  2. We get to the check-in counter & are offered two options - pay $75 for early check in (by just an hour or two) or pay $20/day for a room ""upgrade."" We paid $68 (after tax) to upgrade the room and just get a GD key.  3. We declined housekeeping & were not offered any type of incentive to do so - other Vegas hotels have given us food/drink credit for saving the water/labor/effort/etc.  4. We get to our room & there were items missing from the mini bar. I called the front desk to note the missing items so we wouldn't be charged for them. Thankfully we were not.  5. The mini-fridge would have cost us $75 to use for personal use so don't plan to bring back leftovers or keep any water bottles chilled.  6. We called down for extra pillows (the down pillows immediately deflate as soon as you lay on them) & they were out of pillows. In the entire hotel not one spare pillow...  7. I tried to use their Caesar's app to order food for pick up from the Pronto by Giada restaurant - they charged me $1 to go pick up the stuff myself & then asked how much I wanted to tip - srsly?  8. They brought back the in-room Keurig coffee machine - but you have to pay $20 to use the K-cups from the mini bar. Really?!  9. The TV guide didn't work; could not effectively watch TV while in our room getting ready or falling asleep - kept scrolling an only got through hotel-related channels or infomercials.  10. Never got a text or help from ""Ivy"" their mobile concierge service.  11. Noticed what appeared to be a bloody finger print on the door to the water closet. Gross.  12. Had a run-in with a homeless person at the Terra Bar just outside the hotel entrance near the main lobby. Hotel security was escorting him out of the hotel but some how fell far enough behind him that he had time to come up to me & pour water all over my phone that was sitting on the bar.  13. Self-parking instructions & payment upon checkout is unclear confusing & causes delay getting out of the structure.  We paid over $1500 for this experience."
20,"Well! I just stayed at Caesars the sixth (and last) time and what a disappointment. I stayed in an August Fountain View room. The line to check in was ridiculous - waited almost an hour then told there were no rooms until after 4:00 (their standard check-in time) - but for an extra $75 I could get an early check-in. We were so exhausted we did it. The highest floor they could give us was 14. The view was not the best fountain view but it was okay. The room itself was pretty bad. I read the August Tower was recently renovated (yeah right). The carpet was stained throughout the room every piece of furniture was worn and nicked the cabinet next to the minibar was broken the ottoman had a rip the toilet top was put on unevenly - even the elevators were dirty!    Caesars used to be the epitome of Vegas luxury but those days are sadly behind them. The place is sad. This type of shoddy room I would expect at Circus Circus but not at a place as storied and expensive as this. Add to that a construction project on the entrance which is a genuine pain - you have to walk through a construction path to enter the hotel and then go through a long maze to walk to get a taxi. Very inconvenient.    When I called the front desk to complain about the room they said I would have to wait in line downstairs to get a different room. No way I told them. Plus they would give me the same room type - a ""lateral move"" no upgrade. I told them that if this room was like this they all must be like this. Finally spoke to someone in guest services named Hymie who could only offer me $50 off my stay. I said ""How about just not charging me the early check-in fee?"" He agreed and I was not charged for that.    Oh - and when you check in they place a $400 hold on your credit or debit card. Huge pain especially since the charge takes up to 7 business days to come off.    As for the casino it stinks too! I only gambled there once this trip. The blackjack dealer was some oblivious lady who kept complaining to the pit boss that she did not get her break. He said she just had her break. She was paying no attention to the players. They should not be quibbling like this in front of customers. I lost $100 and did not gamble at Caesars the rest of my trip.    As for Covid rules nothing is enforced. There were several times I was on the elevator and people did not wear masks. Overall though most people were surprisingly good about mask wearing.    There is really nothing positive I can say about Caesars Palace. For over 20 years this was one of my two or three favorite spots in Vegas. Now it must be avoided."
10,Rooms are worn out smoked in and outdated. Phone service to front desk for help is non-existent. Vegas has so many other choices. Stay clear. I wont stay there again unless it undergoes a make over and they hire some more people.
20,If you like thousands of drunk kids running around while being loud and obnoxious this is the hotel for you. I am not sure why but Caesars Palace decided to run a special to attract students to stay. This is not the type of atmosphere that you pay premium prices for.
30,Stayed on the 4th floor and my room was next to a service room. All morning the carts would bang into the walls. The door to the hotel room would not close without my husband pulling at for a solid 10 seconds. The layout of this room was also inefficient with the rolling bathroom doors and glass shower doors that can be visible from anyone in the hallway. The closet also opened into the narrow hallway so if the doors were open you couldn‚Äôt get from the bathroom area to sleeping area. I hope the other towers are better.    Service associates were all very friendly.    My rewards card somehow deactivated. The card reprinters did not work and the lines for the desk were full.
30,The palace is absolutely massive we were disappointed that the pools were closed and they have very few small bite restaurants. However it is close to everything and very clean. Loved the shopping mall.
10,Didn‚Äôt sleep the first night as the jacuzzi turned on its roaring jets every 30 min or so- all night long. We called maintenance and they fiddled with it. We asked for a new room the next morning by 8 am and the front desk assured us they would call with the new room. 5 pm and no call. Had to wait in a long line to get a new room. Also- beware. $45 for resort fee but all 7 pools are closed. WiFi is spotty.
10,We stayed in the Augustus tower which is more expensive and the room was definitely not up to the Caesar brand.  Tub wall cracked and falling in 3 knobs missing on dresser finial missing on lamp phone didnt work chairs stained carpet had not been vacuumed no trash can in room bathroom towel ring was off and found in a drawer all furniture had scuff marks and scratches - these are a few items but I have pictures of all.  Called Guest Services and Kristin apologized and said we can have HK and Maintenance come (which Maint came into our room with the room occupied sign on the door) but who wants to be on vacation and have staff coming in and out?  I am very surprised that Caesars would think this room was acceptable for a guest to enter. We stayed at 2 other Vegas hotels during the week and this by far was the worst and we will not be back and will not recommend. Nothing else was done or communicated to see if we were satisfied when we checked out.    I realize this is a huge operation and being in the Hospitality business myself - little things do matter and I hope this review will cause some extra attention to be given to their rooms and guests satisfaction. Again I do have pictures if someone from Caesars would like to see them. I offered with Kristin but she didn't ask them to be sent.    The one great thing from our time at Caesars was the view and it was of the Bellagio fountains.
40,Nice property. For the price you would expect a friendlier staff. Half our interactions with hotel staff were very nice. Be prepared to be nickel and dimed. Arrived to check in at 3:45 p.m.. They wanted to charge a significate fee for early check in. Regular check in is at 4:00 p.m.. We were 15 minutes early. Did not honor Hotels.com Gold Member free early check in or free room upgrade program.
20,Hotel and room were nice enough. Centrally located right near everything.    The issue is with the ‚Äúresort fee‚Äù. I get that it‚Äôs a standard thing in Vegas however for $50 daily resort fee I received:  - Wi-Fi that worked occasionally and when it did it was slow  - Pool access for pools that were not open  - Gym that could not be found anywhere near our tower    Fee should be reduced when pools are not open.
40,Room was clean and updated with USB ports easy to find. Coffee maker was clean but you had to buy the pods which I find disappointing.    Rideshare area near the food court and is a decent walk from the hotel lobby. Overall we had a good experience.
30,Highly recommend Self check-in. Very fast and Easy. Room is clean which is great. I am disappointed in the fact that the picture shown on the website when I booked is not representative of the actual room. I booked a Palace Premium. In the picture it shows a large room with a king bed and a full siting area with a sectional couch an ottoman and a desk area. The room I received was much smaller in square footage and can only hold a single chair with a small side table. I was going to work a bit during the day and was counting on the extra space to spread out. So from that standpoint it very much feels like a bait and switch. If I had known the room was going to be this small I would have opted for the next size up. They should be more honest with their representations so that people can book the correct room.
30,We stayed 3 nights at Caesars in the Augustus tower and the room was very nice. We had a view of the Bellagio fountain along with the northern part of the strip. Everything was great until about 2am the first night when I started hearing water dripping in the bathroom. It started to get louder so I got up to investigate. I found water dripping from the ceiling over the tub. I called the front desk and they sent someone up. While waiting the new ‚Äúrain shower‚Äù started to spread as water was leaking from more parts of the ceiling and onto the bathroom floor. The maintenance person arrived and promptly went upstairs to stop the leak from the tub above. Shortly after that another person from the staff arrived to view the damage and asked if we wanted to change rooms. We weren‚Äôt bothered by it as long as it didn‚Äôt start leaking again so we opted to stay in that room. I say all that to say that through all of it no one from Caesars apologized for what was happening. It was ‚Äúdo you want to change rooms?‚Äù And that was it. No apology no free Starbucks or anything. I‚Äôm sure this rarely happens but it happened to us and all we really wanted was someone to say ‚Äúsorry this happened to you we know it‚Äôs not what you expect from a high dollar hotel on the strip‚Äù.
10,The hotel is under construction which no one tells you about when you make reservations or check in. Lines are really long for everything and they are completely short staffed. You cannot get into any restaurant without a reservation for dinner even party of 1 to sit at a bar and eat. Room service does not answer the phone. The mini bar in my room was left half full from the last guest with open half drank cans of redbull coke etc. I called down so that I would not be charged for this and they would clean it up. No one came to do so for the entire time I was there.    I was upcharged for everything checking in early (2pm) $75 checking out late (3pm) $90 a resort fee ($60/day) and they didnt even have pool ammenities because they were under construction internet $14.99/ day    For the cost of this hotel plus additional fees I would have expected much more.
10,This is the worst experience I have ever had at hotel. My stay was plagued with key issues. My hotel key stopped working the second night of my stay and on the final day of my stay I was locked out of my room for 3 hours. Yes my key stopped working twice and it was not demagnetized. You‚Äôd think that a simple trip to the front desk would resolve this issue but no. The front desk kept saying 20 minutes and security will assist you at your room. Apparently the lock on our door was malfunctioning. But security never came to our room I just had to sit outside of it. I had to walk all the way down to the front desk and beg for assistance or call the operator 5+ times and this went on for over 3 hours. All of the staff ‚Äúassisting‚Äù me were highly incompetent and unhelpful. They lied to my face. They did comp a late checkout and resort fees but the person staying with me had to call the hotel after we got home because they were not taken off our bill automatically.
10,"Saw Sting here in Saturday night. One machine in the lobby of the casino to pre-pay parking to get out of lot for 4000 people exiting the show all at once. Not a single facility employee within 300 yards of this machine except restaurant staff as I wanted to ask for directions to another such machine. As packed as this building was there should have been at least security around. Discovered one each on parking lot floors - the 4th floor machine was out of order and the ""call if you need assistance"" button had been pressed and ringing for the 15 minutes I waited in line. The 5th floor machine took my card but did not take the hotel scans of the three groups in front of me - they left angry having to pay the ridiculous $30 to park for three hours (was supposed to be free for them staying at hotel). THEN 45 minutes to get out of the garage. Come on people you've been doing this EVERY night for decades figure this out! Prior night's experience at the Westgate was complete opposite - free parking many lot exits soooo many staff around to give directions. Hope to never set foot on Ceasar's property again."
40,My husband and I had to cancel two Vegas trips in 2020 due to Covid. We finally made it for his birthday and decided to stay Nov 8-12 at Caesars for a more central location (we normally stay at the Venetian). As the trip neared we got really nervous reading all the poor reviews. However I am happy to report that we had an excellent stay and would gladly stay at Caesars again in the future.    We arrived just before 6:30pm on Monday and check in only took 14 minutes. There were about 10 people in front of us in line and 5 front desk staff. We stayed in a Palace Premium Studio room overlooking the pools which was lovely. We really loved having separate his and hers bathrooms. The bathtub was the deepest I have ever seen and the jets made for an awesome bubble bath. It was the perfect way to relax after walking 10+ miles a day!    Housekeeping did not make it to our room on Tuesday which was no big deal. We had read that might happen and tried to anticipate when we might run out of towels. On Wednesday morning around 5am I submitted an online request for extra towels and was shocked at how quickly they were dropped off outside our door (less than 30 minutes). Housekeeping was provided both Wednesday and Thursday (we checked out early Friday).    We ate a quick breakfast at Pronto by Giada one morning and were satisfied. The oatmeal was delicious and decaf coffee had good flavor. We also grabbed dinner from the Halal Guys in the food court and took it back to our room one night. Large portions were more than enough. We also brought k cups from home to use the in room Keurig.    After reading all the negative reviews we were prepared for a few issues but honestly we were more than satisfied with our stay. Check in was fine the room was clean and comfortable housekeeping was provided all days but one and towels were delivered almost immediately when requested on site food was good location was excellent. The only two complaints we read that rang true for us were that the WiFi is a bit weak and the walk to the taxi stand when leaving the property is a bit winding and far.    Don‚Äôt be afraid of staying at Caesars! We had a wonderful trip and plan to return. The Palace Premium Studio room is on par with rooms at the Venetian in terms of size and quality (two bathrooms actually make it better). The property is lively and large with lots of food and gambling options. The central location cannot be beat as it was very easy to walk to the Cromwell Bellagio Cosmopolitan Paris and other casinos. Thank you Caesars for a great return trip to Vegas! We will be back!!
30,Valet sent me and my family of 5 children to park at Bally‚Äôs for oversized vehicles which was fine. They said Bally‚Äôs would shuttle us back. Not true - we had an incredibly stressful 30 min walk with 5 little kids and ALL our luggage. Couldn‚Äôt reach any staff.
30,The facility is tired staff were brusque. The wi-fi was weak and the prices were outrageous. Avoid the buffet ($81?!). Bring your own K cups for the coffee maker to avoid a $21 dollar bill. A not-good daiquiri at the pool is $30!    The Amalfi restaurant was fantastic‚Äîone of the best meals I‚Äôve ever had with a great waiter as amazing food.    Absinthe was great!    Sting was awesome!
10,This is the worst hotel I've ever stayed at in Vegas and one of the worst ever. Dingy smelly overpriced mediocre food and slots that never pay off even enough to keep you interested in playing. The room TV and WiFi rarely worked and forget about calling the front desk without being on hold less than 15 minutes. They also added a charge to our bill at check out that wasn't ours so double check your total when you check out.    We only stayed there because we went to see Sting (who was great and so is Caesar's concert venue!).    Caesar's is living off their reputation do not waste your money!
10,I am very unhappy with my stay. the following happened  1. I was told i could download an app which then would allow me to check in early and avoid a 75.00 charge after 2 hours of dealing back and forth with the front desk person i ended up paying the 75.00 even though now my wife and i have the Caesars app which we can now place sporting bets on. (got screwed and wasted 2 hours)  2 my room was disappointing Shower wand loose and falling off the wall all shower wall tile cracked carpet stains near the coffee table area coffee table missing a chunk off the top. TV kept turning off phone hand set not charging.  3. my room was not serviced and i had to ask for new towels which were promptly delivered.  4 i was charged for an late check out which i didn't need or use i manually checked out at 10:59 in the lobby.  5. i was never asked to upgrade my room which might have been more acceptable.    Over all the experience was terrible the front desk person was of no help. When i did call down to the front desk i was placed on hold
20,I have been coming to caesars annually for 20 years. This will be my last trip. Premium price for poor service. Pool closed and one manager said out of season and another manager said staff shortage. Neighboring pools open. Room not clean when checked in. Long line to check in and out. Express check in not available which was comical. Under construction so noisy and inconvenient for rides. Long lines for expensive coffee and food. In room options limited and all expensive. Moving on.
10,We have stayed in a lot of casinos. This is by far the worst. Checkin took nearly one hour. Our bathroom smelled like stale cigarette smoke. The lamp and clock were unplugged behind the nightstand and it took us a little while to figure out why nothing worked. A box of four coffee pods $2168 each! A box of peanut m&m‚Äôs $13. A bag of nuts over $17.00! Buffet $81 per person and we were 143 in wait line (did not eat there) chicken sandwich fries and bottled water $30 and not edible! Breakfast for two at Cafe Americano $88. Place is huge confusing to get around tight machines and the nicest staff member was the maid. Management and staff could not care less if you have a medical emergency or not‚Ä¶just plain rude. I would not recommend this place at all.    We uber‚Äôd over to Golden Nugget and had a blast.    This was an anniversary trip we‚Äôd like to forget. Thanks Caesars.
50,First time visitor to this property. Self parking was easy to maneuver check in was a little slow but not frustrating and the room was very clean and comfortable. Like all casinos it‚Äôs a maze to get around but overall our experience was fine. My only complaints would be the smoking in the casino the resort fee and the minimum bets on the tables (25 dollars). We found cheaper alternatives to the table minimum at other casinos nearby. The sports book employee was very helpful and pleasant. Overall we enjoyed our first time there even though we moved some of our gambling to other establishments. Check out was easy.
10,"Stayed at Caesars in Las Vegas November 5 - 10 2021. Asked for a room without a connecting door due to noise - even paid for an upgrade. When I got to the room it of course was a room with a connecting door. Upon check-in I was asked if I wanted make-up service each day and I stated Yes. Other than the first day even though I had the Make Up Room button pushed no maid service was provided for the next four days. I had to call down for fresh towels each night. I heard other people at the conference had the same issue. Everything must be being handled off-site. Try to call the front desk and if you get through they put you on hold and then cut you off. Happened three times. When you do get someone it's someone who's first language was not English. could not use the check out on the TV as it ""could not access at this time"". Tried to call for a late check out the day before and they could not even tell me the fee until later that night. They were under some construction and for some reason the Cab Stand was almost two blocks away from the lobby so everytime you wanted to go somewhere which required a cab or at check out it was a 1/4 mile trip to the cab stand. I will never stay at this hotel again! Was there a couple of years ago without any problems. I understand it has recently sold and it has certainly gone downhill. Stay Away!"
30,very big hotel be ready to walk np less than 10 000 step day by day )))  because destinations inside is very far also to go out you have to pass many big rooms on first floor where a lot of people in casino and there are very loud of course. to get uber you have to go over all hotel uber stop on the other back side of the hotel.  rooms are comfortable clean.  minibar is very expensive even 1 small bottle of water 9 usd
10,They have a lot of nerve charging you a resort fee. The pool is closed. You have to walk a mile on a serpentine course to almost all the way out to Las Vegas Blvd. to get a cab. And worst of all they don't give a darn about the mask mandate. We stayed at the Palazzo before we went to the Grand Canyon and at Caesars after we went. If you walk around the Venetian or the Palazzo almost every single person is masked. About half the people at Caesars are unmasked jerks who don't care if they get you sick and make you die. Caesars does nothing about this. There is smoking in their sports book but not at the one at the Venetian.    Stay at the Venetian.
30,Flew into Vegas for to see Sting at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace so staying there seemed like the logical choice. I paid for a room with a fountain view. My room did not have a fountain room. We were checking in needed to get dinner and get to the show. I didn't feel that we had time to deal with getting a room change so I stuck with the room without a view. The room had a coffee maker but the pods to make coffee were not included in the $375+ room. Really you can't provide 2 cups of coffee for that price? There was the customary foods (which included the coffee) for purchase but no price list. We all know nothing is reasonably priced on those things so we had to leave the room for coffee. We wanted to leave our bags while we killed a few hours before our flight out. The bell cap is no where near the front desk. With unclear directions we found the bell cap. We had a shuttle arranged for our trip back to to the airport...unclear directions from the bell cap and no signage to indicate the area for pick up. Luckily someone who was also using the shuttle confirmed that we were actually in the right place. The Sting show was great. I highly recommend it. Stay somewhere else.
10,We really could sue Caesars but probably too much trouble. Our grandson was in the pool and cut his foot on a pool light that was broken. It was a bad cut. We first called the front desk and asked if there was first aid. They were very unaccommodating and just said that we should go to a medical facility nearby. We told them there was a broken light in the pool but they couldn‚Äôt have cared. Finally a security man came over but didn‚Äôt take a report snd no one came to fix it. The concern was nonexistent. Our grandson had to have stitches due to negligence on Caesars part. Also we were charged $17 for pulling out an item in the minibar and putting it back. There‚Äôs a Keurig machine in the room but the coffee is $20 for 4 Keurig cups. Check in is at 4:00 but you can‚Äôt get your room early even if it‚Äôs ready unless you pay $75. The attitude is lousy and no customer service. For $300+ a night I‚Äôd expect a little more. Lines for the front desk are ridiculously long. The hotel is under construction so if you arrive in an Uber you have a long walk to the entrance. The rooms are nice but We will never stay at Caesars again.
20,We enjoyed the hotel but after placing our dinner leftovers in the fridge we incurred a $75 charge! That is absolutely ridiculous. We used NONE of the mini bar stock and everything is back in it's place. They refused to refund us. We will not return to Caesars.
20,Both rooms had stained carpets. Even on the 14th floor the venue located outside ‚ÄúAbsinthe‚Äù was very loud until 3:00 AM! Charged me for a can of pringles even though I told them I hadn‚Äôt touched them! Don‚Äôt eat at Cafe Americano! Terrible service and mediocre food.
20,"This place is overcrowded and the staff seem strung out. There are not enough restaurants open for the number of people staying at the hotel. It took us 90 minutes in line to get seated for breakfast and by then the breakfast menu had ended and we ended up with lunch!    In addition to the ubiquitous lines for everything from hotel registration to valet parking to Starbucks I was disappointed to see parallel lines for the Caesars loyalty club members. While we waited in line for restaurants there was another line next to us for ""Diamond Club"" members who got to cut in front of us plebes. I understand that loyal customers should be rewarded but the blatant way that Caesars does it made us feel that the $500/night we spent to stay at the hotel was worth nothing to them.    On the positive side the hotel room was well appointed large and clean with excellent bathroom fixtures. Here again we were faced with a disappointment. The Keurig machine in the room instead of being an amenity to show appreciation to the customer required a purchase of the coffee pods from the minibar (~$15)"
30,Great location and Nice decor... pricey rooms our view of the Pool areas were greeted by filthy windows Bathroom had very poor shower pressure and kind of surprised that they didn't offer complimentary coffee in the room...
30,"Hotel is in a convenient location. Rooms are nice. In November of 2021 they are seriously understaffed (probably all hotels are facing the same problem). We arrived 20 minutes before check-in time (after a 20 minute wait in the queue to check in). The agent told us that an early check in (20 minutes?) would cost an additional fee. A cash tip took care of that but wasn't needed because by the time we were checked in (5 rooms) it was 30 minutes after check in time. Turns out that first attempt to take more money out of our wallets was just the start of things. Two coffees in a downstairs restaurant was $17. Breakfast for two at Giadi was $50. Use of the mini-fridge in the room (provided for guest convenience) would have been an additional $70. Two drinks at the pool was $60. I'm surprised there wasn't a credit card reader in the elevator that charged each time you rode the lift. The hotel casino is undergoing some kind of renovation and walls have been constructed blocking off portions of the casino that funneled everyone into very narrow walkways. We're spoiled we usually stay at the Wynn but had decided to stay ""center strip"" for a change. We'll head back to north strip next trip."
10,The only good think about Caesars is the newly renovated bathroom and the location. The hotel towels need to be BURNED. They were all stained dingy and dirty. The furniture had markings and carving on it and the bedding had holes in it. This hotel is gross. I would never stay here again. It also smells horrible. I had to buy air freshener since they seem to not clean with scented products or use air freshener or laundry detergent and bleach.
30,This Hotel property I had given my complete faith in until recently. As they say nothing is forever. Being a platinum member I must say things have changed dramatically to a point that it may be time to seek out other properties. Every year I accumulate hundreds of dollars in rewards by visiting the property & using my Ceasars rewards Visa card but this year (of course bad cust is blamed on Covid) yeah ok..... trying to redeem my points for services or during checkout involved almost a full days stay. My Ceasars V.I.P card apparently does not get me front of the line priority anymore anywhere??? I was told it was not honored anymore due to covid Guess the hotel lost to much money & now is trying to recoup it somehow. Overall staff not attentive to customer needs anymore you need to argue about almost everything you touch.can't get proper amenities for your room all the way down to cheap T/P in the bathrooms. No more VIP service unless your a seven seas card holder if thats all the hotel wants there thats what there going to get soon.
30,Stay was pretty good other than the fact that the main entrance is closed and they only allow ride sharing pick ups from so every time we were picked up or dropped off we had to walk from one end to the other end of the hotel and casino (10+ mins). Weren‚Äôt made aware of this so it was a total surprise and annoying.
10,Check In took forever. Traveled with husband that had a stroke 3 years ago and chose Ceasars for our 20 year anniversary! When checking in line he was getting tired and when I asked for a chair lady just told me to go and sit in the bar and come back later. When I pointed out he is disabled she didn‚Äôt care. Bathroom was accesible but horrible design. Water drain is in the middle of bathroom floor and no way to have floor dry after shower! If you want to check in before 4 pm there is a 75$ fee. They didn‚Äôt not offer anything for our anniversary and when asked for an update they said would cost 150$ more a night. Room was not dated and Julius tower was not new. Horrible view . Oh and pool is not heated. My husband could not even walk without bumping chairs of how crowded it was. Do not stay In This hotel if you have a disability. They won‚Äôt care. Husband fell of a chair as they swivel on the casino floor and nobody came to help even though 2 security saw what happened. Will not stay here ever! Other casinos have chairs with arms that are more stable!
30,No one could be checked in until 4 p.m. so the lines were incredibly long and they didn't have enough staff to handle the crowd. As soon as we got the room we changed to go to the pool. It closed early - lack of staff. Getting around in the place is difficult. I thought I could rely on the Caesar's app but it mostly timed out and didn't work. There are no signs telling you where the gym is and if you put in gym in the Caesar's app it actually sends you to other hotels! One day there was no one to clean the room. When we check out there were charges on the bill that shouldn't have been there...coffee in the room and internet. They did remove the charges but it took standing in a long line. It took around 40 minutes to get a cup of coffee in the morning. A lot of construction is going on just right outside of the facility. The rooms were clean when we checked in and the location is good for being on the strip. I wouldn't go back.
20,Very disappointing 1st time Vegas visit. The room and furniture were very outdated. The doors and drawers on the furniture were actually falling apart. Very poor lighting and the shower leaked water all over the place. No refrigerator or microwave not even complimentary coffee. We rented this hotel based on previous 4.5 rating. The only good thing was a comfortable bed. For the money we paid we were expecting at least a well maintained room. The restaurants within the hotel were either closed most of the day or overcrowded. Room service would raise the Ac thermostat setting causing the room to get hot during the day.
20,Disappointed with customer service started from check in. The front desk was rude and unprofessional. Had to deal with manager as well  who was not professional and super rude. The room was so outdated and furniture was scratched. Non-smoking room smelled as smoking. It's time to renovate that hotel and change or upgrade the stuff.
30,This is a ‚Äújust fine‚Äù property but I won‚Äôt be staying here ever again. I want something more upscale for the price especially if it‚Äôs for pleasure.    I downgraded for the following reasons most of which are about lack of convenience in a location where I want convenience.    1. Resort fee only ($51/day) allows for only two concurrent internet connections. Otherwise and additional $14/device. This is a nickel and dime property. The resort fee is a scam.    2. No room service. You can‚Äôt call down and get breakfast or anything delivered. You have to use a lame Caesar Eats type app where you have food delivered from specific restaurants. The service phone line won‚Äôt even help. Just straight up said they didn‚Äôt have a central kitchen or room service anymore and that we have to use the app. Well they have full room service at Wynn Venetian and Cosmo - because people want that when they come to Vegas.    3. Room is straight up 4-star generic chain quality. Beat up furniture. Water damage on the bathroom ceiling. And this was one of the ‚Äúrenovated‚Äù rooms with a view in Augustus Tower. If this is renovated what do the others look like? Also housekeeping missed us one day.    4. Construction. Lobby is walled off. Noise up front and even when I was in the spa. Seriously a saw that you can hear in the spa?    5. Pickup and drop off are complicated. Because of construction the cab stand (departing) is very far walk out the lobby by some fountains around construction and into a small makeshift parking lot.    5. A homeless man jumped into the lobby fountain while I was having drinks and breakfast with friends. He was splashing around and stuffing coins into his pocket. Security staff front desk staff and bar staff did nothing. The janitors just cleaned up his mess after he ran off. Really?    6. Too much mask/no-mask here. Caesar‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt enforcing the masks signs they had installed so it led to conflict between those ignoring the signs and those adhering to them. The signs all over Caesars say ‚Äúwear a mask‚Äù so we did. On several occasions guests showed bravado around not wearing masks. People without masks started getting brazen with those wearing mask. Lots of unwanted political commentary from unmasked guests to masked guests at tables elevators pool restaurants. I don‚Äôt care about the masks I just want less unnecessary conflict/commentary between strangers. Actual enforcement or removing the signs would help with this.
30,This is usually my favorite place to stay. Unfortunately this time.... I found a used condom in my bed when I pulled the sheets back on my first night. Good times! Their pillows were horrible this time as well. Lumpy. No coffee included anymore. Have to pay for the packs in the room.
20,There is no such thing as customer service. You have to pay $75 to get into the room earlier than 4pm which you can eventually waive via an app. A room was available at noon but I was asked if I was willing to pay $75...really? Totally unheard of. The room did not have any reception and they could not arrange a room switch either. Worse no one even bothered to follow up. NOT RECOMMENDED - plenty of other better hotels on the strip.
10,Dirty floors dust everywhere. Light bulbs out in bathroom clogged sink safe did not work. Called abt 4 times and had to go to the hotel lobby for help after hours of calling and waiting for help. Manager aware of situation and did nothing to fix. The worst hotel stay and management I‚Äôve ever experienced. And sadly it was my granddaughters first trip there to experience this was just horrible !!!
50,We stayed at Caesers Oct21-24 and we absolutely loved it! We stayed in the Augustus tower and we had a beautiful view of the fountains. Our room was super clean and the staff was amazing! The bed was so comfortable that I wish I had looked at the mattress and found the manufacture so I could purchase one for my bedroom!
50,Was very impressed with the service during our two day stay. Very helpful and polite. Room was spacious clean and comfortable. Enjoyed the casino atmosphere. Everyone was relaxed and liked the numerous tables and slots to choose from. In the center of the strip made everything else within walking distance. Thank you for a memorable experience!
10,Horrible no coffee pot in room no refrigerator .  They charged you resort fee. If the Room is ready early they make you wait till 3Pm if u want to check in early they charged you extra. Thundervalley never do that thunder valley have coffe and refrigerator in every room.
30,When you pay for a nice motel the basics should be included‚Ä¶such as small fridge & microwave. Daily resort fee $51. Too high and the convenience stores/food places were at least triple the normal price. We felt like we were being gouged.
20,The good: The check in was easy food was good and location was perfect. Also the maid was super polite and did a great job. But that's where the good ends.    The Bad: The bed/pillows were horrible. The worst sleep I've ever had on a vacation.The lack of being able to use the fridge was horrible. The WiFi was horrible. There was little to no water pressure but at least the water temp was good. After staying here for 6 nights I would never recommend it to anyone else.
10,We are staying Monday night through Friday night Tuesday which is today was supposed to be a nice surprise for my wife and I had booked a very nice suite just for one night. I was told at checkin for our room for the week the suite would be ready by 11 am the next day. Go stand in line at 12 and was told it wasn‚Äôt ready understandable was told that the other party had moved out they just needed to clean it and he would expedite I asked if he had any idea and he explained he did not but that they would send a text as soon as possible I spent the whole day waiting on a text that never made it. 5pm I show up and they said the room is still not ready and if the room was not ready by 6pm they would give me comps I am standing by check in 5:45 waiting 5:53 I receive a text saying room is ready within a few seconds Greet the manager who tells me I can not get the room yet due to an outage across Nevada they send that text so they didn‚Äôt have to comp anything when I asked if they would transfer the booking for the next day she looked and it was available the manager said no but acted like he did me a favor by refunded my money. I got back to my room and called customer service front desk and was hung up on. This has been the worst experience I have ever had in my years of coming to Vegas. Things happen and are understandable just make it right.
10,My husband and I traveled to Las Vegas 10/28-11/1 we had a quite disappointing experience at Caesers Palace. My husband stayed in February and since then it has gone steadily downhill. After waiting 30 mintues to check in at 1:30 I was told there would be a $40 charge for early check-in. Then after the front desk person spoke to the manager I wasn't allowed to check-in. My husband was on a conference call and had gone to the conference center to take the call. The reservation was in his name so even with the confiramation number the exact credit card the reservation had been made on and my ID I couldn't check in. I was told he could add me to the then I could check in. I tracked him down and he added me to the reservation. (by the way I was the one who made the original reservation) I tried the express check in because I had been added to reservation. The machine denied my reservation. I again waited 30 minutes to check in and was told by the manager who was quite rude Ms. McMann I believe that my husband must be present to check in. I originally was told I could check in if my husband added me to the reservation. I felt like a second class citizen. When he finished his call we used the express check in and were charged a $45 early check in fee to check in at 3pm. The resort fee is $51.02 per day and I'm not sure really what that includes to use the pool? There was a keurig coffee pot in the room but $28 to use the Kcups in the minibar. The prices charged for food and drinks is ridiculous I can't believe Caesers can't supply a few cups of coffee and some decent toiletries. Room was showing some age and a strong Weed smell throughout. With so many other choices along the strip we won't be returning. The hotel doesn't enforce Covid protocols lots of people with no masks. We dined at some exceptional places like Majordomo at the Vinetian and Picasso at the Bellagio these places were wonderful.
10,I just checked in after a long flight at 1:30 am - had to wait over 30 minutes as the express checkin machines were not working. They told me checkout is 11:30 --- I asked for 2 as I have a 430 flight out they said NO unless I wanted to pay more - I asked for manager who was not very pleasant and said too many people checking in that day - so I said $40 would make a difference? He said see a pit boss and if u play maybe they will take care of it. He shrugged and left. I have to be inconvenienced with all the construction which I wasnt told about and they cant give me 2 hours???    My room looks like it should have been rennovated years ago - I cant believe I came here - wanted to give it a shot --- never never again
10,"This hotel has come down hill bad. We're staying in a suite. It's gross!! It's old old old. Caesar's charges for EVERYTHING!! They don't even offer complimentary coffee in the room. I called and was told to use the mini bar. $21 for 4 coffee pods. $75 to just open the fridge. There are no robes and slippers as one would expect in a luxury suite at $500 per night. Run!! Run far away!!! Stay somewhere else!! It's that bad. Oh and wifi is only free on the first two devices!! This is so substandard. If I weren't here on business I'd check out.    UPDATE: 1 day later. I got lost and I hurt my knee. Barely able to walk I limped up to counter. There were a few people in line about 50 feet down the way at the registration counter. I approached the nearest person behind the desk. The man(employee) literally raised his voice over my asking and said ""I'm helping another customer!!"" The customer was still at least 50 feet away. Now bear in mind he'd saw me approaching and deliberately signaled the other customer who was slowing walking towards us. I tried continued ""please just point."" I begged ""I'm lost! I'm hurt! Please just point?"" He got louder and talking over me ""I'm helping another customer! I'm helping another customer!"" He kept getting louder and louder repeating himself! I wasn't even speaking at that point but just standing there in shock at this unkind cruel person. He wouldn't let me speak. Now the customer finally arrives. He literally puts his hand up in a stop signal at this employee who's still repeating himself. He was kind and saw that I was hurt. He tried to direct me but didn't know where to send me so. He asked the man behind the counter. He refused to tell him either and I had to limp to the line 50 feet away only to have another employee simply point me in the direction to my room. When I told my husband what happened he went straight down to the manager who just blew him off"
40,My wife and I went Oct 25th to Oct 29. 4 nights of gambling - eating - drinking. Check-in went well to a point. We were advised we were on the PET FRIENDLY FLOOR....WHAT!!! We had no pets with us and barking dogs all night is a NIGHTMARE. The agent was able to find us another room in the Augustus Tower but it was going to be a few hours. We checked the bags and went to the slots. A few hours later it was ready and fine. We were fairly high up but still heard dogs barking in some rooms as we walked down the hall. Keep in mind that Caesars is THE hotel to stay at if you have small children or barking dogs with you. If you have both then you're a WINNER!!! Also the smell of SKUNK WEED was prominent throughout the hotel so smoking weed here is A-OK!!! We ate all 4 dinners at Caesars: Rao's NOBU Mr. Chow Amalfi. I'll write seperate reviews on each but suffice it to say that all (except Amalfi) were EXCELLENT! My wife got her haircut at the Salon and she said ANNIE was AWESOME!!! As always keep your expectations low here and they'll always be met.
10,The worst hotel experience of my life. Rude staff and will only help if you agree to pay more money. Very long wait to check in unless you pay extra. Motel 6 will treat you better. Very disappointed with this experience. No manager available but it seems like part of the scam. Never again.
20,Caesars Palace has been our favorite place to stay and play in Las Vegas for years.    Tonight Friday night. All kinds of people not wearing masks and no consequence whatsoever. I'm vaccinated and having to wear my freaking mask because of these dumb f*cks that don't want to get vaccinated! It's getting so old...    Caesars Palace if you're requiring your visitors to wear masks enforce it! Saw a guy without a mask go up to a security guard and ask a question and the security guard didn't enforce your policy. Saw an entire wedding party walking around without masks and this was just a drop in the bucket of the non-mask wearing I witnessed. Unacceptable!    Until COVID is under control we're not returning. Either make mask use not necessary or enforce it for all!
20,This seasoned visitor to Vegas was surprisingly disappointed with our stay at Caesar‚Äôs Palace. We have stayed at both budget & luxury properties over the years. This is my second stay at Caesars. The nature of this trip was business we had a few employees along with us. 4 rooms in total were booked for a 4 day/ 3 night stay.    The different members of our party did check in at separate times. One of our parties were LIED to by the attendant checking them in. If I had his name I would list it. The attendant was trying to ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù our guest for $35 (which is fine) but our party declined the offer. Then the attendant lied & said all other rooms are in the same tower & for our guest to be in the same tower they need to upgrade. The attendant then started to search the system said he found a upgrade no charge with a great view in the same tower as all other guests as long as they didn‚Äôt mind the room number 666. Our guests were not superstitious didn‚Äôt mind & agreed. Little did they know their room was downgraded in comparison the rest of our parties room‚Äôs. Our guest‚Äôs had a pool view originally now they looked at AC units on the roof below & exhaust events. Additionally ALL 4 of our rooms were each in separate towers.    So my own check in. Jocelyn check us into our room. Normally the interaction with reps at check-in are friendly happy to assist & trying to give great customer service. This was not the case. Our experience was cold short & borderline rude. Once we arrived to our room unpacked our belongings I started to notice a Smokey odor. It wasn‚Äôt strong but slightly noticeable. Ehh no big we went about our business decided to head out for a couple of hours. Once we returned to the room it reeked of Smokey BBQ!!! I literally searched the room for leftovers! I called to the front desk & again was met with an indifferent kinda rude attitude. I asked if we were near any resturants etc. & asked the possibility of switching rooms the hotel was at capacity but check back tomorrow. The rep wasn‚Äôt really helpful & kinda had the attitude of welp what do you want to do about it? They offered to deodorize the room. It was late husband was already in bed so opted to wait & see if it would get better.  The following morning still very Smokey. Husband had to attend his work conference. I left & we both came back mid-morning. Yet again overwhelming BBQ smell & now some of my clothes are starting to have a Smokey odor. Called the desk a second time. No rooms to switch too ok fine I totally understand but there was no sense of urgency to assist no sense of customer service as in what can we do to help?! Nothing. I did ask for maintenance to come to duck tape the window vents shut & asked to have the room deodorized that day.  I will say maintenance came with 20-30 minutes. The individual was AWESOME I wish I knew her name. I did ask her to take a big breath & smell the room however she said she doesn‚Äôt have a sense of smell due to a medical reason. She did duck tape the vents shut changed our AC filter and she did state that if hotel wasn‚Äôt at capacity she would have us moved. Great customer service. After the deodorization & vent closure the room tolerable but the smell never dissipated totally.    Qua spa: I booked a treatment online the amenities listed unavailable. So I not plan to be able to use the amenities of the spa. My massage was great AnneMarie was my therapist she did a great job! I felt comfortable during my session she has great technique and I recommend her services.    My experience with the spa that was disappointing was the fact that I was under the impression the additional facilities were closed and my day did not allow the extra time to enjoy them. I did ask if it was possible to return the following day to partake in the amenities I missed out on & was declined.    Over all my disappointment steams from the lack of CUSTOMER SERVICE. It‚Äôs dead at Caesars so don‚Äôt expect it. That or we were just not ‚Äúhigh roller‚Äù enough to matter.
40,Room was nice great size good view the shower is hanging off in bathroom of room 2780 top of headboard really dusty... I expected it to be perfect with how much it cost... I won't stay again only because it's just way to big and so much walking to get food/drink etc Front desk we're really friendly good AC in bedroom no food included
20,We stay here every year for a conference. It‚Äôs really gone downhill. The front lobby/ entrance is under construction and the signage to get to the back of the building and ‚Äúlobby‚Äù is ridiculously poor. Valet parking is now 25$ a day and the resort fee is over $50 a day. What does the resort fee get you? Wifi for 2 devices and use of fitness center. ( who wants to go to their gym- you have to wear a mask!?)  The wifi was very slow. Fitness center is actually nice- except for mask part.  We had to call the front desk several times. First the bathroom lights didn‚Äôt work. Next the tv didn‚Äôt work. Engineering had to come and fix. 2 separate phone calls. House keeping didn‚Äôt come the next day and we didn‚Äôt get towels or clean glasses.  Many of the food and retail stores have limited hours and may even be closed. The lines for food were long poor service and expensive!  Bottom line- the ongoing covid ripple effect has taken its toll on yet another business.  They don‚Äôt have enough people working at the resort. Those who are working are carrying all the weight and tired.  I think there should be some policy that we don‚Äôt play unemployment benefits when the available jobs far exceed those sitting at home. Just sayin‚Äô
10,Check in Isn‚Äôt until 4:00 PM. Receptionist wanted $40 extra to check in early. Interesting walking to a different receptionist he wanted $75. Management just said it fairies according to how busy we are even though it was at the same time. They said I could store my bags while I waited but that would‚Äôve been at least a 15 minute walk. I had to present for a conference and needed to shower and get changed by 5. They really did not care.
40,I recently attended a conference at Ceasar's Palace. So I stayed here as well to make the commute from my room to the conference center eaiser. I quickly learned that staying on property really didn't help too much. I know the property itself if massive. But getting to the conference hall can be a challenge. I guess it was better than having to cross the street from Harrah's to get here. But no matter which tower you stay at on site you will have a trek to the conference center. Which itself is massive. You can very easily get lost anywhere on this property. It isn't just the shops or the hotel itself. It is so large it is easy to get turned around. I have been many times and still get turned around. The rooms were nice. But for the price my rooms at Harrah's was just as comfortable if not better. There were so many choices of food options that if you didn't want to leave resort you didn't have to. Although my one take away was the lack of early breakfast options. Eespecially since they hold several conferences during most weeks you would expect them to have more options. Most days the line at Starbuck's was at least a 1/2 an hours wait. So I opted for the crepe's place next door. Good REGULAR coffee for 1/2 the cost. And more breakfast options. I ate breakfast and got a coffe for what the people at Starbuck's paid for a coffee. But it is hidden just next to Starbucks and most people don't know it is there. A little more advertising or pointing of the way for the crepes people would improve their business alot. And they are soooo nice there. There is a so called breakfast spot on the way to the conference center. Two days in a row I tried to eat there. It was Giada's place. (The wine bar I think. But they open for breakfast supposedly.) Again with confreneces going on you would think they would be open for breakfast. Day 1 they had a sign up that said they would open at 8:30am. Of course we all had to be in class by 8:30am. So headed back to crepe place. Their hours for day 2 was suppsed to be 7 or 7:30 am (earlier than the day before). I again headed over. They were there but said they wouldn't be opening until 8am. So back to crepe place again. Because it is the only thing other than Starbucks that was open and had breakfast items. Overall the stay was good. The staff friendly when spoken to. No one ever went out of their way to speak to guest. But they were friendly when they were spoken to. Rooms and hotel clean and comfortable. Was it worth the price? Not in my book. Are there plenty of options? Yes depending on the time of day. Would I stay there again? If it were for conference purposes maybe. Otherwise probably not. I would probably go back to my room at Harrah's.
50,Not even one bad review or word‚Ä¶ this guys know exactly what they are doing and they are doing it good! If you want to have the Vegas Strip vibe this is your hotel to stay‚Ä¶ Highly recommended!! Best Bellagio view
30,We have stayed at Ceasars Palace prior and had a good experience so we decided to stay again. Worst decision. When we checked in we found underwear and bag of candy from previous guest left in 2 separate drawers. When we called to complain to the front desk they said they would send someone up and they never showed. The 2nd day housekeeping never showed up to clean our room even though we left light request on for service.    Worst hotel stay we have had in quite some time.
50,The pool and spa are fantastic here. Overall vibe and ambiance are great. It's always busy which is nice. I like the Sportsbook. It's worth it if you're wondering why it's a little pricier than you'd think it'd be. Only a small few hotels in Vegas are nicer. One visit I got upgraded to a suite because I told the clerk I got a speeding ticket on my drive there from Los Angeles--which was true by the way. Thumbs up. The gladiators live to fight another day.
20,The pools are not heated contrary to a couple of unofficial websites that I read. I should have known better. Caesar's website doesn't explicitly say that the pools are heated so I assume that they quit heating them. To make things worse the pool's food menu is very minimal. There is no hot food--only cold salads and sandwiches. And I rented a daybed and could feel the metal bars through the mattress. If you're looking for a good autumn/spring pool experience then go somewhere else. I doubt that I will return.
20,After 2 years of being stuck because of the pandemic; my fianc√© and I visited your hotel. Very underwhelming and not worth the hype. $20 for coffee k-cups in room?? Crazy. View from room was of other tower?!? We saved for a nice trip and were very let down. Shame on you. I guess only high rollers get decent treatment.
20,Caesar‚Äôs is overrated. The check in line was ridiculously long. Since check in was 4 pm and I arrived early I had to leave my luggage at the bell desk at the opposite end of the hotel.    The furniture in my room was chipped and outdated ‚Äî not the caliber that I was expecting. I had to request from maintenance that one table lamp be replaced because it had a shortage in it and wouldn't work properly. The floor lamp was missing bulbs which had to be replaced.    There was a Keurig but the pods were not complimentary. They had to be purchased.    The bathroom area was large but didn‚Äôt have a television or powder area.    I was limited to 2 devices on wi-fi per day so I could only have my cell phone and laptop but not my tablet.    I slept very well though. The bed was like a cloud. My view of the pool area was beautiful. The staff was nice.    In comparison to other properties in Vegas that I have stayed at before I can say that this is not the worst but it did not meet my expectations.
40,very enjoyable trip but I can see that they dont have enough employees. For the first time the bar video poker machines were dirty with most machines having sticking buttons. The bartender was extremely busy and did not have any time to wipe machines down. This is not the Caesars that I know. Also hard to get in to restaurants as they need more employes also.Food at Amalfi was excellent with no waiting. They had a lot of employees. Still a nice place to go in Vegas
20,Was given an unclean room had to go all the way back to the front desk and spend another half hour finding another room - No compensation at all for this. Asked four different staff members where the fitness center was - all of them not sure and did nothing to find out where. There was construction on the front of the property and again had issues finding where I could leave my bag for a few hours after I checked out.
20,It has been a few years since I have been here so maybe my experience is not all that odd. Over 100 people in front of me at check in. Took over 90 minutes. Room was ok but very dated and weathered. Shower was awesome - always important but other than that kind of disappointing. I did not use the mini bar but opened that cabinet door to it and it almost fell off the hinges. My room was not made up either day - not a big issue because it was just me but all the same that's part of the deal. The hotel/casino level is difficult to navigate by design and it makes it a challenge to get anywhere. When I went to self checkout I was given options up till 1 pm to checkout and chose 1 pm. My confirmation said 11 am. Called front desk and they said 11 am was correct even though I chose the options. Then was advised that I could extend to 1 pm for another $51. All in all not in a hurry to come back to Caesars.
10,I booked an Octavius Pool Room for the 21st-26th. Upon approach to our elevator the hallways smelled of spoiled fish and meat (near the buffet which we had reservations too but decided not to eat there). Entering the room at first glance seemed fine. But after actually settling in. We found used floss picks laying on the floor. Hairs in the tub. And none of the phones worked. At this point we were unhappy. But as I proceeded to make drinks with ice from the 61st floors ice machine. I saw foreign contamination frozen inside one of my ice cubes. We were disgusted to the point of gagging at this point. As we leave the room to speak with the hotel clerks. We're yet again blown away when confronted by 5 armed guards and a hotel manager in the midst of domestic violence dispute with another room... After letting the front desks know all of this. We were told we'd have to be in the room and waiting for our phones to be replaced. But housekeeping would clean the room again an they would also send maintenance to check the ice machine. Once we got back a replacement TV remote was hanging on our door handle. And the sheets were changed. Floss hair and grime previously mentioned still sitting in the same spots. By this point it's late we're exhausted and need to sleep. The following day I let the room staff know myself when I saw them in the hallway. Still nothing but a bed change. On our final night I yet again bring all of these previous encounters up to the desk clerk. At this point I'm offered an hour extension on my check out time and a day of resort fees comped... I always book at a ceasers property when in vegas. But after this experience. I will be looking into other stays.
50,First....c'mon people. I read these review where everyone wanted a free room as there was a hair on the floor or a towel smelled like mold or the view was not that great. Caesar's is an incredible hotel we have stayed at most of them over the years and since it had been a hot minute since we had checked out the latest and greatest did some hotel hopping to see what was what as the pandemic continues.  Yes it is higher end but you get what you pay for. If you shop at Walmart then you probably want the Westgate or Luxor. If you shop at Nieman Marcus then you probably want the Trump Towers or Wynn. If you just are middle of the road who like a nice resort at a mid/higher range price and clientele then you probably want Caesars Bellagio or Cosmopolitan.  We chose Caesars for a night as we were seeing the Rod Stewart concert so wanted the convenience in a lovely hotel. We arrived at 9am and were put off by the cab drop off way down the front and having to drag our luggage up...only to have the only luggage check outdoors with peoples luggage just sitting around until the bellmen moved it inside. We were concerned about security so kept ours with us and told the bellman we were going to try early check in. We had read it was now $75. Bell guy told us it was a very busy weekend and they had been sold out the night before so good luck to us trying to get early check in.  We were greeted by a professional desk attendant who told us they did not have the room ready we requested (Forum Tower 2 Queens) but if we wanted to upgrade for $45 then he would not charge us the $75 early check in since this room was ready. We were in the Palace Tower in a lovely king bed. Interestingly every group checking in were told their rooms were not ready but they could upgrade. It did not matter that the people next to us had a Palace Tower king room but it was not ready so they were upgraded to the Forum Tower with 2 Queens. Funny but this is how they made money....wish they would just give us what we reserved BUT we were happy to have a room at 9am.  It was lovely clean and a very comfortable bed. No complaints whatsoever.  Hotel had Gordon Ramsey Pub and the concert venue so very convenient.    Here is the major drawback! You have to walk a mile to get a taxi since the entire front is now being remodeled. There is a lower level taxi line but you have to walk through the Forum Shops to get to it and that closes at 10pm. If you plan to leave the hotel between 10pm and 10am by taxi (like to the airport) don't stay here. The walk is brutal with luggage.    We will certainly keep this on our list of hotels to consider for the next trip.
20,Caesars Palace is not what it used to be. They charge top prices but provide little to zero service. The hotel is under construction but that is not noted on their website of course. Getting anywhere on this property inside or outside takes forever. The worst part is the HIKE to get a cab or an uber thanks to construction And both lines being super inconveniently located far off the hotel. Even worse- if you have luggage you‚Äôre literally hiking a very very far long walk from any of the hotel towers to get to either the taxi line or rideshare pickup. Even WORSE- if you‚Äôre a golfer and bring clubs the storage area for them is incredibly far from taxi and Uber lines too- meaning a long hike with your clubs to get a ride to the course. Worrying and stressing about how you‚Äôre going to get your luggage to the ride pickup spots on vacation at a nice hotel is not something you should have to constantly get stressing about.    Upon checking in the lines were INSANELY long. Even the self check in kiosks. Once we finally got into the room we called down to the bellman to get our bags sent up. That was a process in itself as hold times are insanely long on the phone and the front desk staff is rude more times than not.    In room dining menu is basically non existent. You can‚Äôt call in room dining either It‚Äôs done via mobile ordering only. We ordered breakfast one morning. There was no option for water on the ordering menu and No place to put notes to request water and when you call from your room  Phone to in room dining nobody answers and an automated message comes up saying to order via the app or online. They charge $12.99 just to bring it to your room and you betcha zero water was brought because Caesars wants to force you to use their expensive Fiji waters in the room.  The breakfast that was brought was absolute unedible trash and I‚Äôm not a picky eater by any means. No salt or pepper was provided either and again you can‚Äôt call for help. Hands down one of the worst breakfasts I‚Äôve had. Waffles were soggy crap without hardly any syrup. Eggs were flavorless. Bacon wasn‚Äôt edible we trashed it. We were charged $100 for 3 breakfast items and coffee and brought zero water. When I called the front desk to inquire about why in room dining didn‚Äôt come with water we were told they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt offer room service it comes from Pronto Griada‚Äù. Well when you scan the QR code it says ‚Äúin room breakfast‚Äù menu. Deceiving to your customers then if it‚Äôs not ‚Äúreal room service‚Äù. I was also told no other places offer ‚Äúreal room service‚Äù yet still due to Covid. Yes they do. I travel all the time. Plenty of places do. Caesars is struggling clearly in staffing operations all around. Charging premium prices but providing no amenities or customer service. Staff is rude with an attitude. If you read the other reviews from around this same time it‚Äôs clear they‚Äôre having issues.  Front desk staff was rude anytime we voiced our concerns.    I had a larger room in the Julius tower and I will say the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was quiet so that was nice. However it was a bit outdated I‚Äôd say. No streaming options on TV no Bluetooth options. Bathroom vanity lights were broken. House keeping was non existent. Room wasn‚Äôt serviced even when the do not disturb sign had been off.    All in all I‚Äôd avoid this hotel until at least the construction is done but really until they get whatever kinks they‚Äôre going through worked out or they lower prices to reflect what they‚Äôre really able to offer their customers.
30,The check in line was 50 deep with 2 people plus maybe the manager when he felt like it.  They said we got an ‚Äúupgraded Room‚Äù! I shutter to think what a non upgraded one looks like.  The room was dated and had peeling wood/veneer on the furniture. The woodwork and the tile in bathroom were covered in dust. We went a full 36 hours before our room was cleaned after the first night. Called down for keurig cups for the coffee maker not included. A water bottle or 2? Not included. God forbid you move something in the automated mini bar you get charged. NO room for your own water that you need to buy in the fridge. Just very disappointed. Of course they would use Covid as an excuse. You get coffee and water at the Borgata in Atlantic City!!  Just mediocre
40,We checked-in at Diamond desk. I give our receptionist Debub a 5-star rating. She has excellent communication skills tries to accommodate your requests and always with a smile. She was even at the front desk when I departed.    Unfortunately I was staying for a week for business and requested a quiet location. CP was booked solid and couldn't accommodate any changes. My room was located at street level facing the busy Flamingo Ave and an accessibility room which I didn't requests. Debub tried her best to find another room but wasn't successful.    The Octavius suite was very clean and provided daily maid service. The rooms are situated where the bedroom is in the middle of the suite and you can't hear the noisy hallways. I turned on the AC to circulate the air or it gets a bit stuffy in the room. The AC actually muffled the traffic noise outside. I give the suite a 3+ star rating.    Thank you Debub for providing 5-star service with a smile!
10,While staying at the Caesar Place (CP) I‚Äôd didn‚Äôt use the AC too cold. So opened the window for fresh air. And smelled fast-food grease from outside/ iIt stink my room and suits. Plus Jacuzzi was not working properly. Then Grabbed a bath towel with mold and mildew on it. After spoken with ‚ÄúOpts. mgr.‚Äùshe didn‚Äôt care and made me want to leave. This is not the Las Vegas experience famous for. I‚Äôve paid for over $2000. I want a refund now.
10,Gave ceasar a second chance after my bad experience when I first time coming to ceasars in Las Vegas second time here now and it‚Äôs still a bad experience went to Chaco in and wanted to upgrade room and was willing to pay for it front desk said there‚Äôs some available but will need to get with my host name maravick after she called my host she then change to there‚Äôs none available? I was mad about that as maravick favors who she likes just like my first time visiting here she gave us a dirty room again like my first time here that is such a nice way to treat seven star members this will be my last time staying in ceasar palace I would rather go to their partner like flamingo or planet Hollywood
20,I was comped 2 nights at Caesars in Las Vegas and did not find out until check in my comped room was on the 1st floor with no view? If I had know this I would have stayed at another property in Vegas. I had to pay $50 a day upcharge to move to a room with a parking lot view that was not on the 1st floor in addition to the daily resort fees. There was nothing comped in the long run on this offer with Caesars in Vegas! The room I was placed in was in need of some updates. I was expecting the rooms at Caesar's in Vegas to be much nicer than the room I paid additional to stay in.
20,At one time {early 1990s} Ceasars was the number one casino in Vegas. No more. Ceasars Palace charges $75.OO to put a bottle of water in the fridge. They charge $15. OO each for in room coffee. Caesars charges $4O.OO for early check in. They charge $3O.OO a night for parking. Caesars charges $5O.OO to cash in your chips at the cashier cage as a surcharge. This all in addition to the resort fee everyone charges. Sadly Las Vegas has become very consumer unfriendly over the years with Caesars leading the charge. Greed rules the United States which is so sad for humans. I know because i have been around. Nice room. Rod Stewart was great! Its crazy how greedy a multi billion dollar corporation like Caesars is. I dont get why so much greed rules the world today .Oh well I just trust in God and joyfully look on the bright side each and every day. It's all good in the hood.
40,First time staying at this hotel and was nervous after reading all the bad reviews.  We stayed in the Octavius tower and our room was large and clean and even had a strip view. No complaints.  The hotel itself was easy to get around  yes the main entrance has construction going on but we ckd into a kiosk and had no issues including no line to wait in.  We did express ck out and I did review the bill snd was charged $85 for a 1 hour early ck in that I  Was not made aware of when I got the email saying my room was ready nor when I ckd into the kiosk.  Ate at Gordon Ramsey‚Äôs a couple times and it is always good.  Like everyone else I think it‚Äôs ridiculous there is no coffee  no water  and you cannot even store your own water in the fridge without being charged.  Other than that it was a great stay and I would stay there again.
30,Spent good money on the room I should have read description better rooms do not come standard with a fridge or microwave you have to rent a fridge for $20 a day. I just filled the sink with ice to keep my sodas cold. Hotel room was non smoking but still smelled like smoke. Blankets were very thin towels were not plush.  Signs within the hotel need to be more frequent and better direction very easy to get lost in due to lack of signs.  I guess I had higher expectations with it being Caesers.
20,Feels run down cleanliness was mediocre and who thought it was a good idea to charge for coffee in the room?!?    Look this started as a 3 star stay and it went to 2 as the week went on. I feel the Hotel has lost its touch with the wants and needs of my age group.
50,I have been impressed with Eric every time I check in. He is so empathetic and his attention to detail and quality is superb. Bravo. He is a big driver behind my loyalty to Caesars. He also brings an outstanding attitude no matter how stressful the circumstance.    -Roy
30,I booked a Julius room and got a free upgrade online to the octavious tower deluxe room. It was big and relatively nice but this was my first stay here and I wasn‚Äôt impressed. My upgraded room had lights that didn‚Äôt work the tub faucet didn‚Äôt work right the headboard was all scuffed up wood baseboards falling off & worst of all had a toilet that sounded like a whistling nail on a chalkboard sound every 3 minutes that was so bad I had to close the toilet bathroom door the bathtub door just to be able to sleep. It‚Äôs far too much trouble to contact them about anything so I just tried to ignore it but I would never pay for this upgrade I had‚Äî-ever.  Not to mention when I checked in at the kiosk it gave me directions to my room but I later found out the kiosk location is irrelevant. So I had directions from a octavious lobby but I was in the lobby next to self parking so the directions weren‚Äôt even correct!!!! Then when it came time to leave the parking garage I didn‚Äôt understand how to use my room key to get out. I stuck it in the slot but nothing happened. Luckily I am platinum so I got free parking so I scanned that key to get out. I just don‚Äôt really understand it. I also had issues with Cherry at the rewards counter that set up my card and then didn‚Äôt give me a PIN number. I had to stand in line almost an hour extra because of her mistake. Unfortunately Caesar‚Äôs and I lost out on any play I would have done in the machine since I was short on time and had to waste my time standing in line to fix inadequate employee problems at the casino.  It‚Äôs a wonderful location‚Ä¶  I wouldn‚Äôt stay here again for the $300 price. Venetian all the way!!
10,Too big of a hotel for the staff. Even finding staff to answer questions was hard. Long lines everywhere and no reservations available at any restaurant. Package center unavailable and never returned messages. Could not order a pot of coffee for the morning. Won‚Äôt do it. Room service said 1.5-2 hours. Never staying here again
10,They are under construction. You can get no help with your bags. You have to walk forever to get inside the property. Upon leaving the taxi line is located out by the strip and you have to walk even farther. I was traveling for business and my conference was at this hotel but I would highly recommend any of the MGM hotels Venetian or the Wynn over Caesars right now. It is crazy and when you say something there answer is ‚Äúya we don‚Äôt like it either. Where is the management on this?
50,This review is long over due but I still want to give accolades to Eric in the 7 stars/Diamond check in. He was so very pleasant and helpful. I realize that the people working in this division/area are probably the best of the best because they are dealing with the high money/ big rollers. I am not one of those. Without going into to details let's just say that Eric went out of his way to help me with getting a room and actually made some calls for me to the the casino host area to follow up with my inquiries. in my opinion Caesars remains onw of the best hotels on the strip.
10,wow...what happened? What a dump! With service to match. If you want to check in easily best to arrive after 9:00 PM. Otherwise you wait in line for over an hour. Literally hundreds of people waiting over an hour. Think you can do the on line check in? Forget it....you still wait in line to get to one of three kiosks. THREE! No COVID excuses here.....they have three kiosks. And be warned....DO NOT TOUCH THE MINI BAR IN THE ROOM! All items noth inside and outside the frig are on pressure switches and if you move an item just move it a purchase is recorded automatically. Plus service fees. What happens in Vegas....ducks. take Little Caesars over this Caesars. Wretched rip off.
10,This has to be one of the worst hotel experiences I have had in my life. Showed up early stood in line for 15 min and tried to check in hoping to get a room was told I would have to wait until 4-6 pm but realistically 6 pm for a room. If I wanted they could give me my same room for $60 extra for early check in or I could upgrade for another $50 a night a get a room right away. (But MY ROOM WASNT AVAILABLE) I declined they took my credit card and phone number with a call back promise.  Never got call back and once again had to stand in line for 15-20 minutes to finally get a room. (See picture)    All restaurants had very long lines and food quality was very poor. Front desk staff rude and unhelpful. With so many choices in Las Vegas stay away from this property.
30,This hotel used to be very high end and nice. Its wore down now and extremely over priced. Our toilet barely worked. We had to get the ice bucket and constantly put water in the tank to be able to get it to flush. Then it would take 20 -30 minutes to refill before it can be used again. We called for maintenance and they sent someone with a light bulb instead. When we asked him about the toilet he said they are all like that.  Second- the food is so overpriced! We couldnt get 2 meals for under $60 anywhere. And they werent even that good of meals. We went to Venetian which is a much higher end hotel and got way better food for way less!  Third- mattress sucked and sofa in room was so wore out it was terrible uncomfortable.  I only stayed there for a business conference and will never stay there again.
20,"We are 3 days into a 6 day trip and I am ready to change hotels to another one on the strip. This hotel is horrible. We waited forever to check in after a 4 hour flight delay put us in late. I had done the early check in on the app but apparently the hotel never got it. So after waiting forever to check in our king size room which was confirmed was turned into 2 ""queens"" (they were doubles). When I asked about it the front desk employee told me rooms were assinged at check in and there was not one king bed available in the entire hotel. We were able to change rooms the following day to get out of the Julius tower which I have stayed in nicer Holiday Inns.    Room service is a joke - you can't call and order it all has to be done online or through the app. After receiving confirmation via text and the app our food hadn't arrived after 2 hours. It took talking to 3 different employees before they said the order was never received.    All around horrible customer service and a horrible vacation experience. I would not recommend this hotel or ever stay here again. You are paying for the name only - not good service."
10,Very disappointed! First you have to check in with a kiosk no personal service. If checking in early a $40 up charge. Room has Keurig however if you want coffee you have to purchase it at a ridiculously high price. No soap in the room. No back up toilet paper. Definitely not what you expect from a high end hotel. I‚Äôve stayed here before and this will be my last.
20,Positives: valet staff at VIP entrance were extremely helpful with golf bags and pick up location during their construction and the casino floor staff were nice & chatty.  Negatives: hookers brazenly & openly working the main lobby & Starbucks at 7 AM watched them harrass guests and no security; no cell phone service in rooms (dead zones); slowest guest wi-fi; wait in line 30+ minutes at cage to cash out; even comp'd I could not get a room key before 4pm without a $75 charge. Took forever to get through to the front desk and on hold another 30 minutes for casino host. All-in-all I would not stay here again. Back to MGM for sure.
20,My biggest complaint is the disaster at check-in and the lack of tools. I signed up for the kiosk check-in and after delays I arrived after 11 pm. The self-check-in kiosks close at 11 pm ( brilliant management ) and I was forced to stand in line for over an hour to get my room key. Also and this is brilliant the VIP guests get to skip the line! So while I was up every time a ‚Äú VIP ‚Äú showed up I had to be cut.    What's the incompetence/excuse for not having the self-serve kiosks running 24/7? Can someone answer this? This hotel is worth billions of dollars but they can't solve self-service check-in with a mobile app or a kiosk? Yet they want you to come back time and again?    I'll stay elsewhere keep all your policies in place and hopefully other people like me follow suit. Bye-bye Ceasers Palace.
20,Our room was actually really nice with a good view. Beyond that they so nickel and dime you! $75 if you want to check in early or late. $75 if you want to put stuff in the mini fridge. No free upgrade--you'll have to pay for it. Pool was closed one day for a party. There was no discount for this or notification. When I complained--I was told I didn't have a right to expect amenities-- you know the ones that led me to book the hotel. Also there is basically no maid service. I understand them not cleaning your room but they could drop off supplies and empty garbage on a daily basis. Also tons of people without masks. I saw them ask folks to put theirs on once.
50,The trip was outstanding and we will return to Caesars Palace for our next visit to Vegas! Fantastic birthday celebration at Gordon Ramsay‚Äôs Pub & Grill continued the night with Lady Gaga show and ended the night at Vista Cocktail Lounge! Oh what a night!!!
20,Chapter 1. Cars  For those that are fans of labyrinths Caesar's Palace lets you enjoy one as you try to figure out where the f--- to park or valet. I've been told some of this is due to construction but hopefully they are just building more tunnels without signs. You have to walk back through the labyrinth about a quarter mile to find your driver. Clearly just to keep you from having a heart attack after eating their food.    Chapter 2. The Room  We decided to upgrade. We had a Pool View Suite- theoretically. I suggest bringing your local window cleaner with you. If you don't you'll find that you must hop from dirt hole to dirt hole to try and see the pool. Others may choose to just not try but at some point there were synchronized swimmers which is my husband's fourth favorite thing in the world so we put in the effort. Also the handle for the blinds fell off into my hands which made closing them difficult.    Chapter 3. The Saga of the Bottle Opener  We sat down to have a beer but couldn't because there wasn't a bottle opener in the minibar. I called housekeeping. At Caesar's Palace properties you are sent to a ***call center***. I spent 20 minutes while a woman on the other side of the planet typed away like I was arranging an international flight in 1962 instead of asking housekeeping for the bottle opener (the bottle opener the bellman told us would be in the minibar to facilitate opening the beer they sell in the minibar). She was not able to help me. My husband who in ten years has never been mildly irritated at a service person got on the phone and was soon a completely different person (we had to get divorced). Ten minutes later names and managers had been asked for (and denied) and he was stomp-marching down the hallway. It was only later that I discovered the synchronized swimmers had been in the lobby doing a synchronized land dance and he'd been forced to look away in order to not accidentally be put into a good mood prior to screaming at a low-level manager. The next day he hunted down and screamed at a mid-level manager. Promises were made reader and promises were broken. I regret to inform you that we were never able to get a bottle opener and on that not as bitter as the IPA I wanted to drink note I will end this tale.    Postscript: they charged us for the minibar things we moved while searching for the bottle opener and obviously I'm not serious about drinking an IPA that is so 2014.
20,I found the rooms to be average and in need of updated bedding. I was charged for a mini bar item or items that I did not utilize. The hotel billing itself is very confusing and does not add up I have run the math a dozen times and come to same same conclusion that I am being overcharged both for the room with a mystery charge not identified on my bill as well as the mini bar item(s). Buyer beware I will not stay here again.
10,I would give zero stars if I could‚Ä¶ we arrived at caesars palace on 10/08/21 around 3 am for some drinks and to gamble. I was with a group of 6 people. 3 people in the group were black. We sat at a bar near the casino. It wasn‚Äôt busy at all there were about 4 people at the bar who already had drinks. The bartender walked past us several times and looked at us over and over without saying a word. About 10 minutes past and we tried to politely get the bartender ray ray‚Äôs attention. He continued to ignore us. It was quite obvious he was deliberately ignoring us. He would only serve the WHITE customers at the other side of the bar. Two people from our group were upset about the situation and decided to take their money to another bar. My boyfriend who is black wanted to give the man a chance. Mind you 4 people in our group work in the service industry and are bartenders‚Ä¶.including myself. Time goes by and he FINALLY asks for our drink order. The problem was is he would only talk to the white people in the group!!! He ignored my boyfriend who was paying for me and my other friend who was black. ‚ÄúRay ray‚Äù was VERY rude and tasteless. We were recommended to come to caesars palace by my boyfriends uncle who is a high roller. My boyfriend wanted to gamble prior to this racial incident but because of this experience we left and did not return the rest of our stay. I tried to call the hotel to tell them about our experience and it seemed as if no one cared. I will be reporting this incident to different organizations. The Las Vegas strip was the last place we expected to encounter this type of treatment. I expected the bartenders at caesars palace to be a little more professional‚Ä¶.
30,We received a room in the Forum Tower. It was clearly outdated. The wifi connection was pretty terrible even though it was the wifi meant for guests and it covered up to three devices per the front desk. We had to call the help line at least three times during our stay.    We tried watching TV on the second day and it did not work. Front desk said it was a hotel wide issue and working on it. Worked later that day.    The first day housekeeping came. The other days they didn't not sure why. We had to call for towels after two days of no house keeping. No our privacy light was not on we made sure of this. The hotel itself was beautiful and very large loved the fountain. The Atlantis show was not going on that was disappointing.    Be ready to walk quite a bit but that is normal in vegas. We liked the casino and shops restaurant options were okay. The buffet was awful and so not worth the money beware.    The only other thing worth mentioning is that if you are using a debit card as opposed to a credit card they will place a hold $100 per day which was fine. However the early check in fee goes up by 25% if you are using a debit card.
50,Man! It‚Äôs usually no cup of tea checking in twenty firefighters much less in busy Vegas. But Zandra held it down and checked in our group in short time despite a couple hiccups with the names on our reservation. A great start to a great stay at Caesar‚Äôs. Thanks Zandra!
40,Got in early on Monday because SW fiasco. Arrived to find a long line at check-in which took about 45 mins for us to be seen because some guests kept returning complaining about their keys not working and only 3 employees to check you in. When we finally got to check in Joselyn the night supervisor thanked us for our patience and checked us in. When we inquired about an upgrade which she informed us that we were down for Octavios Petite Suite she also informed us about Julius Signature Level suite which would be a little smaller than Octavius. We agreed to Julius Signature Level suite got a discount because we arrived late ( also had called to advise of our delay which was noted)  The suite is beautiful 15th floor is quiet and I enjoyed the private elevator. We used the app to order from Beijing Noodles 9 and there is a $3 for pickup at restaurant...Which is right next to the elevators. Our view was of the pools which were beautiful.  Received great service for Rene at Americano Cafe for breakfast. Like that it's two Starbucks though hours of operation... Opening was delayed. Bottom line Joselyn turned our experience from potentially bad to good then the staff on property was great. Housekeeping did a wonderful job daily cleaning. It's a challenging time all around in the service industry for keeping employees or having them show up but the professionalism shown to us at Caesars is very appreciated. Keep up the great work and continue to appreciate the employees you have. For guests patience and kindness still go a long way.
50,Tangela at the front desk was amazing! She had a great personality great sense of humor and was very knowledgeable. We really appreciated her service and efforts. I would definitely hire Tangela to handle the customer service portion of my business.
20,I understand that check in is at 4 and no big deal with that. But you wait in line and get up to the desk at 3:35 and they try and charge you an early check in fee or if you pay for an upgrade they can accomodate right away. Since it was just 20 minutes to 4 we decided to wait. They said our rooms were on the same floor and the same tower (we had two). Then once you receive a text you wait in another line to get your key. That didn't work either. All said and done we got in our room at 6 and had to wait two hours. It was really a bummer of our whole trip as we missed our dinner reservation. I will never stay at Ceasars Palace again. Oh on top of that because of construction they make you walk a long distance to reach the lobby. And if you want a cab to go somewhere you walk way out on to the street. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!
10,I thought I upgraded to Augustus and the room is run down. It‚Äôs old furniture is in bad condition the carpet is really broken down you can see the heavy traffic signs. In addition the room lacked USB outlets and Netflix (my personal thing) on the television.    Furthermore when I made my reservations online I was told I could get a complimentary upgrade to the next member tier. I went to Caesars rewards counter only to be told no. I applied for my veterans card online and I was given a digital Va card. Caesars did not accept it. Then they asked me for my ID. They didn‚Äôt accept it because the expiration date is today (my birthday October 12) The supervisor said the DL expired last night at midnight and therefore not valid today (10/12/2021). She asked me for a different ID and I presented my gov CAC card. She again could not accept by Caesars policy apparently. So I wasted 30 min of my life standing in line so I could be rejected. I also offered to show my DD214 letter which was also denied.    Old hotel. Bad customer service. And I reserved 4 rooms for 4 nights. Smh. Never staying here again.    The counter lady was really nice she even went to ask in the back if I was good with my digital VA card and she was told yes. But when another person came to help her everything went downhill from there. I‚Äôm assuming it was the supervisor.
20,This was my first stay at Caesar‚Äôs so I have nothing else to compare with this experience. We get there for a work trip only to see teenagers running amuck all over the resort. We soon find out that it is fall break for 10 colleges and they were given a super cheap promotional package deal to come and stay. They were promised 2 parties a day with open bars (per the drunk teens). We paid over $450 dollars a night to be surrounded by loud drunk teenagers!!!!! The couple I was with overhead their neighbor kids bragging about all of the drugs they scored. They then went on to smoke weed in their room for days on end until my friends had to be moved away from them! The front desk fought this at first and stated the fire alarm would go off if they were smoking. I‚Äôm pretty sure we all got s contact high just walking past the door.  Our neighbor kids got into a fist fight our last night there. One of them was thrown into our wall at 3am!! I seriously wondered if house keeping would have to clean off brain matter after the force of the impact! My husband and I nearly had a heart attack from fright!! Needless to say it was a horrible stay and I don‚Äôt know if we will every be back!!
40,One of the most popular hotels in Las Vegas Caesars Palace offers many shops restaurants casino games and a fantastic pool in the Garden of the Gods. We did arrive on a Monday night so the check in line but by Thursday we could see where there was quite a line to check in. With most things in Vegas drinks and food were expensive when they were not complimentary with gambling. $10 water $10 Pringles in the room etc.    The casino offered many different games and were normally hovering around $15 to $25 minimums for black jack.    If you want to explore many of the other casinos are well within walking distance as well!
10,Booked this hotel 09/18 - 09/24 to celebrate my husband's birthday seeing that he loved caesar. Was our first vacation since getting married. Booked a RSV king room. Upon arrival we were told that we were upgraded but we ended up getting a beautiful view of the parking lot with 2 beds nevertheless. After 3 days in the room not being able to breathe having respiratory and sinus problems and being awaken with a blocked throat and congested nose i then discovered the terror that was dust build up in the vent that seemed as if it was there for years. Informed front desk which did nothing. Second time around it was never cleaned so spoke to the FD manager who agreed to refund the resort fee but still nothing was done for the dust build up. Stayed in room 1405. In all overpriced for a terrible service horrible room and catastrophic first experience. Never again!
50,Abbey was so helpful. Had an issue checking with check in in the main lobby so went to the Diamond checkin with Abbey and she was amazing and too care of the issue. Abbey is the best. Wouldn‚Äôt go back to Caesars without awesome employees like Abbey
10,No fridge in room. Promo wasn‚Äôt added to my account. Stood in 2 lines 4 times to fix. No apologies. Terrible service. VIP lines are worthless. Stood in one for over an hour. Numerous other problems as well and no one cares. I will never hear from Caesar‚Äôs about my experience. Guaranteed.
10,When I arrived to the hotel they told my room is not available and they gave another room which turned out to be smaller and older than the room I reserved. When I complained to the manager ‚ÄúR‚Äù she said that‚Äôs what have and since I reserved my room with group rate I would have to accept what they give me. The manager was very rude and unprofessional. I had to discuss the matter for over half an hour with the manager until she said and I quote: well if we have the room you reserved tomorrow we will move you unquote.  Apparently if you reserve your room through a group rate you will not get what you reserve.  I will never stay at that hotel again and I don‚Äôt recommend it to anyone.
30,When you arrive plan to wait in a very long slow line. Only 4 employees checking-in a 100 people. Less than an hour until check-in charged $45. If not prepare to carry your bags everywhere (casino/strip). Found an empty condom wrapper behind the nightstand. I guess we weren‚Äôt the only ones ‚Äúscrewed.‚Äù
10,"Hi there I called in about an hour ago wanting to send my Mother a bottle of Moet for her wedding tomorrow (I live in Thailand so this was going to have to be ordered and paid over the phone).    I explained this to the first person I spoke to  who refused to transfer me and gave me another number to call. When I called that number I explained again in full what I wanted to do and I was transferred to another department.    The woman who answered the guest services line did so rudely. I tried to overlook it and I then explained for a third time what I wanted to do and her response was ""yeah you can't do that.""    She didn't explain why I couldn't and when I tried clarifying saying ""hang on you're telling me there's no room service at Caesar's Palace? I have the room service menu right in front of me"" instead of explaining the reason why I couldn't she just said ""no you can't"" extremely rudely.    I then asked to be transferred to a manager. The manager -- the FOURTH person I spoke to -- was the FIRST person to explain to me that room service at CP is shut down at the moment due to Covid.    Fair enough -- but I don't understand why no one else explained this to me from the GET GO before wasting my time and transferring me or having me call back and jump through hoops. I'm appalled by your hotel's customer service and plan to put this up as a review on your Facebook TripAdvisor and any other platforms I can find.    I feel so disrespected for absolutely no reason other than the fact I was trying to do a nice thing for my mother on her special day.    Shame on you and your customer service team Caesar's Palace."
30,The hotel main pool was closed off Sunday mod day for a beer conference. The restaurant‚Äôs were also bought out and closed by this company. We had to beg for room service to have our room cleaned on the second day of using dirty towels. We asked three times to please clean our room and refresh our towels. It‚Äôs took 36 hours to get this done. We choose this hotel because of location and appearance but was very much so disappointed in amenities being closed due to a conference after we paid resort fees for common grounds. Also after booking through Expedia we are hit up with resort fees $50 plus dollars per day when checking out at Caesars. Renter beware!!!
30,check in system down had tospend 2 hours waiting in line- and we had done express check in.  room dated  50.00 resort fee and our room did not even come with a complimentary coffee pod for the coffee maker
10,I registered employees for two nights for a conference. Evidently one of the guys I registered had the same name as someone else staying the same nights. He was treated terribly every day he was there returning to his room being unlocked and wide open being accused by security of not being who he is issues with his key card to get into his room being accused of not showing up. Then he was compensated for this daily treatment with a free late check out. Seriously? I am very unhappy about this. My company spends thousands at Caesar's Palace at least every other year if not multiple times per year. This was terrible customer service and should have been verified with address or other information upon arrival and rectified. At a minimum it certainly should have been taken care of and never happened again after the first night. He is a very easy going person and did not make demands on the hotel. However I am the one who books all these trips and I am not happy this occurred.
10,The worst hotel i have ever Visited and here is why:    1- our visit started with w very bad welcoming from the front disk staff.  So we came at 3:30 PM and they wanted me to pay 40$ to let me check in before 4:00 pm although i called them before i arrive and they said you can come and no one mentioned the 40$ extra.    I told her i will wait and i came back at 3:55 so i can get the keys... the front desk worker was like so you decided to pay the 40$ for early check in? What!!! Seriously!! 5 minutes before 4:00 PM .. so i had to wait for another 5 minutes and they gave me the keys not a minute before 4:00.    2- although i choose a room that is supposed to have a good view they gave me a 1 star hotel room with a view over a roof of a short building with airconditioner compressors all around you and i went to the front desk to try to get a better room and her answer was: we are fully booked try again tomorrow thats when i asked to talk to the manager and he wasnt a great help as well .. so i had to pay extra 120 $ just to be transferred to another room .. very dissappointing! I reallt tried to refund my money at that point but i couldnt !    3- my new room was good but i have to say that customer service at this hotel is really really bad.. they have many customers that they dont care about you! No body is welling to help!    4- major draw back! Internet sucks!! Its too freaking slow!    The only good thing about this hotel is its location but will never ever visit again!
20,I was booked at the Las Vegas Caesars for a conference and was very disappointed with my stay. First of all guests should have been advised the main arrival entry was under construction and you will have a long walk to check-in. They need to hire my bell services staff. I was initially booked in the Octavius Premium room and was told upon check-in that I was being upgraded to the brand-new tower ‚ÄúPalace Tower.‚Äù Really. When you offer a guest an upgrade is should mean you are offer something much better than what the guest booked. I was very unable with the accommodations of the room along with many other agents. The curtains were stan the dresser was outdated with mood stand and I saw this many of the rooms and I requested to have my room cleaned the next day upon check-in three times and it wasn‚Äôt done. One positive note I would say the bed was very comfortable. Networking and speaking with my travel partners everyone was quoted different rates for everything across the board at this hotel (early check-in incidental charges pre-arrival rates and so much more). Sorry to say it‚Äôs a hotel that I will not promote nor advertise to my clients.
10,We stayed at the Aria for most of our trip but our flight home got pushed back so we had to make a last minute booking and chose Caesar‚Äôs palace. Huge mistake. The room the elevator and the hallways were like something out of a low budget horror movie. The room was dark and dingy the furniture was all battered and the couches looked like you‚Äôd get an STD if you touched them. The bathroom was passable that was the only thing it had going for it. Don‚Äôt stay here visit the casino and the shopping mall they are nice but don‚Äôt spend your money to stay here.
10,The casino was dirty and outdated. The parking garage was in need of a deep clean and power wash.    Our expensive room was very WORN OUT. The carpet was worn the windows were dirty the furniture was banged up the grout was wearing away and the duvet had a hole in it just to name a few things wrong. Masks were required in the casino but it was still crowded and smoky.    The strip smelled of marijuana and was crowded with young dancers and strung out junkies. I can wait another 15 years to return to Vegas.
40,The check in wasn‚Äôt too bad. There‚Äôs a bit of a wait but they‚Äôre moving pretty fast. The cleaning crew did a good job every day. The property is pretty decent. The headboard in our room was torn so you experience stuff like that. The property itself is generally clean. The service on the resort was good and it‚Äôs in a location on the strip.
10,Booked and paid for a pool view room and got a room overlooking the construction site in front. I complained but the manager at front desk did not care at all. Food at Americano Cafe is horrible. I‚Äôve had better food at airports. $51 a day for resort fee is a waste. WiFi is horrible and you can‚Äôt even get a coffee in the room. They charge additional for that. By the way no valet either.
50,Eric at Caesars Palace VIP Registration was very informative and gives great customer service. Answered all of our questions and knows a lot about the property and its offerings. Always enjoy our stay at Caesars Palace. Thank you.
50,The hotel was amazing the slots the blackjack tables the people the atmosohere the baccanal buffet was a delight the room was awesome very clean and spacious the staff always with a smile on their face in a few words the best trip!!
50,Room was great with a view. Service was excellent. I felt safe and secure with the health protocols put in place. Will be back soon!! Parts of hotel was under construction but they navigated us around that with no issues. Same old Caesars excellent service!!
30,The hotel was nice but all the added costs like resort fees and paying for wifi was bit over the top.  In the hotel room you can hear other people in the next room and very loud from the hall way. The hotel vents also allowed cigarette smoke in the room. It was not nice having this smell in the room each time the air conditioner would turn on. It was like someone was smoking in the room. The beds were good but MAKE SURE YOU CHECK OUT! we had all these extra's cost for the mini bar that we didn't touch. The ladies beside us had the same issue and if we had not spotted this and request the hotel to reverse the charges we would have be charged! I felt cheated and scammed. If it we just us I would think it was just an honest mistake but when the other's beside had the same issue and a lot more charges it seemed very fishy. I wouldn't stay there again for the smoke smell and the scam at check out.
50,Being a Diamond Member for a lifetime i have never experience such great service and hospitality as i received today by front desk clerk Zandra..Wow I really suggest Caesars Palace as you hotel of choice when in Las Vegas..Hope this email finds the right person as I'm sure she treats every guest the same great service.  Thank you for your welcoming greatly appreciated..    Mike E
50,hotel room was nice clean bathroom was big and was split out so multiple users could be in their at same time. Had a small view of the Bellagio water show so that was a bonus. - not sure why the minimum charc for a review is 200 that's crazy.
30,Overall hotel is huge we were always getting lost.Our room was run down. The lamp had the lightbulbs hanging from the wires sideways the back board of bed was ripped the other light was burnt out. The pool was beyond freezing my lips were blue and no one was in the pool. Everyone complained about it.
10,Upon check in I find they have GIVEN my suite away for my bachelorette weekend. The suite i booked 2 months in advance and confirmed 1 week prior to arriving and again 1 day prior to arriving. It took Florente 45 minutes of disappearing twice to finally give us an aged suite at 6:30 pm. I still have not received my itemized bill for the suite just a bill for $1500 more than I was shown upon check in. I was informed we had access to the spa--a lie. Spa mgrwhile being rude said he had never heard of such a thing then disappeared to 'check on' the issue and never reappeared. So-called personal concierge for our suite was a bot that kept texting advertisements with no real help at all. Stay someplace else. Caesars has gone to the dogs since it was sold. BTW smokiest casino on the strip. I think they shut off their air purifying system except in the 7 Diamond area of course.
40,Celebrated my 50th birthday in the Emperor‚Äôs Duplex suite also known as the ‚ÄúHangover Suite‚Äù and the ‚ÄúRainman Suite‚Äù as it was featured in those movies.    I had 20 guests over and everyone had plenty of space to social distance if desired. We could‚Äôve also all been seated comfortably at the same time that‚Äôs how much space is available.    Karaoke on the mini stage with the strip view in the background was super cool. The location near the super fast elevators was good for us but probably a nightmare for those that had to hear our bad singing.    Overall stay was fantastic but if I did have a recommendation it would be to upgrade the extremely stained downstairs carpet while the sofas could also use a serious cleaning or replacing. Then again it IS the ultimately party sweet‚Ä¶ pun intended.
20,The room is too small and the cleaning service too bad the internet never worked and the operator service no answer correctly I request check out late only for 30 minutes and charge me 50 Dlls. I will never will stay in this hotel.
10,I rarely write reviews and I rarely write negative reviews. I have been home for 10 days now and feel I have to write this to stop someone from choosing Caesars Palace. I have been to Vegas 50+ times and have stayed at many hotels there but mainly stick to caesars rewards properties. My husband and best friend and I were excited about returning to Vegas after a year and a half. We were comped at the Flamingo. A few days before we left Caesar‚Äôs Palace came up with great prices so we decided to switch. I had stayed there before and loved it. My husband and best friend had not yet but wanted to. We were going to have a couple of pool days and I told them how much they‚Äôd love the pools. Because my friend Jennie was on her own we booked the same tower Julius so we‚Äôd be heading in the same direction at the end of the night. When we arrived to check in we agreed to pay the $40+ dollars for early check in. They put us in Palace tower. I said no we have to be in the same as my friend. They said she was upgraded (free) to the Augustus Tower but her room wouldn‚Äôt be ready until 4:00. I didn‚Äôt want her to lose the nicer room upgrade but they wouldn‚Äôt give one to us so I agreed to pay another $40+ per night to be in the same tower. We asked THREE times if they were certain we‚Äôd be in the same tower when it came time for Jennie‚Äôs room to be ready and they (Raven and Gemma) said absolutely we would all be in the Augustus tower. You can probably guess which way this is going‚Ä¶ So 60 minutes to check in and I‚Äôm already down $200. At 8:00 pm Jennie still hadn‚Äôt received notification that her room was ready so we headed to the registration desk again to ask. Her room was ready and they forgot to contact her and she was now in the Palace tower. We explained what we were promised so I said move her to the Augustus and they said there were no more rooms. So we said move us to Palace and they said there were no more rooms. But interestingly enough I could book each of those room types on line‚Ä¶ or move us back to the original Julius rooms we booked. And refund my upgrade money. Austin and Jocelyn said we would get only one night refunded (and that didn‚Äôt happen without a fight at checkout). We booked the same room type for a reason!!! So that was how our long awaited Vegas vacation began and Caesar‚Äôs Palace continued to be a disappointment throughout our stay. We constantly felt like it was a bother for us to be there. We did not get our room cleaned the first day and had to phone to get it done the rest of the time. Coffee is $20+ in the mini bar but no coffee cups to make it with. Wine is $80+ in the mini bar but no wine glasses to drink it with. I asked for some wine glasses to be sent up and I was told they could bring paper! Seriously!? My husband stopped at the lobby bar to get a couple of plastic go cups and they wanted to charge him. The pools ( I should say pool because only one had free access) was ice cold and we never had one server ask us if we wanted anything. There is NO security at the elevators or room key card needed to go up. Anybody off the street has free reign in the hotel. I encountered a couple of fights in my hallway on my way up at night and did not feel safe! Vagrants were in the pools at the front. Taxi stand was inconvenient with luggage and heat. Lobby cafe $30 for cold eggs and ham and toast. Ticket cashing machines in the casino keep your change now. This happening at many casinos. Hilarious. I could go on but I‚Äôm sure you catch what I‚Äôm saying. It should have been a great experience. It was beyond bad. I am still pushing to get my upgrade money back. We‚Äôll see how that goes‚Ä¶
20,My wife and I were married at Caesar's Palace 18 years ago and haven't stayed there since. I booked this trip as a surprise. The real surprise occurred when we entered our room. I made reservations for a premium king room and was disappointed to learn that we were placed in a room with double beds. I called the front desk and learned that they had overbooked rooms and there were no other rooms available and that's why they gave us the room with double beds. I explained our situation and the only thing they could offer was a lousy dismissal of one of the $45 resort fees! I was thoroughly disappointed and do not plan to go back to the hotel. You should get the room you pay for!
40,outside everything is perfect but once you get into your room furniture is old and in bad conditions bed is not as clean as expected bathroom smells bad carpet dirty and old  seems to be a low profile room.  front desk employees sometimes are rude and not willing to help or explain some doubts about the property
30,The bath tube and shower had trouble draining and the blower for the bath tub would not work. We were on the 20th floor but could hear loud music until 2 am. We got charged for a movie we did not watch.
40,The hotel on the outside is a confusing mess of construction. I was dropped off by a friend after lunch and after being told to turn around not not told where to go I finally just jumped out and made a run for it with my luggage much to the dismay of the parking attendant.    The lobby was busy mostly due to the bar I opted for the self checkin kiosk as I had already checked in online. Honestly I liked the kiosk experience. It was simple and quick‚Ä¶spit out my keys and room number as expected. Once you checkin you have access to the app to use during your stay.    Stayed in the Palace Tower Studio Suite. The room was bigger than my first apartment. Mine and mine bathrooms walk thru shower (no bench or foot rest to shave your legs though) tub and if you feel inclined a bidet. Personally the vanity area was my fav although the light could of been brighter. The bed area was standard and the sectional was a nice touch. View of the pool was great and you could see the new stadium. The bed was comfy‚Ä¶a little too mushy but still good. The night stands has some crusty stuff on them and the phone was super dusty. But covid prepared me for that and I wiped it off with a Clorox wipe. Kurig is in the room for coffee byo kcups as the ones in the room are 20 bucks from the mini bar.    While at the hotel we spent most the time at the pool. The first day we had a cabana and the second a daybed. The pool host was amazing he really made our pool experience great. Also they do a ‚Äúcase‚Äù of beers and seltzers which came out to you in a cooler and really not a bad deal for Vegas poolside.    The food situation was what was kind of disappointing. ‚ÄúRoom Service‚Äù has morphed into Caesar Eats and the selection is not great. There is no real room service menu it‚Äôs a select menu from several restaurants that will be delivered to you wadded up in a bag and lukewarm. The first night as I was getting ready I ordered the Beijing Noodle place‚Ä¶it was bland and overpriced. Breakfast was the sausage sandwich from Pronto which was great‚Ä¶we ordered it for pick up but it too so long we just went and stood in line canceled the order that they still hadn‚Äôt processed and ordered from the register. If you want to eat like a kindergartner after a night out of drinking you will have to find other arrangements‚Ä¶no chicken fingers fries and ranch -or anything open after 10.    Bars in the casinos don‚Äôt stay open as late so as they close they direct you to another. The pool menu was very limited as all food items had to be brought to you pre packaged. The drinks were good and the cooler thing is a great idea. I do not fault anyone but sometimes it took longer that you‚Äôd expect to have the waitstaff come around. That‚Äôs everywhere right now so remember to be nice and tip.    The app thing is a great concept and the map was something I‚Äôd use IF I could get service on my phone. Upon entering the hotel it‚Äôs if you‚Äôre in a black hole of cell service. You can use the WiFi as a guest but really it only works in your room. The map has a direction thing but you can‚Äôt follow yourself moving and it‚Äôs directional list has no directions on it at all. The hotel casino is large and I walked around for 30 mins trying to find the Uber area lol.    Checkout was easily completed online and they were very helpful when they accidentally charged me twice for my daybed. The pool manager and front desk agent were prompt and understanding of the situation and were able to correct it right away. By the time my final folio was emailed it was correct as was the final charge on my cc. I truly appreciate that!    Caesar‚Äôs is a classic happy to have checked it off the list!
30,Booked this trip for my husband's 38th birthday. Booked a basic king room with no specific view. Upon check in we were told we were upgraded. Turns out the upgrade was a parking lot view room with 2 queen beds. Like really? Stop misusing the word upgrade which means better than. Nothing was better than what we originally booked instead we got 2 beds with a view of your beautifully paved parking lot.  During check in we were having some trouble with our card turns out Cici ended up putting 2 holds on my card instead of 1 then denied it.  When getting to the room basic at best which i was expecting.  We booked 6 nights but made it for 5.  After 3 nights of suffering with sinus and breathing problems i thought it wad the heat turns out it was the filthy dusty dirty air vents and curtains in the room. Because of the massive dust build up by and on the air vent in the room we had a hard time sleeping and staying asleep.  My nose got blocked itchy at night i would feel like my throat was closing could barely breathe and woke up gasping for air. Felt like i was being chocked in my sleep it was truly horrible.  I took pics and reported it to the front desk in the morning offered a room change but we said no we simply wanted the curtains changed and vent cleaned. Came back at night nothing was done this time asked for a manager Austin requested the same thing but like i said we simply wanted it cleaned. He arranged for the resort fee refund.  For check out apparently it was never clear and nothing was done so we had to remind the same front desk clerk we reported to the first time about our room. She doubled checked and did the necessary.  This was my husband's 2nd stay and my 1st. Before booking he insisted on staying at caesars but now we've agreed to never stay there again. It seems like non caesars award members get treated differently. Our first vacation together since getting married and it was the absolute worst!
10,Worst hotel experience of my life. Nothing but problems from the time I arrived on site. Horrible customer service in the sense that you will be met w smiles and a nice attitude bit when it comes to ACTUAL answers to questions or ACTUAL help with something it's awful. No hot water one morning no housekeeping one day several things in the room didn't work and didn't get fixed for days. Very few dining choices and access. Gym opens at 7 (never seen that in my life) and is so small for such a large resort it's packed. I could keep going but just awful.
20,some things are out of their control. Construction line ups.etc. However  be prepared to be gouged at bars and restaurants and their shops. like bacon and eggs  and a glass of oj ? 35 cdn . how about a small pack of skittles from mini bar 17.34 cdn  while cocktail service is decent drinks are below par. if you use the mini bar for your own use 75.00 . diamond members would be able to chose from 2 shows..no more. diamond lounge closed. i really dont expect to win there or at any casino for that matter. to me its about play time and entertainment value. neither of which i recieved
10,Caesars Palace was once one of the best hotels on the strip but is now one of the worst.    Our check in took around an hour and 20 minutes. We then got greeted by one of the worst and rudest people i have ever met. She spoke to me like I was stupid rolled her eyes when asked anything and her behaviour was disgusting. It almost ruined our trip when we hadn‚Äôt even left reception. I tried to complain about her but nobody answered calls and when the concierge called back they said they weren‚Äôt responsible for the front desk.    Some more issues included:    - Every other slot machine is broken the ones that work don‚Äôt fully work so no sound etc  - The elevator broke on our trip up to the room and opened half way between a floor. It was horrific as it dropped from floor 12 to 10 before the brakes kicked in  - There is only 1 pool you can use unless you want to pay $300 for a bed in one of the other pools  - loads of rubbish under all the pool beds. Poolside doesn‚Äôt seem to ever get cleaned  - Construction means taxi queue is really far away    Overall I think this hotel needs to be knocked down or a serious lot of investment. The only investment seems to be going into the main lobby to make it look better. I don‚Äôt think that will help.    The staff act like they are doing you a favour allowing you to stay at their hotel and you‚Äôre simply a number and massive inconvenience to them.    I‚Äôve stayed at so many hotels now on the strip and even the cheaper options are now better than Caesar‚Äôs so for cheap go to Bally‚Äôs or planet Hollywood but for nicer go to bellagio Mandalay bay or Wynn.
40,Took a taxi from the airport. The front of the hotel is under construction so it was a long walk to the lobby with our bags. When we checked in we used the Kiosk instead of waiting in the huge line. Very easy to use and included directions to find our room.  We had pre-booked a king suite in the Augustus Tower. Very nice large room on a private hallway. Had a nice view too. My only issue was we could hear the traffic noise below. We were on the 27th floor so you wouldn't think it would be noisy??  We had planned to order all our meals in the room using their app but it didn't work on the first night and no one could help us. I finally got it to work the next day. We used it for the rest of the stay ordered from different restaurants. It was fast and the food was always hot. **Note neither of the Gordan Ramsey restaurants were ever available on the app and you couldn't get a reservation there either.  All food and drinks through out the place are super pricey.  We spent 2 days at the pool both days I pre-reserved a cabana daybed online.  The walk to get to the pool area was like a mile! All of the entrances are closed and you have to walk to the 1 entrance that's open. Only 1 or 2 pools are open each day and only the Temple pool was free of charge.  We had fantastic service at the Neptune Pool no crowds because it's all reserved. The water was FREEZING! The 2nd day at the Venus pool was ok but techno music was way too loud. Also beware the pool hours change each day.    The Casino was too smokey for me but we really only stayed there for the Keith Urban concert at the Coliseum which was fabulous!  The hotel elevators are not secure you could walk in off the street and go to any floor. They should at least have a card key access for safety.
10,I stayed in early August and had bed bugs in my room. I reported the incident to the only email address available on their website and they returned my email 14 days later with a phone call telling me I had to call a different department within the company to report the incident. Why not just have the Risk department call me directly? Insanity. Will never stay there again (not that I would have considered it anyway) but their customer service is trash.
40,Overall the stay was good. The room was clean and the staff was friendly. It was a major inconvenience to have to walk so far to check into the hotel and then not to mention how far you have to walk to get to your room. When you leave the walk is even farther to catch a cab to the airport. This will cause me to not stay at this property again however if you don't mind the walk and dragging your luggage a country mile it's a nice property. My parting comment is that the resort fee is crazy - for the most part all you are getting is wifi and access to the fitness center.
10,We were robbed. Inside job. Unike other hotels no security in elevator lobby. Do not stay there. Lost laptops ipads medicine jewelry. We knew the limited itme window - you would think they had cameras.
30,The rooms are clean and nice compared to other hotels on the strip. There is a large variety of entertainment bars and restaurants within the complex that are of high quality.    My unhappiness lies with the entire check-in process. The line was extremely long and slow  moving. We reserved a king room and checked in early online after arriving at the hotel we were informed they over sold king rooms and there were none available. Plus the customer service agent was very rude about it. We wouldn‚Äôt have stayed at Cesars if there wasn‚Äôt a king available.    We joked while waiting in line that everyone was super mad at the desks it makes more sense now because Cesars doesn‚Äôt honor the original reservation made!
50,At the front desk Omar went above and beyond helping me out tonight. It was a terrible day and issues came up but Omar kept his cool even when I didn‚Äôt and handled the situation perfectly. I couldn‚Äôt be more thankful for everything he did.
40,Hotel was nice. a bit to big that I got lost a few times. directions were not to clear to follow. also their was construction going on 24 hrs a day. and at night it was to loud that I was not able to sleep.
50,We are staying for a work trip and are very happy with Caesars! I read reviews and was a little worried but so far everything has been great! People are friendly and helpful! Staying in palace towers and room is very nice and clean. Would stay again!
50,It was an amazing experience in this resort everything was wonderful exceed my expectations and my mom love it!!!! Thanks for everything! I would have liked to have been longer to enjoy all the resort but see you next time
30,Lots of construction which I was unaware. No Taxi stand in front so had to walk around the garden to get a taxi. Could be difficult for physically challenged without a wheelchair. Didn't mind the detours and hard hats around but a jack hammer starting up at 6 a.m. every morning was not a wake-up call I wanted. I did not complain to anyone but they should not start up that loud noise until at least 7:30 am
40,Recently renovated and perfectly located on the Las Vegas strip. This place is massive so be sure to pack your walking shoes and plenty of patience. The entire property is a work of art and worthy of lots of photos. The casino area still smells like an ashtray so if you can avoid it you will be better off. The rooms are a very nice size and come with plenty of amenities. Restaurants Shops an awesome pool and an incredible theater. Give it a try!
30,I paid more for a room based on the direct Caesar‚Äôs Palace website only to learn the room doesn‚Äôt actually exist! Completely stumped the front desk mngr made their mistake right by refunding the difference.
10,My wife and I stayed at Caesar Palace one recent weekend to attend her class reunion at the Mandalay Bay which was the official venue of the reunion. Despite the convenience of staying there we opted to stay at the Caesar's Palace(now undergoing renovations) a decision that we would regret! First the valet parking is accorded only to the high and mighty: 7 Star members . Thus you have to self park and endure more than a mile walk from the garage carrying all your baggage to your designated Tower. If you wish to take a taxi from the hotel prepare to walk another mile from your room to the designated taxi stand. If enduring all these long walks is enough wait till you get to the elevators at the Octavius Tower where we were billeted. That weekend when we stayed there was only a couple of elevators working!!! When we checked out on Saturday only one elevator was working!!!!! It took us a good 45 minutes to get off our floor. Many guests were grumbling that they had to wait over an hour just to get off their floors. I wonder how many more poor souls were aggravated by this horrible situation. Caesar's Palace boasts of its size and grandeur. To have only one working elevator at the Octavius Tower at the height of check in/check out day is the ultimate in insensitivity and incompetence!!!! After the tiresome walk from the hotel to the self parking garage awaited the coup de grace: a $72 parking fee!!!! Caesar's Palace ? Never again!!!!
10,WE purchased a ticket AT the ticket booth at the Hotel. Paid cash ti (Latoya) the ticket agent who had actually sold us a bogus ticket. Isn't that clearly fraud? When we told the hotel security they actually did nothing!! They didn't investigate it at all I guess they deal with so much fraud that they don't care if it happens right in their hotel. I was dumbfounded! I would never stay there again. It is simply not safe!
20,Reserved one night stay at Caesar's Palace Las Vegas Nevada for my niece's wedding. The reservationist and when checking in at the desk I expressed my concern about handicap access for my 90 year old mother. No one prepared me for the walking distance from the entrance of the hotel to the hotel room or the distance from the room to the wedding venue. My mother uses a rollator walker with seat and wheels we had to rest serval time before reaching our room. The walking was just too much for her. There were no noticeable signage in the casino that gave directions for anyone using a walker or wheelchair. We were stuck at one point on a upper level that required going down stairs. We called for security to open the lift that was available to lower Mom down when security arrived to unlock the lift door the lock was inoperable. Security helped carry her walker down the stairs while my Mom walked carefully down one step-at-a-time. She was so exhausted when we got to our room that she could no longer walk the distance to attend her granddaughter's wedding. We stayed in the room and went to bed. This experience showed me that we can not plan stays or even a visit at a large resort hotel casino without explicit handicap assistance. Clear ADA signage and welcoming compassionate personal to assist is a must for elderly seniors with limitations.
20,For an upgraded room we were recipients of: a Keurig machine with coffee that cost $20 (even Holiday Inn offers free coffee!) a clogged sink bath jets didn‚Äôt work and worst of all construction (i.e jackhammering and backup beeping from equipment) sometime in the middle of the night for hours for two nights straight. No warnings at all and not even earplugs or sound machine could save us. What was once one the best pools on the strip now functions on a caste system and the photos on the website are out of date. The upselling is over the top. Signed up for Rewards and didn‚Äôt get ‚Äúfree‚Äù slots credits that were promised. I realize it is Vegas but wasn‚Äôt a great experience. Needless to say we will not stay at Caesar‚Äôs again. On a positive note the room was generally nice and the employees seemed friendly.
20,Most of the visit was fine but I have 2 complaints.    #1 they messed something up in their system and both of our keys stopped working the day before we were checking out. We called the hotel for help and they routed us to the security department. Security was incredibly rude told us they were too busy with other problems and hung up on us. We called back same rude treatment they told us to ‚Äújust be patient‚Äù and hung up on us again. I made the 5 minute walk to the front desk. The line was long so I walked to the front and asked for a supervisor. Same rude treatment. Told me they were busy and I‚Äôd have to be patient. I explained to them that we were going to miss our dinner reservation at this point and they could not care less. Finally got me new keys to the room told me it was my fault for putting the key next to a credit card in my wallet and did not even apologize. Very dissapointed and upset!    #2 guests of the hotel are supposed to get free parking. The system did not work properly and we had to ‚Äúcall for assistance‚Äù every time we left the garage.
20,Disappointing from the get go. Was not aware hotel was under renovations at the entrance and lobby hard to navigate. Then our room was not the ‚ÄúStrip View‚Äù we purchased when I asked about it I was told ‚Äúviews are not guaranteed‚Äù - so why advertise and charge extra for ‚Äústrip view‚Äù! Called Concierge to make some reservations got an operator and was told ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt do that it‚Äôs online only due to Covid‚Äù What?? Caesar‚Äôs Palace used to be something special now just a heartless corporation üò¢ and definitely not worth the price.
40,Our room was fantastic! Beautiful view very spacious his and her bathrooms and that shower-wow!  We had a lovely-albeit expensive-dinner at Joe‚Äôs stone crab one night. Dinner was delicious and our server was exceptional. Great recommendations very attentive and helpful but not intrusive.  My only complaint is about the pool. First of all the pool closes at 6:00 pm. Makes no sense. We planned one evening with no dinner plans so we could laze by the pool that evening but weren‚Äôt able to because it closed so early. Beyond that they try to run you out at 5:30! They start blowing a whistle and walking around telling you it‚Äôs closing time and they need everyone out. I only had my feet in and he told me I had to get out. Ridiculous. Do you close at 6:00 or 5:30??? As if that‚Äôs not bad enough at 4:30 or 5 staff starts walking around slamming the chairs into flat position. So much for relaxing!  It‚Äôs a beautiful hotel but I will probably not stay here again because we do enjoy after dinner swims.
40,I would definitely stay here again! This was my first time staying at Caesars a week or so before my trip I was offered an upgrade to the forum tower room I had originally booked I got upgraded to the palace tower and boy did it not disappoint! We had his and her bathrooms a great shower and the bed was dreamy! On top of this we had an amazing housekeeper who we requested for our entire stay! She was great replaced our towels daily tidied up only what was needed and came at the same time everyday (like she knew what time we‚Äôd be heading out at) the Venus pool cabana daybed was amazing and the staff was great! The only negative would be the bartenders at the sports book; I stood around waiting for a while and was completely ignored I ended up leaving and going elsewhere! The biggest and only complaint I have is the lack of security in regards to guest elevators not once was I asked for my card to ensure I was truly a guest at the location which after staying at the Venetian was a bit of a shock! All in all it was a great trip and stay at this location! Can‚Äôt beat the location on the strip either conveniently located in the center of the strip!
30,I expected to feel like an Empress i was dissappointmented. Stayed in the executive suite room ambience dark and sad.  The front desk did not give me a receipt of what i paid. When i called to ask  i was told that i can actually access my receipt on the hotel  Television not the answer i was actually expecting to hear..  professionally and as a high end las vegas hotel  I expected to hear from hotel guest service‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI apologize Let me be of assistance to you how may I help you?
50,We were in town for the MINExpo at the convention center. We were very close to the monorail and enjoyed that convenience. We loved the rooms and the restaurants were amazing. We enjoyed the spa for a day and the pool each day. Super place to stay in the perfect location in Vegas.
40,Everything was pretty good - except for the construction! It was difficult enough to get into the property but to get a taxi you had to go out to Las Vegas blvd.! Do they really expect people to schlep their luggage out there? Never mind negotiating dangerous on property traffic. And what about wheel chairs or older guests? If cabs can come in to drop off  they should be able to pick up as well
40,The hotel itself is very clean huge and has a lot of stuff that you can do. That's the main reason that we decided to stay in Caesars Palace this visit. However the rooms themselves were nothing special.
30,Package was for King room in Forum Tower. Very disappointed. Aesthetics were HORRIBLE. Room was old and smelled stale. Drapery buttons did not work. Toilet barely flushed and the furniture was DISGUSTING. Coffee maker disgusting! I was thoroughly disappointed
20,Self service check in was horrible hire some people and do it right! In my room no coffee maker unless you're willing to pay $20 for 4 Kuerig's and the fridge is locked so you can't put any leftover food or water in it you open it for anything you pay it doesn't feel like they treat you as quests but prey to get your money!! The parking for self park is bad you can't get out using your room key even though that's what they tell you to do. I had to call every time i went out and then you wait while cars are backing up behind you. The worst place to stay never again would rather stay at Motel 6 with no hassles.
20,We have been visiting Las Vegas for several years and generally visit two to three times per year. This was our fist time staying at Caesar‚Äôs Palace and it will definitely be our last. First there is major construction going on and the resort did not provide any warning prior to our arrival. The construction has moved the valet area to the opposite side of the property from the front desk so prepare for a marathon with your luggage. We met our friends at the pool and discovered the water is freezing. I appreciate a cool pool when the outside temperature is over 100 but everyone in our group could not tolerate staying in the water more than a few minutes. Walking around the pool deck I overheard a lot of other guests discussing the cold water temperature. Also the menu and drink selection at the pool is extremely limited. I asked the cocktail waitress for a coffee and was told it is not served at the pool. She apologized and provided me directions to a cafe inside where I could get coffee for the group at the pool. I tried to follow her directions but other pool staff said the doors I was directed to use were off limits and I had to walk around the entire pool complex to get somewhere for a cup of coffee. The bars inside the hotel and on the casino floor are grossly understaffed. Three of us waited at the bar between Rao‚Äôs and Giada‚Äôs for 40 minutes and the single bartender never acknowledged us. We gave up and walked to the gift shop near the front desk to buy beer. We did a quick breakfast at the food court one morning and somehow they managed to burn the pre-made breakfast sandwiches in their microwave. Dinner at Hell‚Äôs Kitchen was also a let down.    The only reason for two stars: the room was clean and the housekeeping staff on the 10th floor of the Palace tower were so pleasant and friendly.    Back to MGM or Sands properties for us; Caesar‚Äôs was extremely disappointing.
10,Nobody told us that if we opened the refrigerator and see what its in there we would have an additional charge and one of us didn‚Äôt know how to read English so that persons did it we tried to talk with a supervisor and they said that the hotel staff had to explain that when we did the check in but wasn‚Äôt true nobody explained that! And we tried to use the pool but was closed and nobody told us‚Ä¶  Worst experience in my life I don‚Äôt recommend to visit this hotel
10,"Our hotel was broken into and all bags were stolen. We had 5 guests with two connecting suites and were told that the best they could do was give us $250 (not each but total) that could go towards the hotel and food....    I'm aware these break ins can happen but the response from Caesar's management was unexpected unprofessional and insulting. Nothing was offered to make our experience more positive and enjoyable. Nothing done to make us feel safe. We literally had everything taken from our hotel room even our toiletries. When we told the hotel they gave us a hand full of plastic bags with the bare minimum of toiletry items inside. Not even a decent bag but the plastic bags you put your produce in at the grocery store!    Worst Vegas experience ever! Caesar's lack of response and efforts show that they don't care about their guest's safety and security. ..Even the police who filed our report said that Caesar's known to have the worst camera systems and ""dirty workers""."
30,Customer service was average. Very surprising! Out of 9 times to Vegas this was first at Caesar‚Äôs. The Bell desk never offered to bring our bags to or from room. No maid service or fresh towels in my 2 night stay. Not a great experience for the money.Check in and check out was very easy. The room was nice.
30,Coffee is not complimentary. Bring your K Cups - because they‚Äôre $20 from your in room the coffee bar. Octavius tower - beautiful room comfy luxurious everything & no coffee!? For $400 per night highly disappointed w/ this corporate decision.
10,I would absolutely would not recommend staying at Caesar‚Äôs Palace. This is a casino and not a ‚Äòtypical‚Äô hotel. There are long lines to check in and express check in. There are long walks required to get to and from your room. Luggage has to be dragged through smoked filled casinos to get to your room. No bellhops or carts available to use. Long walks to taxis and Ubers. Caesar‚Äôs is overpriced and we did not get what we paid for. It was also very over crowded. Many people frequent hotel just to gamble.
20,I actually enjoyed my stay at Caesars palace I stayed in the Julius Room. Beautiful Pool! Location is right in the heart of the strip. Awesome Bed and Pillows.    As for my Nightmare situation...I checked out on 9/9/2021 11:00 am. look at my CC got a couple of 108.00 charges that were pending and figured it was a hold. The next day (friday) I look at my CC and there is a 583.10 charge on my CC... figured it was a hold... Well monday the 108 dropped but the 583.10 posted! I called billing and they asked my if I was at a sportsbook on 9/9/21 at night. I said no they said my room was charged at 9/9/2021 at 9:03 PM. I was already home in Cali at this time.. Now they have to do an Investigation and get the signed receipt. I do not understand how I can be charged after I checked out of the hotel. This is Crazy and doesn't make any sense. PLEASE turn off your Room Billing if possible. This is a nightmare
50,We loved our stay at Octavius Tower during labour day weekend. We really loved the room (premium room) that we had booked. We stayed there for 2 days and moved to Bellagio for a day. Our room at Caesars was much much better than Bellagio's. Also the pool is much fun (better) at Caesars than Bellagio. Overall the stay was excellent.    One complaint I have is that the check-in is too late for Caesars (4 PM) which can mess up the plans for the day since you can't even use the pool that day properly. This is different than normal check-in (3 PM) for other hotels. There is a fee of 75$ (+ taxes) for early check-in (even 1 hour earlier).
10,I would not recommend staying at the Caesars Palace Hotel. Save yourself some money and frustration and stay somewhere else. I did not have a great experience for multiple different reasons that I won't get into.
40,Nice hotel was clean staff friendly and awesome facilities and location. Was disappointed when we specifically booked a room with 1 king bed for our honeymoon in advance only to show up and be told they had sold out and was given a room with 2 queens instead and no apology or option for a credit or upgrade offered. The hotel was beautiful but for the money spent it was underwhelming.
50,The hotel is really beautiful and the pools are extraordinary. I was at Caesar's for nine nights so I saw it all good and bad. I found the staff to be very accommodating and helpful. I called housekeeping for several items and they came very fast; and the people who showed up at my door were very pleasant. I did have a room in the Forum tower which was not renovated but it was very quiet. Not perfect but a few dings on the furniture is no big deal to me. The bathroom was very big and beautiful. The bed was a bit too soft for my liking but I dealt with it. So for the room alone; I give Caesar's five stars cause I was very comfortable and slept well. But it certainly was not a luxurious room at all.  The pools are all reservation only except the main pool which got so crowded on weekends that I had to leave cause I could not socially distance myself enough. The water was very cold but refreshing in 108 degree heat. I was very annoyed that they allowed cigar smoking inside the pool at 10am which was disgusting. The staff at the pool was also very nice and I really enjoyed the pool experience.  I did not use the casino but no mask enforcement even though signs were posted EVERYWHERE. It was crowded and reeked of smoke. People were vaping indoors and smoking everything imaginable. At times I felt sick from the smells.  They do nickel and dime you for everything. Be very careful cause if you simply move something in the mini bar that will cost you $95 restocking fee. And although there is a coffee machine no coffee is provided. This place is just the definition of greed. But it's Vegas so it's to be expected. The restaurants are all overpriced and so is the food court which wasn't even that good. A pizza slice was $8. And the early-check in fee of $40 is just pure greed seeing that many people are arriving tired and weary. Tip: keep checking as your room may be ready sooner.  The only thing that I was super annoyed about was the lack of masks and enforcement since it was so crowded in the casino. Signs everywhere but people were pretty much free do whatever the heck they wanted. My sister-in-law stayed at the Mirage and she said they were enforcing masks and everyone was wearing them. I suppose all the freedom-seekers came to Caser's knowing they could get away maskless.  All in all even with these inconveniences I had a very pleasant stay. Just wish that they had taken this pandemic more seriously and enforced the masks. I can deal with everything else but my safety is most important. However I would stay again as I expect some of these inconveniences as being a part of what Vegas is.
20,Pros - nice view big bathroom with jacuzzi tub a lot to do on the main floor    Cons - they nickel and dime you to death.. $40 to get in room 2 hrs early.. Keurig in room but if you want coffee cream & ugar it is $20 for the kit. No space in fridge + not permitted to use it. Water bottles are $7 no cups in room to get tap water. No microwave. Pringle shown $13 you get the jdea.    I called customer service bc we paid $597/night and it is really juat a basic room. She was apologetic but could not provide coffee or a cooler to use. This was very disappointing.
30,There were dirty wet towel in the closet and the carpet was wet  The mattress was too soft and not comfortable at all.  We did not sleep well and could not get rested  so we checked out a day earlier because of these problems.
30,Check in on a Wednesday Night was very long and slow moving. After receiving keys proceeded to the Octavius tower which was very far away from the registration area. Upon arriving at the hotel door neither key worked and as a solo traveler I had to lug several suitcases all the way back down to reception. When I told the same staff member what happened he said Ah I'll make you new keys. I of course was skeptical that they would work as I would have been extremely upset if i had to make the trip antoher 2 times. He then said no these are new keys. This implies that the keys he gave me were re-used keys which means there's likely a problem with re-key'ing the old keys that he is aware of. I also asked if there was a closer room because I didn't trust the re-keying process and the staff member made a face and just walked away and said the keys were fine.    The room itself was nice and relatively clean. Outdated for sure compared to Cosmo Wynn Encore Resorts etc but nice. One of the Bathroom Glass cups was chipped and had a huge crack good thing I spotted it before using it because it was really sharp. Also there were no tissues in the tissue box holder and no soap (body wash hand soap etc). Only Shampoo and conditioner.
10,If you enjoy time at the pool this is not the hotel for you. The pool is not heated and the water is ice cold. The food menu at the pool is abysmal. Two of the three pools have admission fees. Very disappointed.
20,We were incredibly disappointed with our stay at Caesar's. From arrival until departure our room smelled horrendous. The room smelled of cigarette smoke poorly cooked meat and musk/mildew. Room service graciously came to deodorize the room three or four times but the smell still lingered throughout our stay. Not to mention this occurred in our ~premium~ suite.    It was nice to sit at the pool and enjoy the water and poolside service in the morning before it got too scorching and in the afternoon shade.    We could not bring ourselves to spend anytime gambling on the property because of the all-encompassing cigarette smoke. Instead we lost money at the Park MGM the Strip's only smoke-free casino. We loved everything about our trip outside of our room and gambling experience at Caesar's so while we do not know where we will stay next time we do know that we will not be staying at Caesar's.    The service we received at Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grub on the other hand was great!
20,During my visit I stayed in the Forum Towers Room 6020. I was disappointed in the overall experience. The furniture is dated worn and in disrepair. The carpet is highly stained and in need of a deep cleaning or replacement. It is clear that the room was not thoroughly cleaned as there were dust balls and water stain buildup on the shower doors. The shower did not drain properly with water pooling horribly. We had to call maintenance twice. Even the telephone worked poorly and was missing the chord. The only saving grace was the bed. It was comfortable and slept well. The room I stayed in was not very ‚Äúpalace‚Äù-like.
30,Lots of construction inconvenient for getting around. Our room in the premier Augustus tower had a great fountain/strip view but was long overdue for a total remodel. Bellman @ valet luggage drop was argumentative about not assuring the bags would arrive intact because we had two boxes. Odd & sure enough one of our bags was not delivered to the room. It was later found by bell staff (untagged by original bellman).
10,I pre-paid for my stay at Caesars Palace. They stated rooms Wil be ready by 4pm on day of check in. I arrived at 6pm and my room was not ready. I was then bumped to a lower tier room for the same price. When I walked into the room there was trash the phone did not work the lamps were broken and the shower did not drain properly. You would think a hotel that costs 200-300 a night would have these items taken care of. The workers did not care and would not listen to what I experienced. For this price go somewhere else. This place is not worth your time and money. I reached out to them about my experience and never heard back.
20,The room and the resort is beautiful very clean and well appointed. We stayed in the Palace Tower and I have no complaints about the service cleanliness or quality of the resort itself. My issue is with all the additional fees and charges that you incur when you are already paying a premium for the room. We paid over $700 per night for the room    There was a Keurig machine in the room but no coffee I called and asked if they forget to leave it in the room they told me there is some in the minibar for a small $22 fee - really?? We went to starbucks I have never stayed at a hotel they didn't provide coffee in the room - maybe my expectations are too high. Then there is the $50 a night resort fee ok we can live with this. However for the WIFI in the room they only allow 2 devices if you have more than 2 devices you are paying for WIFI.  There is an additional $15 per device per day for WIFI service -What!! My Husband has a laptop and mobile phone and so do I so we are paying another $30 a night for WIFI. Oh yeah and you better bring your own water it is $14 a bottle for water from the minibar. If you are drinking at the pool you can buy 12 beer for the discount price of $102. Anyone of these things might be okay but it seemed like everytimee you turn around there is another charge and another fee.    Not worth all the extra costs.
20,This hotel needs a serious deep cleaning and remodel. Our room was spacious but outdated. Lacking decor carpet was very old with visible areas of tear. The smoke around the lobby and casino was unbearable. The restaurants were good and drinks at vanderpump garden bar were good too. Overall the Strip is dirty  so much homelessness is heartbreaking. Something major needs to be done to improve the experience and quality of life of their residents.
40,We stayed in the Palace Tower for an extended Labor Day weekend. Our room was great and appeared to have been thoroughly cleaned. The dressing table with makeup mirror was really a plus. The reason I didn't give a five-star review was that the casino was extremely smokey (despite the no smoking regulation which is not enforced). Because I have a breathing issue this was really a problem for me. If for any reason you have a condition that makes walking long distances a problem I would suggest a smaller hotel. It's quite a hike from the lobby to anywhere else on the property.
10,"The customer service here is non existent and they're blaming everything on covid - then stay closed! Caesars Palace is taking people's money and offering extremely sub standard piss poor customer service even for a $4000 reservation. Problems: booking - they will not connect you to speak with someone directly on the property every call is routed to call centers even if you request a call back from the property. My issues were not addressed until after I emailed two complaints to the corporate office. Concert tickets - I had problems with booking my concert tickets and ended up having to pay more than double due to the lack of customer service. Check-in - I was sent an email to ease the check in process and asked if I wanted an early check in - I answered yes for a 2pm check in and was willing to pay the early check in fee All of that was a waste of time - my suite was NOT ready at check in time - 4pm didn't get in until 6pm and the adjoining room was not still not ready - they had to give a $200 credit since they were so late. Service - ridiculous - room keys didn't work - they make everyone stand in the same long line for everything no shorter line for guests already checked in with minor issues (keys room charges etc.) nope you have to wait in the 20-45 minute line for everything! The room itself Caesars needs to be ashamed for what they are charging and the condition of the rooms - I booked the 2-bedroom duplex forum tower suite with an additional adjoining room for over $4000 for the weekend. These suites are in SERIOUS NEED OF UPGRADING!! The room was spacious - that's the only compliment it ends there. Oh my goodness on the rest -the furniture is worn and stained the technology has to be from the 90's (no bluetooth anywhere the existing speaker system worked when it felt like it the remotes control tvs in different rooms there is absolutely NO streaming (netflix hulu etc) the ""wet bar"" is an old refrigerator in an undecorated room with a tiny sink the downstairs bathroom faucet leaked and our ""view"" was nonexistent - a beige building. Four of the six elevators broke down causing long wait times. And to top it all off the slot machines were just collecting money - my largest ""win"" was $2.25 - for real. I work too hard for my money to spend it here ever again. You've been warned...book at your own risk!!"
10,So that room itself it very nice. But they charge the $50 /day resort fee. My initial room had two double beds and a shower. I am there with my husband. We went and requested a king bed.. the upgrade was $39 more. Therefore I ended up paying $89 more a day more than original price. The drinks and food are outrageous! $30 for margarita pool side! 8.50-11.00 for domestic beer in the casino. $15 for mixed drink like jack and coke....I mean Pepsi there is no coke at any of the casinos. All of the restaurants are high end expect to spend at least $40 per plate. Ar one restaurant we had a breakfast burrito for $20. We ask for tabasco and they said that will be $2! The food court which should be better is expensive too. A pepperoni pizza is $45!!!. Burger $16. Bagel $6. While gambling I only had a waitress TWICE in 4 days cone and offer a drink. And do not even TOUCH the snacks or mini bar or you will be charged. I have been to Vegas many times. Other casinos have reasonable places to eat in the casino along with the high end restaurants. I had to go to another casino to eat and drink. I will NEVER go back to Caesar palace.
10,"When I arrived I had to wait in line for about 40 minutes to check in as they only had 3 and sometimes 2 people manning th desk. When I finally got to check in they charged me $40.00 ""Early Check in Fee"" although I arrived at 1.50pm and the room was ready. They said I could wait till 4.00pm and not pay it which was the last thing I wanted to do after flying for 4 hours to get there. I feel this was a total con and rip off and will not be staying there again."
10,My husband and I have been frequent visitors to the strip for over 30 years. We usually stay at NY NY but decided to try Caesars this time expecting it to be a step above. It was an absolute disappointment. Our room was in the Forum tower.    The room was dark and drab. We stayed 3 nights and our room was never cleaned or made up even though the service please light was on the whole time. The furniture was old and damaged. The frame on the ‚Äúartwork‚Äù was broken and the phone in the bathroom was so gross and dirty why is there still a phone in the bathroom in 2021?The following were other items that didn‚Äôt work at all:    1. Clock  2. Bedside lamp  3. Drapery open and close controls  4. In mirror television    The property is under construction and very dirty. We booked our adult kids into Harrahs at exactly half the cost. Their rooms were much nicer and cleaner and everything worked. We also noticed the service at Harrahs was much better than at Caesars.    We will never stay here again. For the prices Caesars is charging not only for their rooms but in their restaurants service and cleanliness were really lacking.
10,I really don‚Äôt wanna sound like a ‚Äúkaren‚Äù but this previous stay at Caesars was terrible. Took 3 calls to the front desk to get someone to clean our disgusting room. Trash was in the shower lamps were gross and dusty the phone was caked with dirt and dust the glass window in the room was finger printed and looked like someone got chocolate or candy on the window the bathtub was full of hair lightbulbs were out in the bathroom. A housekeeper finally came to our room and cleaned only a couple things. We had to call again because they missed stuff again!! The. The inconvenience of the maintenance person knocking on our door because the AC unit to the room next to us was leaking water. He checked our AC in our room and it looked like the filter wasn‚Äôt changed in years! On our last day there the housekeeper tried barging in our room. She gave me so much attitude. Tried saying i needed to pay for late check out when i already contacted the front desk the night before to get late check out. Also noticed that the lobby wreaks of cigarettes. I think they stopped pumping perfume through the hotel. The worst part about this visit honestly was that the front desk didn‚Äôt seem to care about our room problems. Asked to change rooms and they wouldn‚Äôt let us. Only wanted to gives us a measly food credit. I don‚Äôt think i will return to this hotel.
50,The whole stay from arrival to departure was superb. We visit Vegas frequently it was our first time to stay at Ceasars palace I was 100% satisfied and it will be our only place to stay in the future
10,"I booked this hotel for 2 nights and booked 5 days ahead of time. No where in my booking process was it stated that I had to be 21 years old to check in. I'm 19 and they had all of my information yet they allowed me to book. After driving 6 hours to the hotel I was told I couldn't check in because of my age and I responded with ""that's f***ing ridiculous"" and the check in lady viewed that as a threat so I was escorted out by a possy of security guards. I have yet to get a refund because Ceasars palace claims I was a ""no show"" when in reality they denied my check in"
10,First of all I booked this trip 6 months in advance and requested adjoining rooms but they couldn't accommodate me upon arrival; couldn't use the speed check in kiosk because someone misspelled my name when I booked the rooms stood in line for 50min to be told we couldn't check in until 4p then 18min later after we went to eat to kill time our rooms were ready no where near each other I might add; then was told to get keys at the kiosk NOT!!! after 10 attempts the supervisor telling me try on more time she finally had to key the cards the old fashion way and only gave me 4 when we had a party of 5 so we had to stay in pairs to access the rooms; I realize Caesars is old but they are just putting a bandaid on the rooms because the wood was falling off the cabinets in both bathrooms we had a hole in our wall by the bed they tried to charge me $75 for each room for opening the fridge door because we assumed such an expensive room would have a mini bar/fridge/microwave NOT SO!!! And yes they have sensors on the fridge door and you get charged a fee if you try to put your food in the fridge your paying the room to be in! The place is just too big you literally have to hike to get to anything which is my fault for booking w/them to begin with I figured go big or go home for my 50th Bday weekend w/my girls. Lesson learned Now lets talk about Crystal with the gray hair at the pool who is a manager who felt the need to tell us 3 times to remove something from the pool area and after doing so never saw her or our waitress Rylee again. how convenient. The construction sucked as well.
10,"I arrived on Sept 4th and it's really busy due to Labor Day long weekend. Everything seems fine. I got early the next day the 5th; the metal part of the bed frame sticks out and I almost cut my self open. I called the lobby and told them my room number (1625) to report and discuss the issue. The only thing that receptionist ask me was did you cut yourself or are you bleeding? And I said no. Then she told me she will transfer me to the security. The security asked the same question. And I reported with the security. The security told me the ""manager will contact me via my phone number regarding the issue"" I waited the whole evening and didn't receive any phone calls from the hotel. I ended up heading to the lobby. I told the girl at the lobby. And she went inside to grab the manager. I told the manager what the issue was. And the manager was so helpless. He asked me did I cut myself. I said no. I asked him are you going to wait until I cut myself or someone hurt himself/herself to react to it? His response was ""Thank you for letting me know"" He said that the metal part only stick out a bit if it's stick out more than that he would concern about it. I told him this is out first time staying at Caesars and we are not really happy about this issue. His response was because of this metal thing that make you are not happy? I was speechless after I heard that. And then he ask ""is there anything else I can do for you"" I said nope. And he repeated ""thank you for letting him know"".  I walked away and was like wow. What kind of customer service is this. During my stay the issue or the problem was not fixed. Not even single person came up to the room and tried to fix the bed frame.  I might be unlucky that I got that room but the customer service should be better and live up to the standard.  I'm in the customer service industry so I've always told my employees ""treat our customers like we want to be treated""  Caesars Palace Customer Service is Exceptionally Unacceptable. If I'm allowed to give ""zero"" star for the customer service department. I certainly will.    Thank you  King"
20,The Hotel don't public the list of the cost services or item in the mini bar I recommend  No touch the mini bar or item abode the mini bar they charge you $75 for recharger only.  Also $27 for see a free TV
40,"Check in was a bit of a frustrating process as I was told to use the ""express kiosk"" but it was not functioning properly...Once that was settled I couldn't have picked a better property. Our room was clean beautiful and very comfortable. The food options are lovely and the pool grounds exceeded my expectations!! I will definitely return and hope check in will not take almost 2 hours next time!"
30,Room had a constant running toilet. Carpet needed stretched. Big trip Hazzard in middle of room. Only got housekeeping the 1st day of 5. No one showed up other days. Rewards program. I got like 3 different ways on how the program worked. Long hold times calling front desk. Rooms were dated but bigger than avg hotel.
30,"We stayed here on two different weekends in August/September. Both times in the Palace Tower. Both times express check-in did not work for us (once it couldn't read my license the second time it just jammed and rebooted). Wifi does not stay connected and the higher up you are the less your LTE works. Frustrating.    Once you get past the fact that you're a number to them and not a name you're fine. No personal service. No one cared that no one is wearing masks. (Contrast that to the Bellagio where they have people stationed at the elevators to enforce the masks and walking the casino to tell people to put them on!) We got no room cleaning at all the first stay had to call twice for towels. Got room cleaned once on the second stay and a mysterious bag of towels left at our door. I understand they are likely short-staffed but it would be nice to know I'd not get the room cleaned or towels without asking for them.    I had a package sent to me there and it took an act of congress to find it. Check-in agent said to check with ""bell desk"". There isn't one. So I followed signs to Concierge only to find there isn't one of those either. Finally a nice guy at one of the members clubs gave me the phone number of the package center.    Both rooms in Palace Tower were fine. Both overlooked the pool area. Beds were comfortable and massive bathroom with double sink made it easy to get ready to go out.    I was only here for shows at the Colosseum. I likely won't return."
40,We checked in at the express checking. The service there is pretty basic. Employees pretended we knew it all and with the app they offer with a map they think they solve all questions. The Problem was their wifi. It was just super slow. I could not make the app work. We stayed at the Octavius with pool view. In room there was no bath robes. There is a Keurig 1 cup of coffee maker but no amenities for it. No welcome mask and sanitizer kit like the Venetian offered. Overall the room was nice. View was great. We enjoyed our stay:)
10,The room was dirty like never been cleaned.dirty floor .moisture on mini bar.alot of noise in the room due to water leaking .toilet pump broken .there was a bath towel dirty with blood .terrible. Bad cervice
30,Annoyed that I am charged $40/day resort fee ($51.02 w/tax) - and on my mini fridge it states ‚ÄúUse of the refreshment center for personal use will incur a charge of $75‚Äù - meaning I can not put my personal water bottle in the fridge and if I do I‚Äôm charged $75!! - I get the resort fee is to pay for internet (which was extremely slow) parking and pool access - but wanting to charge to just put something in the fridge is annoying. I‚Äôm thinking the hotels are charging fees for whatever they can get away with to make up for lost revenue due to covid. Also MANY people walking around without masks!! They need to train employees to ask people to wear their masks. I saw a valet guy give a ticket to a hotel guest inside the hotel guest did not have mask on and he didn‚Äôt say anything. It would have been a good opportunity for him to say it‚Äôs mandated in NV that masks are to be worn..and show the signs.
10,"Never again will we stay at Caesars. To begin we were naive to the pricing gouging that would occur. Beware the fridge in the room is a money pit! You cannot even remove one item to perhaps store any of your own items. If you do you will be charged a $75 restocking fee! Unreal. Caesars will gouge you at every turn no questions. The property itself is not conducive to anyone who cannot maintain olympic form for walking long distances. Long lines for food services anything and a long ways to walk to get there. the ""upgraded"" room we had was missing a lightbulb a sink didn't drain cold water tap didn't turn properly...no help to fix it. The property is filled with cigarret and marijuana smoke. If you plan to go then plan to leave poor underserved exhausted tired frustrated and smoked out."
10,"I've had some level of preferred status with Caeser's/Total Rewards for 15+ years and stay at their properties several times a year in Vegas. I usually don't stay at Caesar's Palace because it's so sprawling but I booked a comped room into it for Labor Day weekend in Feb.  I went to VIP checkin and I told the desk I'd booked a king in Feb but decided to bring along our kids so I'd be interested in something bigger. I was offered a suite upgrade for a charge and I agreed. I was warned the view wasn't great which I said wasn't a problem as long as the room was large and comfortable and suitable for kids.  Entering the suite I immediately noticed the sagging furniture holes in the walls fraying carpet in the middle of the room gouges in the tabletops. It looked like a frat room from 25 years ago. The bathroom cabinetry drawers were falling off cigarettes' burns into the bathtub unpainted base boards 2"" holes in the bed skirts strange sticky substances under the glass tabletops. sagging coil mattress and some dark and curly hair near the pillows.  I went back to VIP checkin and told them that room was not acceptable especially as a paid upgrade and frankly shouldn't be rented to anyone. Crunchy is not a good adjective to describe carpet.  The woman at the desk told me that tower was the oldest built 50 years ago and some of the rooms weren't the best. I told her no one told me that when they offered me the paid upgrade and I wanted a suitable room. She said there wasn't anything she could do without me spending considerably more money so I requested to speak with the manager.  After about 10 minutes the manager came out. I explained I had booked into a King but requested something bigger at checkin and was offered this suite upgrade for an added nightly charge. I told her this suite does not match the description of a 4 or 5 star property and is well below quality standards. She told me the property has 4000 rooms and some are 50+ years old and have not been upgraded and that was what I was placed in.  She then proceeded to shift the blame for the room quality to me by telling me I shouldn't have booked into the forum tower if I wanted a quality room. I told her it is not common knowledge which of the 5 or 6 different towers and hundreds of room descriptions are the best ones and there should be a minimum quality standard. None of the descriptions say holes in the wall and crunchy carpet.  She gave me an ultimatum go back to the original room I had booked which didn't meet the needs of my trip or pay $400/nt to be put into a better quality suite or she offered/threatened to cancel my reservation and I could leave. This is at 10:30pm on a friday night into a holiday weekend with my wife and 2 kids with me.  I was shocked at how brusque and condescending her attitude was. I immediately contacted mlife (MGM) properties and booked into a comped room at The Park which they offered me a suite upgrade and it was fantastic modern with a great view. I returned to cancel my reservation she refused to speak with me again the man at the desk said he should be able to cancel the reservation but couldn't provide me with documentation it was done and I cancelled my upcoming 5 night trip I had scheduled for October.    By 11:30pm we were checked into The Park after arriving at Caesar's at 9pm.    So my point is BEWARE it is clear they have been cutting services and trying to maximize profits. It was one of the worst interactions with a Vegas hotel in hundreds of trips over the past 2 decades."
30,Our room was not ready at check in time got a text at 4:45 had to go to kiosk to retrieve key had to store our luggage that didn‚Äôt come till 5:30 we almost missed our 7pm show we had to rush to change
50,Love Cesar's Palace since I was a kid. Even in the difficult time of Covid it still a go to stable of where to be when in Vegas. The service is great. Staff is amazing. It is clean and the decor is tasteful for Vegas. I would stay there every time.
50,Stayed in the Palace Tower. Nice view of the strip & Mirage pool. The room seemed somewhat updated. Nice bathroom with great water pressure. The tv seemed small and no coffeemaker bums me out. They do deliver coffee but it was an hour wait. So we went down to Brioche (great pastry btw) and stood with everyone else who wanted coffee. The pool seemed crazy packed so we skipped it. I‚Äôd stay here again.
10,My husband and I were very disappointed with caesars palace. Elevators were broken so getting to and from our room took up to 20 mins. In our room the electronics did not work. House keeping walked in our room twice without knocking. Once on check out day. They walked in before 10am. (checkout is at 11). I couldn‚Äôt find a concierge desk although there was a sign for it.
10,My wife drove in to Vegas for her sister‚Äôs birthday  after arriving at close to midnight for a room that was already paid for the front desk denied my wife access  and had to sleep in the car all because she misplaced her credit card
50,Granted with construction going on inside and out overall our stay was so much fun!! Thankfully to this wonderful lady named Julia at the kiosk she helped us a lot by giving us full detail and guide of our hotel experience! It was so easy to check in at the kiosk no clue why people would want to wait an hour long and check in with a human being.  The room was beautiful pool was pretty cold but still had lots of fun! Came for a getaway trip with some girlfriends. Will definitely be coming back to Caesars!!
10,I was VERY disappointed in this hotel. The property is nice but my room was a dump! I have stayed in 3 star hotels that were nicer than this. The furniture is VERY worn and banged up and the room is dated (velour couch anyone). There is NO bath tub (can't drink champagne in a bubble bath without a tub). Even though most of the hotels in Vegas charge a resort fee 51 dollars is a joke. There is nothing extra for that fee. Save your money and stay at a cheaper hotel along the strip...Caesar's Palace in NOT worth it!
10,Our room had a bed that felt like it was 30 years old or more. It was unusually overly deep puffy and mushy. At night when I went to bed it sank and it pulled me towards the middle. The chairs in the room were also extremely dirty on the arms. We had to place towels over them to use them and the rug felt grimy. We didn‚Äôt initially complain because we were just there to gamble see a concert and sleep. I got into to bed at 12 am and could not sleep in it because it sank and enveloped me. I had to try to sleep on the very edge which was uncomfortable on my shoulder. At 4 am I had enough and called and asked to switch rooms. They said I had to go back to the lobby. I had to get dressed and go down which was an inconvenience because it was not close by. When I arrived I asked for a manager and I spoke with Katy at main front desk. I told her the issues and she said the hotel changes out the beds every month. She flat out lied. There is no way that bed was new. She then said they had no rooms in the Forum tower but they had the same room in the Julius tower but I would have to pay $40 to change or wait until the next day. I advised her that was unacceptable. She said it was policy and the the forum tower was an older tower that needed renovation. She also stated she was giving me a discount which makes no sense because I should have a same quality room. I asked her to ask her supervisor and she said no there was no one to ask because she was the most senior. We went in circles and circles. I said why would you even rent these rooms if they need renovation. She had no response to that question. I kept calm and asked several more times to make an exception. I even agreed to pay half of the fee since I really didn‚Äôt get to use my room. She said no either pay $40 or wait until they have a room in same tower. At this point i was going to pay the $40 but it made no sense to pay for something that should have been a given which was a room with clean furniture and a normal bed for a good nights sleep. Instead of making a bad situation right she made it the WORST experience I have ever had and I travel a lot. I was only able to get 3 hours of sleep and was completely exhausted the next day. It changed my whole experience. Katy was also condescending and rude in her tone and it had to be the worst customer service experience I ever had. Katy should not be in this type of business or she should be retrained on how to deal with customers.
30,WiFi was bad. Could not get any reception. The pool was ICE cold.  Bath tub/ jacuzzi in room- filled up with water when I got out there was sand in our tub. Where did that come from? Wasn‚Äôt me. Dirt/sand from construction going on. Not sure
10,Checking in at Caesars was a nightmare. For $631 per night I reserved two queens. Was told I get a king and your don‚Äôt have a choice. Read the fine print it‚Äôs based on availability even though it‚Äôs booked and paid for. I asked for resort credit. Wasted a half hour with a supervisor who spewed lies and refused to look into the price of a king so I could get refunded the difference. Clerk rolled her eyes at me. I have never had an experience like this and I will never stay at Caesar‚Äôs.
20,The front desk put me in the wrong room and then I had to go back and stand in line again to show them my reservations and then they said MY reservations were wrong! And I was up charge another $50 on TOP of the extra I had already paid per night for a strip view. I was pissed!!!! The staff was rude. I felt UNWELCOME!!! The hotel had major construction which was a huge problem for Uber and Taxi service also. It was just not a good experience at all. Then I was charge almost $70 for mini bar items and I NEVER even open the mini bar!!!
20,"My friends and I were there on a Tuesday morning. There were only a handful of gaming tables open and they were all higher-limits. They've remodeled the once beautifully open spacious casino into cut-up and divided little areas making it very hard to navigate and disappointing with the ""junk food court"" and lowered ceilings. The expansion has made the property almost too big to walk from one end to the other. The internet listing of restaurant opening times were all wrong. The shop hours listed on the internet were all wrong. They weren't offering the fountain show or the Atlantis show. They had a huge crane out front and barriers blocking the beautiful facade. It was very disappointing."
50,We had a great time at this hotel we already planning on going back again in a couple months we definitely recommend we really enjoy staying at this place thank you for making our stay so pleasant ü§óü§óü§óü§ó
20,Don't stay! We've stayed before and had an amazing experience but everything was horrible this go around! The walk from the valet/Uber spot was heinous because of construction the check-in was super long and the check-in people short and snippy we got put into Octavious thinking it was an upgraded room and it was not. The room (5575) was tired chipped furniture horrible bed A/C barely kept up and if you flushed the toilet the sink gurgled ... yeah it was great! NOT    We went to the pool which if you want a chair get there early. If not prepare to pay for a different part of the pool which is absolutely ridiculous. Its taking advantage and for subpar service. I ordered one large margarita for a whopping $45.    Never again! We always stay at the Palazzo/Venetian but it was sold out this time around. Note for next time book earlier than normal. I won't stay at Caesars again it was gross and disgusting.
20,First off I would like to start off with what a complete disappointment we had with our stay. I understand Vegas is meant to be out and all day and night and gamble and the room doesn‚Äôt matter but some people the room does matter and let‚Äôs just say the room we had was not pleasant at all. First impression of our room was what a complete bachelor pad. There was stains on the walls chunks of wood missing out of the edges of all doors and stains throughout all the carpets. For someone who is on vacation and paying to stay in a nice hotel room this was disgusting. The tower we stayed in everyday there was at least two elevators down causing us to have to walk through the stairs until another maid employee told us it‚Äôs always better to us the wing over as the wing we are in is always having problems. This coming from there employee themselves is really disappointing. There solution is to reset the elevator and wait until it happens again. The only thing saving this review from being a one star is the maid service each and everyday who always did a great job and was always friendly on the halls. Now they deserve a huge thank you and they alone have gained my respect. The hotel has fallen completely short of its name and it‚Äôs huge hype from what we have heard.
40,Had an overall nice stay at Caesar‚Äôs Palace! The only issue is the air conditioning which never seems to quite do the job. Room was fantastic otherwise which was a Palace Executive Suite.    Pros:  Pools are always great especially if you have a daybed (see cons too)  Great location  Forum Shops are great from everything from food to shopping    Cons:  Neptune pool now only accessible if you are paying for a pool bed/chair  Were not enforcing mask mandate at the Bacchanal buffet - too many unmasked patrons walking next to and touching food with hands.  Weird placement of master bedroom 42‚Äù television!    Check out absinthe if you haven‚Äôt seen it yet or go again! Just be forewarned if you have no cushion on your chair it‚Äôs going to be 75 mins on a metal chair.
30,We Uber to the hotel from the airport and had to be dropped off always from our hotel .Hotel policy we were exahasted and hot.There was a lot construction going on inside so we were detour different directions and got lost many times. When we got our bill we were over charged for items off the bar we didn‚Äôt eat or drink  so we found out if you pick up the item it‚Äôs consider a charge you need to let your guest know that.
10,I expected a nice hotel with good amenities for the price of a room at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. However the place stinks like cigarette and cigar smoke and the room was very outdated. I could not believe that there was no complimentary coffee provided for guests in the rooms. We spent about an hour at the pool and ordered a bucket of beers and one frozen cocktail and got a bill for $117.00. All of the restaurants were expensive as were the stores. We spent a considerable amount gambling as well and expected to be treated like valuable guests. Instead we felt cheated when we left. I will never return.
30,Bought the basic room. As a Diamond got ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù to Octavius tower. Terrible WiFi the entire trip. Room has seen better days and needs remodeling. Paper thin walls. Rude employees at Sportsbook and buffet. Pool is nice. Managers were helpful when needed.
50,Our room was beautiful with a view of the strip. The staff were awesome and overall the hotel was everything we hoped. The next time we are in Las Vegas we will stay at Caesars Palace for sure. We did not eat at the restaurant Las but the food we could see looked great and everyone said it was worth it.
10,I booked a room with Strip View Room 1 King Non-Smoking . What i got was horrible buildings roofs views and no where to see the strip plus construction inside the casino. The casino blames Expedia and Expedia blames the casino. Beware of what you buy there all crooks.
10,Don‚Äôt stay here. It started with a ripped couch and other damaged furniture. Very disappointed with terrible guest services. No one answered the phone (waited for 10 minutes on the line). We called guest services again and finally got through and was told we couldn‚Äôt have an extra two towels for a shower due to apparent shortages. The water pressure didn‚Äôt even work at all and when maintenance came they pointed out multiple renovations that need to happen including the sink drain not draining. How does a resort put a family up in their rooms that aren‚Äôt taken care of!? Needless to say we cut our two day reservation in half and went to another resort that appreciated our business. Caesars Palace is very disorganized. WE WILL NEVER COME BACK AGAIN!!
10,Non personnel to help assist or clean!  Worst experience ever!  Long rows to check in just 2 persons helping.  Not easy the atm fast check in.  Awful service at front desk.  Not shampoo available or towels! Always had to ask for more.
50,What an amazing place to stay! Everything and everyone was top of the line. We will be coming back soon! The jet tub was amazing after a day of walking. Beautiful rich and clean! We did miss the Greek statues but the Atlantis show was great. Casinos were spotless!
30,Swimming pools matter to me. Looks very Romanesque and pretty but NO UMBRELLAS! You could rent beds with shading but pretty pricey and they run out‚Ä¶Out in the desert it would be impossible to just sit in the sun!  The room was fine the food court a bit tacky but some good restaurants‚Ä¶
20,We stayed at Caesars Palace in August of 2021 and things got off to a bad start right from the moment we checked-in. I initially filled out the early check-in email they sent out so we could drop off our bags and get going. Unfortunately the early check-in machines didn't let us check-in early and we still had to wait in line to talk to an agent at the counter. We eventually got into the room after 5pm that day but still got charged a $45 early check-in fee that they wouldn't remove simply because we filled out that email. Even though we didn't actually check-in early due to something on their end not ours. Then we got to the room and made the mistake of opening the mini bar thinking it was a fridge. We accidentally moved a few items in there as we were taking out an old moldy sandwich that someone else had left and lo and behold Caesar's charged us for all the items that were rattled around in the mini fridge as we were taking out the old sandwich. The entire time we stayed at this place we were uncomfortable and walking on egg shells. I feel like if they could charge you for breathing they would. Our room didn't come with a fridge or a microwave so don't bother bringing back leftovers.
10,Do yourself a favor and stay at the Cosmopolitan or the Bellagio. Customer service sucks the room was dirty. There was dust all over the phone TV and everything. You pay a lot (similar to Cosmo) and don‚Äôt get the treatment!  The way to order food is the worst. The online link doesn‚Äôt work and by phone has to be a small order for them to process it. Over priced and came in a bag. I paid less in the Cosmo and got a luxurious treatment and stay. They don‚Äôt clean. There are bottles and used glasses all around the fountains. Never again. Stay away. Oh also the pillows are from feathers but old so they poke your face the whole time you are sleeping. Stayed at the 10th floor on the palace tower. Disgusting/ will not return . Also if you are using ride share they are not allowed to pick you up at the front. So you literally have to drag all your luggage a good 5 min walk to the share ride spot. But taxis are allowed to go to the front. Again stay at Cosmo/planet Hollywood/ or Bellagio. Costs the same and you get a quality service at these hotels. Oh and the customer service is horrible. They treat you like a burden. Not worth the money.
10,This trip was a nightmareparking garage smelled like pee and very discussed with it. That was the least of my worriesme and my wife got stuck in a elevator for almost 25 min with no air conditioning.The elevator had no ventilation as none of the other emergency services were responding. The ringer button was working but we were getting no response. Was a very scary situation. Our room was very dirty  the bathroom light was out  the ironing board was broken with one of the legs snapped In half and I was unable to iron my clothes for a wedding I was in. Garbage was found in the room from the people before us . The bathtub faucet was broken.and almost everyone I asked for help was very rude and inattentive. Definitely the worst hotel experience I had in my life .
30,great decoration great space but its not a 5 star hotel why?  1. cheapest toilet paper i never used in my life  2. Towels hurt your skin when drying  3. 10$ water on the room they don't give you even 2 for free its a joke.  4. 1 hour to room service call get answer just to fix AC and on next day u need to call to clean your room so 4 hours at least waste on waiting for a answer...  5. all seems old on Julios TOWER the elevator everything... pay some more and get a PALACE ROOM TOWER.  6. no help with shows or help with tourist...  7. check-in took for ever...  8.on pool 500$ to get a good spot joke and 15$ beer and no food at all.  9. ceasars Reward almost imposible to get on palace u need to go to ballys or planet holliwood to get it.
50,From the first encounter at the door to the last day we left Caesar‚Äôs was exactly what we wanted in a Las Vegas experience Every staff person was professional helpful enthusiastic and well-informed. The COVID protocols were fully in place and well-enforced. The restaurants were top notch the drinks were flowing the gaming tables were in full operation and people from every walk of life rolled in and out doing their thing. ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! We‚Äôve traveled all throughout the US during COVID conditions and I can honestly say this was the best experience - over the top! So yes we were very pleased would highly recommend and will return. KUDO‚Äôs to the staff and management for keeping the spirit of Las Vegas alive and well at Caesar‚Äôs!!!
10,We paid over $3000 for two rooms for four nights. 4 persons total. We arrived after 3pm and our rooms were not ready. Room was nothing special basic MOTEL room. No refrig and no coffee maker.  I had to call 3 times because one of the rooms was never made up on a daily basis. All they care about is Nickel and Dime you to death. Extra charge for parking. Extra Charge for RESORT FEE NOTHING MORE THAN B.S. All the restaurants are VERY EXPENSIVE AND WAY OVER PRICED FOR THE QUALITY OF FOOD. Will never stay at this motel again. You got my money this time and I hope this stops other from falling prey to your B.S.
40,We stayed at the Octavious Tower. The room was nice with a view of the pool. Beds were OK. Seems like mattresses should be replaced. Sunk done alot. Overall the room was good. Be advised its a long walk to the casino but we found a short cut where you walk by the pool and come out by Bacchanal Buffet.
20,Where do I start every little thing is a extra charge and way overpriced. I was charged for 2 items out of the mini bar and did not even open it. I was told could use room key to exit parking without charge but it didn't work and had to pay $18 to get out of garage. The room AC did not work very well and never got real cool. I asked for a wake up call and did not get that either. This was probably the worst experience I have ever had in Vegas. Not happy at all.
50,It is a busy hotel a mall restaurant venue a coliseum the best nightclub i means Caesars Palace it is a landmark I LV I did love my experience at the hotel. Very nice gym awesome pool area let you think that we are part of a movie set from the Gladiator or from a Roman era movie. Awesome!!! This hotel it is an experience the rooms are very updated with everything you need. Very luxurious bed linens.
50,With covid going back & forth I feel this casino along with others has a lot to contend with. Spend 3 nites there last week & Caesars does it right. Employees are very polite plenty of room at the pools Rooms are as nice as always dealers are not crabby & most seem very happy & upbeat considering they have to wear a mask all day. Best of all is Diamond check in - ERIC ERIC ERIC.. such a kind professional accommodating (patient) friendly young man. I will be going back next week & hope to get Eric again. Also later in my trip 'Princess' at Diamond was very kind & helpful. Thank you LoRusso
30,Overrated. We stayed at the hotel with a tour group and were disappointed in several things. The room looked beautiful but had a plumbing design problem- probably venting which caused the sinks to fail to drain until the shower ran and then they would rush to drain. You could hear gurgling from the sinks regularly. We were also disappointed that they mandated masks rather than making them optional for vaccinated people. We could smell smoke through them so I‚Äôm sure germs can get in and out. There should be better signage to permit us to more easily find our way around.
10,We are diamond members and go on a average of once every 5 weeks . We were convinced to purchase an upgrade as we usually stay in the palace tower they informed us that they Augustus tower was by far worth a upgrade . During this pandemic we‚Äôve got so many times and saying such a change of clientele people in their pajamas in the lobby driving around a motorized carts when they‚Äôre not handicapped and the overwhelming stench of marijuana Along with the homeless outside the doors begging for money. Our room in the Augustus tower was not clean things were not in working order and we will never ever reserve or sleep in that tower again. What is truly truly disappointing is the fact that you spend a lot of money there I play slots and my husband‚Äôs place tables We had to go gamble at the Orleans to make any kind of money back because simply Caesars doesn‚Äôt pay !!! We realize that Caesars doesn‚Äôt care  like I see in previous reviews we are I significant in the Caesars world.
10,We are total rewards members (credit card and rewards program) we decided to bring family to convince them to change from  MLIFE to CAESARS REWARDS. We used our rewards for two rooms. Long story short we had originally requested to be next to each other. We were so FAR from each other. So far from the elevator. Both my sister and I have health issues that require us to be close to the elevator. We were on the complete other side to the stairs at the end. And far from one another. So none of those two request were made. We come to vegas a lot so have the ‚Äúnicer‚Äù room to my sister and her husband. Our room was HORRIBLE. So we went back down to speak to them to request if at least we can find a room closer to them or their side of the building and she said closer to 4pm we said okay. We felt she was irritated with other us and annoyed and last minute said if you want to be side by side I can do it now. (Keep in mind I told her numerous times we are here for our rewards to be able to stay at a free night or lower rates because we came here to have good dinners on the property and to play at the casino so she knew)    When we checked it out this morning we got the bill and we did not get the rates we wanted she had put us in an upgraded room without reassuring us. When we signed the documents she did not warn us about the up charge she just said here just sign here here and here. Very unprofessional and lack of customer service. I‚Äôve worked in customer service for almost 15 years. I make sure a customer knows what they are signing before they sign it because you just never know I know it‚Äôs their responsibility but again it‚Äôs the customer service that makes a difference. Overall we were so unhappy. And on top of everything We spent so much money at the Caesars properties and specifically at Caesars hotel that it was a shame that they couldn‚Äôt even help us. Now they really don‚Äôt want to come to cedars rewards:
50,Perfect weekend. Except for parking. Which was located on one side and hotel all the way on other side. If it‚Äôs your first time my suggestion would be drop your luggage at valet bell hop then go park.
50,The hotel was beautiful and the room was spectacular. Better than we expected. The views of the pool made the stay feel like we were somewhere else. Every employee that we met was amazing including Valencia at the pool and is it Isaac bellman.
10,I just arrived to the hotel and would definitely say service is so bad. 2 managers involved and they are arguing with you without listening. When you asked general manager email they immediately say no. Unacceptable the worst service ever!  I m here for my birthday and totally regret.  Just checked in and hoping to get resolved this issue
50,Amazing hotel! Perfect vegas vibe. Right in the middle of the strip and all the action. Fantastic restaurants. Definitely worth getting a cabana at the pools. Every restaurant was amazing. Bucchanal buffet had some of the best food. It was hard to get a reservation but the open their seating at 4:00 pm each day. If you put yourself on the list you‚Äôll be very likely to get a table
10,After checking in and wandering the hotel attempting to find our room for 30 minutes we finally found it. Then we made our way to the concierge desk to get our rewards cards. Our 15 year old daughter stood next to us the whole time we waited in line. As soon as it was our turn Lezel (the very unfriendly woman working) told me to get my daugter out of there. I was confused and asked where she wanted me to send her (as I wasn't going to leave her alone). Lezel told me to put my 15 year old in child care. I left the line and stood with my daughter inside the black lines of the casino walkway as to not get in any trouble. We waited while my husband signed up for the rewards card. They wouldn't allow him to sign me up tho. So Lezel waived me over as soon as I got to the counter my husband went the 20 feet back over to stand with our daughter. And Lezel proceeded to Shout at me that I wasn't allowed to leave her unattended and she needed to go somewhere else. Now I'm getting mad. She wasn't unattended she was now with her father still just standing inside the black lines. Doing. Nothing. Lezel then called security on me while she finished signing me up. Just as I was finished security showed up. They didn't say a word to me as we had done NOTHING wrong. We left and didn't even gamble at Caesars because they made that few minutes absolutely miserable and worrisome. I don't know if they were wanting my daugter to be alone somewhere because they had other ideas in mind for her or what was going on. But it was ridiculous. We have stayed at The Palazzo and The Luxor before and never had these kind of issues. We will never go back to Caesars Palace. Not after being treated this way.  We simply stayed one night on our way to California to visit our elderly sick parents. It was supposed to help destress us before we got to cali. It didn't.
10,This place has gone downhill so much ! rooms are worn out so much; pool ( for general hotel guests) water is murky and not clean. Can‚Äôt get Rooms cleaning services after calling 4 times  night staff Rosarixxxxxxxxx at gift shop is stupid n ignorant She does not know how comp points system work. Spa pass price gone way high to $125 with limited 3 hours use without informing guests.  Ceaser buffet is the Only opening buffet all others closed up for good. Price has gone up n cut back 7 stars member services too.    They must hire people to write 5 star reviews on google as soon as 1 star review showed up. That‚Äôs all they do instead of improving their services quality n facilities
20,Hotel is beat up rooms need a make over. We stayed in a two bedroom suite and got to say they are rally beat on dirty and tired. I really loved all the homeless people sleeping in the bushes as well. Pretty gross place to visit.
20,Stayed here in July and was our first time staying at Caesar‚Äôs. Construction out front and they moved the Uber/Lyft pick up spot all the way on the north side of the property. Apparently they didn‚Äôt communicate the new pick up/drop off locations with either company. We had 4 Ubers cancel on us because they couldn‚Äôt find us. Whatever company had flagmen out there directing traffic should be ashamed of themselves. Those people were ridiculously rude. I had round trip limo service to the airport and on the return day the flag man would not let our limo up front to pick us up. Limo driver was frustrated and ended up driving around the screaming flagman to pick us up. He got a good tip. Room was ok. Nothing special. The tower we were in seemed it needed some updating. The very long walks from the rooms to the pick up spots for Uber were frustrating and seemed that could have been handled better. They have a huge front entrance that could easily accommodate the Uber and Lyft drivers. Don‚Äôt know why they decided to move Uber and Lyft. Hopefully that is just temporary until construction is over.
20,The hotel itself is nice minus the construction at the front. This causes Uber drivers to drop off in a hole in the back of one of the casinos and they don‚Äôt know where to go. I walked around for 45 minutes before I figured out were to go. And I found the express check in by luck. No staff to ask where to go.    I try to check in at 530pm and the express check in says room isn‚Äôt ready. What??? Finally a staff member shows up and goes to a computer and all of a sudden it‚Äôs ready. She prints out directions to the room which were from the front desk. Ummmm I‚Äôm it at the front desk so I was lost again. And again‚Ä¶no staff in site to ask directions.    The check in asked me did I want the room serviced daily. I checked yes. That inky happened after the first night. After that nothing. No new towels. Garbage wasn‚Äôt emptied. Ridiculous.    Shops were always closed. Particularly the shops with drinks and small stuff in them. I guess so you had to gamble to get a free water or go to a restaurant and pay $10 for one bottle of water.
30,I was here on business so I didn't have to pay for anything we had a couple great meals. The rental car customer service was wonderful very helpful. The Starbucks line was always really long and took forever. Nobu was delicious. And we had some good ice cream.
20,This was my 2nd time staying at Caesars Palace. First the property is humongous. It took 20 mins to get to my room from the front desk. Everything is spread apart. It took 20 mins to get to where the Uber stop is. The hotel just does not flow well.  Rooms are outdated. Had a flood in one of the bathrooms of my suite. I noticed the base board was stained from water damage. Next day water all over that had seeped thru the wall from the shower into the area where the toilet & bidet were.  Only gave it two star because their theater is nice. Had a cabana during pool day and it was great. Next visit I will stay at another hotel for sure.
50,My wife and I enjoyed our stay at Ceaser‚Äôs Palace very much. The room was great with an excellent view. Housekeeping cleaned our room every day ‚Äì the reason I mentioned this is because some hotels give you the option to clean or not every day. The hotel staff were all very courteous and helpful. The casino is also centrally located but in Vegas you always have to walk. There are many excellent restaurants in Ceaser‚Äôs Palace. Anytime we are in Vegas we will definitely stay here again.
20,Be prepared to be charged for every little thing - including making coffee in your own room which is part of the Mini Bar!! Very Pricy. There is far superior upscale value in Vegas than Caesars Palace.
10,I love ceasars but hate the service most the time very slow and employees are not helpful. Spen 3 days being lied right to my face. Definitely dissatisfied this trip. They never moved us or even offered to change our room it was trashy wall paper coming off the walls and shtyipit in the toilet upon check in. Called and they said we will have it fixed. We checked out a night early and went to the cosmopolitan to a clean room.
10,I must admit I am highly taken aback about this property. As a Hilton diamond mbr it is a certain level of experience I expect. The rooms offer no microwave or fridge for personal use! They have a stocked fridge with a weight feature so they can see if u use the fridge which in turn is a $75 fee! Sooooo you can eat at their restaurants etc but dont have anywhere throughout the entire property to heat it or store it. I asked to speak with management regarding my concern and ruby came on the line. I am shocked this woman has any kind of leadership role. She was short dismissive and very rude. She actually said to me ‚Äúyou act as if this is something we offered or advertised. I could see that‚Äù like really no attempt to try to make it right whatsoever. Instead just asked me what would I like for her to do very sarcastically. When I said it didn‚Äôt seem as if she was concerned anyway I guess nothing she just dismissed me and hung up the phone. I‚Äôve never in my life experienced this kind of treatment at any property and def didn‚Äôt expect it from this expensive hotel/casino. Beware and please bring a cooler!
30,We reserved a room in the Julius Tower but the hotel offered us a couple of days before arriving a room at the Augustus tower with a discount. We applied for the upgrade (extra 32 dlls/night). The room had a great size but they didnt clean our room the second day and we dont know why. Another problem with the Augustus tower (and octavius) is that the tower is in the exact opposite of the place where you can take an uber so you basiclly have to walk all the hotel. And they are remodeling the entrance so you have to walk to las vegas strip to take a taxi. We saw an entrance near the Augustus tower but you cant take an uber/taxi there We were told that just for limos. If we had knew in advance those things we wouldnt apply for the upgrade and save monet
40,Rooms are equipped with a single cup kuerig coffee maker. The coffee kit for it is in a mini bar snack assortment on the desk area. If you use the coffee kit you will be billed for the entire snack assortment. They will credit it off the bill only if you complain. ‚ÄúIt is weight sensitive and registers movement if you explore the contents‚Äù. Be forewarned.
10,Whenever we go to Vegas we always try a new hotel on the strip to see which one we like.    We were 1st time guests staying at Caesars Palace from Sunday August 1st 2021 - Wednesday August 4th 2021.    I wouldn't say it was the worst experience we ever had on the strip but it was definitely one of the worst.    Many of the shops were never open. Restaurants have the wrong name above them in the food court from previous businesses that are no longer open (such as the Earl of Sandwich sign above the Pizza location).    We were really looking forward to the Bacchanal Buffet. We watched videos and read reviews online and it looked great. We show up on the last night of our stay only to be told it is reservations only. There is no signs posted anywhere saying it is reservations only. How are people supposed to know this?    We paid enough money for our room to receive a fridge for our own personal use but instead were given a fridge with a minibar with drinks that were overpriced. The fridge had a warning that you'd be fined $75 for using it for your own personal use. Even a Motel 6 gives you a fridge. Caesars Palace can't provide a fridge in an upgraded room that you pay a lot of money for? Just seems odd. Seems like something that is so basic you would expect that you would have it especially in an upgraded room.    Here's what took the cake: The last night of our stay we got locked out of our room. We went down to the front desk were given new keys went back up to the 26th floor and the door still wouldn't open. I'm not exaggerating when I say we came up and down about 5 times with 4 different sets of keys and still could not get our door open.    Gerald from Security is absolutely awesome and deserves a promotion! He came up and stayed with us for about 20 minutes to help us get back into our room. A technician had to eventually come up and get the door open.    We literally wasted an entire hour of our evening on the last night we were in Vegas just getting our hotel door back open again. I feel like Caesars Palace should have compensated us and made this right for wasting a whole hour of our night on the last night we were there.    Everyone who works there is super nice but the hotel itself seems very disorganized. I don't want to hear that Covid is an excuse because the things I mentioned are very easily fixable.    Especially not having someone from Caesars Palace reach out and make things right with us for wasting a whole hour of our evening frustrated going up and down 26 floors 5 times to do something so simple as getting back into our room is very frustrating and it just seems like the hotel doesn't care that much about their guests.
10,Zero service. We had to haul our own luggage across the property to our room with no help had to take out our own trash and beg for new towels. Paid $12 for a bottle of water no complimentary coffee not allowed to use fridge in room (that cost $75 extra). Currently under construction stay somewhere else!
50,Great stay‚Ä¶everything was perfect and clean. Beds were very comfortable. Love the taxi area‚Ä¶so easy to grab a cab when needed. I‚Äôve stayed at plant hollywood paris hotel and stratosphere before and cesars has been my favorite so far.
10,I have been in Vegas for 10 days and now finishing my trip with the Caesar palace for 3 days. It‚Äôs such a bad hotel ! Qualified as a 5 stars. But doesn‚Äôt have the service the 5 stars is supposed to offer to its customers. We are on the Palace tower. The rooms are old (as pictures attached). We asked to have a cleaner room and newer room as the picture we got when we booked the room. But no one has done anything. Moreover the walk by foot from the room to the lobby is about 500 meters. And we had to go 3 time a day. They never pick up the phone when you call them for an issus. And we got the door that doesn‚Äôt work with our card. No commercial offers to damage what happened. CRAZY !  If you are looking to stay in Vegas we recommend t The bellagio. It was by far the best hotel.
30,Tried to check in early but said my type of room was not available. Offered upgrade. Said $200. Yeah per night! First time tried to check in early but another front desk person said I was too early for that. Didn't mention that my type of room was not going to be available. Sounds like a scam to make me pay more. Then as I checked out tried to charge me a Margarita from mini bar. I didn't even touch it! Stayed as far a way as possible. Also with construction very confusing on rideshare. My Uber driver dropped me off by Forum Shops in lower half. One problem. Was not open at time. Had to walk all the way with luggage to front door. Didn't make my trip pleasant!
30,"Hi this is my second time in las vegas in 20 years last time I stayed in the MGM grand I assume many things have changed since then and obviously the pandemic has hurt evrybody's business - but I must say I was very disappointed from the experience I got in your Caesars Palace Hotel in Vegas especially after so much time I wanted to have a wonderful and glamorous experience and all we got was a very plain and standart room with a view to the wall one set of soaps and shampoo (even though it can be a room for 2 people) and everything is extra pay. nothing complimantry nothing extra mile to make sure we have a good memory of the place and would want to come back. Everytime I called the reception of guest service I had to wait 30(!) minutes on the phone to get something solved. We did get an upgrade but only after complaining about all that and paying extra for the view. We only got one night ""resort fee"" waved.  My boyfriend was celebrating his borthday and we werent even offered a complimantry anything. This is very disappointing from an hotel on such a big scale and with such a fampus reputation. I heard so many things of the luxurious Palaca but I must say that if I have to pay for everything in order to get some more luxurious and speciall expereince than I will look for a different hotel that provides it for the next time."
10,Room quality is that of an Inn furniture is all chipped faucet full of hard water.    Elevator door got stuck on us.    Expected a lot more from Ceasars Palace. Not our 1st trip to Vegas but definitely last time staying at Ceasars.
40,Our first time staying at Caesar‚Äôs hotel. Big & beautiful hotel. We arrived about 1130 am for check in where we were told we will be charged $40 for early check in‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Never heard this before so we were stunned but agreed. Upon entering our room the ac was off we turned it on got ready for the pool and left. Amazing pools much room for separation during covid. When we returned to our room ( 3 hours later ) our room was at a blazing 76 degrees. Ac was not working. I made my way to the front desk spoke with a manager who offered $75 in food credit; a maintenance Cree to be sent up immediately I refused the food credit since we already went to dinner and headed bed for our early 5am flight wouldn‚Äôt be able to use it. Manager then offered waived resort fees for us. Fine. Headed back to the room hour passed no one came to check the ac. Called down again they said someone would be there shortly. I fell asleep in our 76 degree room with my baby to have the maintenance man show up hours later to fix our ac. He said oh about an hour the room will cool down. Never did.  Our waived fees were honored at checkout.  Great options for restaurants  I would stay here again and just have hopes for a working ac in the middle of summer.
10,We were told our room was upgraded with a Jacuzzi tub we get in the room no tub. We called front desk 4 times throughout the trip 1 hour hold time and hung up on while on hold. No maids to clean the room and no towels.    However there were plenty of dealers and tables were available to gable at. I guess some jobs are more important to the property than others.
30,Although the hotel is beautiful‚Ä¶..I did to experience good customer service! I actually had to check in 3 times (on line when I got there but too early to check in unless I wanted to pay an additional $40) and again when I returned at check in time. Nobody apologized for the terrible inconvenience! Time spent for the 3 check ins was well over 1 hour. Too big to care I guess! I was there on business otherwise I probably would have looked at another place to stay. The bed was very comfortable and rooms were clean. It had a very large bathroom with a wonderfully large tub. Although they provided a coffee machine they don‚Äôt provide coffee‚Ä¶..you pay extra for that. When I bought lunch at the crepe place I asked for a little cup of water so I could take some medicine they said ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have cups you have to purchase the small bottle of water for $7. Anyway not a good overall experience at the hotel but will stay somewhere else next time in Vegas.
50,I recently stayed at this property. My first time in a while since I gave feedback on room for improvement. In the midst of the rise in a new variant they to exceptional care in following all standards of current guidelines. From entry to check out my experience made me feel safe that they went above and beyond. All the staff worked well under pressure considering it was an overwhelming interest in the property while I was there. I stayed in the Octavius tower. The kept the elevators disinfected as well. Security was visibly present throughout the hotel. This is important to me as a solo traveler. The buffet was well maintained and properly ensured all service staff disinfected constantly. It was the closest thing to normal in a long time for me. Pool time was fun and safe. The shows are plentiful. It gave me hope. Kudos to all the staff there! I will be back for NYE! Bringing my walking shoes!
30,We were in town to attend three different trade shows our main show at the Ballrooms at Caesar's Palace (first year at this location.) A six night stay cost almost $2500.00. Room was pretty but not worth the price. Pillows were feather filled pancakes and awful! Be prepared there is a Keurig coffee maker but the 4 pack of pods in the mini bar will set you back $20.00. Coffee at their cafes/restaurants will set you back $8-10 per cup bottled water is a minimum of $6.50 per bottle and all the restaurants (with the exception of the lousy food court) are EXCEPTIONALLY PRICEY. The buffet was very good but be prepared to spend $80.00 per person before taxes for dinner. A cocktail will set you back $15.00 for a well liquor. The ballrooms are clean and pretty; however no one has laundered the curtains in hallway since hanging and inches of dust are underneath if you move bottoms. Some areas were starting to show age and becoming dog-earred (paint is dirty and faded around air vents finger prints pealing wallpaper.) The resort fees are $50 a day and that is atrocious and unnecessary. It's obvious Caesar's is making up for their Covid closure and passing on the deficit to their customers shame on you! This isn't how you keep people coming back. Buyer beware - bring lots and lots of money just to stay and eat.
40,As usual Caesars Palace did not disappoint. We were checked in by Eric in the diamond check-in and he was beyond pleasant. Any and all concerns were addressed in a patient way. I like anyone being patient with my questions. My only complaint was with the rewards center. I had a very very rude woman when I went to ask some questions. I finally just walked away from her. She was the only person at Caesars that wasn‚Äôt ultra pleasant.
10,If you touch the mini bar to read an item and put it back you are charged if you breathe on the mini bar you are charged if you walk by the minibar you are charged what a freaking racket then they charge you a $75 restocking fee for restocking nothing! This happened to every member of our party in their own room ! They will be sued as I‚Äôm sure this occurs on a daily basis to unsuspecting guests!
30,I was sold on a pool view room but when I arrived I was given an ‚Äú upgraded‚Äù room which was facing the roof to and AC units. What a joke! The hotel manager took no ownership. He could care less about how I felt.
50,I a s time share owner but a friend talked me on to come to Caesars palace it was expensive but worth every penny I only stayed 2 nights 8/9 to 8/11 and I am going to tell it was worth it I don‚Äôt win anything but still had a good time best place to Hells kitchen is a neat do you say at Las Vegas very good and awesome Caesars palace associates for the restaurants were awesome and the restaurants are very tasty and goodI will indeed tell friends thank you for the great time
20,Not a bad place it just made me mad that I checked in online and still had to wait 2 hours in line for a key. Then there was the duplicate Minnie bar charges its taking an act of congress to get Cesar's to refund me my duplicate charges. I am going round and round with no result getting my money back.
20,I stayed here recently for my birthday. The room was terribly dirty. Stains and dust everywhere! Very out dated room chipped paint dirty walls the worst was the dried blood stains on the sheets. I had to report it 4 times took them about 6 hours to change them. Gross!
50,This is a review for the pool and cabana only. We were in the Bacchus cabana. This is my favorite of the caesars pools. We were upstairs basically had the pool to ourselves. Our host Jason checked in on us periodically always with a smile. Sadie our waitress was outstanding. If she sees this I'm the one with the flamingos. ü¶© she checked in on us often and was so sweet. Definitely my favorite pool of our trip.    I hope they bring back the fruit platter sodas and food service next year. The tables were not open in the pool Tuesday's and Wednesdays which was a bummer. But it didn't really ruin our fun.
40,Beautiful Hotel the installation restaurants bar casino pool are so amazing made for Gods. I love it.  The only minor complaint will be the regular cleaning services was not consistent. During my 7 days stained at the hotel the room was clean only once.
20,Nice property though a little scoffed up. But the bill I got upon checking out required a CPA in order to parse. It took an hour of phone and chat time to remove the two erroneous mini bar charges and I still don't have a bill that I can submit for expense reporting. I tried calling the website chat... and can't get through to any sentient being that can help me. Disgusting customer service.
40,Caesars Palace was a beautiful hotel to stay in with a large casino lots of dining and shopping options and a beautiful pool. The rooms are in need of minor repairs (think chips of paint and soap dishes that need to be re-caulked) but other than that the rooms were clean the bed was super comfy and the service was excellent! We will definitely stay here again.
10,Evander Torio & Krista Valle are worthless as front desk lead & Manager!! They need training on Hospitality! I have been staying at Caesars Palace for over 20 years the hotel is very run down and dirty!! My stay has been the worst experience ever! We were moved to a different room which was smaller and just as bad. When we try to contacted the front desk and waiting 40 mins on hold we had to go down to the front desk those mgrs were worthless and very rude. VERY DISAPPOINTED CUSTOMER!!!
10,we reserved and payed room ahead of time and when we got there they charged us more they didn't even knew what for after many times of asking supposedly it was a fee that it was going to go back to our bank accounts still haven't !! front desk employees and manager extremely rude and don't know what they are doing or charging .
10,DO NOT STAY HERE    Do not be fooled into thinking that this is a luxury hotel or even a decent hotel -- this is a deplorable motel exploiting the fact that it is in a building with a fun theme and has a glamorous past.    I had the misfortune of having to stay here as it was the conference hotel for a conference I was attending for work. The check in line was as long as an airport security line. Another guest told me it took AN HOUR AND A HALF TO CHECK IN. Fortunately I was able to do VIP check in. The VIP experience was undercut by there being trash on the floor of the check in area. There was TRASH EVERYWHERE.    I experienced things at this hotel that I have never before witnessed from HOMELESS PEOPLE BATHING IN THE FOUNTAINS to HOMELESS PEOPLE SLEEPING IN THE GARDEN.    Housekeeping did not come to my room the second day. YOU CAN'T CALL THE FRONT DESK you can only text. The person I was texting with LIED that my Do Not Disturb sign had been on the door. When I returned to my room even later housekeeping still had not come. I ASKED FOR TOWELS AND THEY CAME HOURS LATER AFTER I WAS IN BED. I was directed by text to GATHER UP MY OWN DIRTY TOWELS AND GIVE THEM TO THE BELLHOP.    Only after I asked to speak to the manager did the person I was texting with begin texting me in real time as opposed to hours after my messages. This person promised housekeeping would come to my room the next day at a time I requested. THIS WAS A LIE. I was again given the lie about a Do Not Disturb sign and told housekeeping couldn't get to the room. When I said that both days I had seen housekeeping in the hall the text service told me they were cleaning check out rooms. At this point it became clear to me that the hotel had NO INTENTION OF SERVICING THE ROOM DURING MY STAY and was LYING TO HIDE THIS. I had to MAKE UP MY OWN BED to have a decent background for a Zoom meeting.    They lied that management would contact me in a given time frame -- management didn't. Days after that time frame someone left a message on my phone promising to call back -- no one has called me back. I could say more -- much more -- but you do you really need me to do so?    DON'T STAY HERE!!!!!
10,First time that my husband and I traveled to Vegas and first time staying at Ceasar's Palace. We were there 5 days 4 nights. Flight came in early so we tried for an early check in. There was no early check in for our room. The front desk clerk advised a room was available for an upgrade $40 a day more. My husband paid cash for the upgraded room. We had to request clean towels and someone to straighten our room up after 2 1/2 days being there. That was the first and only time house keeping came to our room. The customer service was terrible. After check out they charged my CC $204.08 extra. I advised why we had to pay an upgrade fee at the time of check in and out. Over a month later still waiting on Mgr to call me back. Worst experience ever..
10,The penthouse is horrible. Broken shower handles wires hanging out of the fridge one didnt work and one barely worked. Service is horrible. No coffee for coffee maker no snacks or liquor in fridge ipod docs from what looked like the first ipod made LOL. It smelled like a dirty ashtray. This isnt all that was wrong with the room but my fingers dont have the stamina to type them all out im sure. This room was a joke!
10,"Pool service was great otherwise had to beg for room service that only happened once in 4 days. Bathroom door needed two people to open or close...never was asked if we would want a different room and sent worker to fix and he said it was ""too big a job"" to happen anytime soon. Terrible odor in halls to pool and many shops closed during the week. We were shocked as we have stayed there before."
20,"Upon arrival we were directed to rude Jelina whom with a finger pointed upwards no eye contact barked ""one minute"" while staying busy at her computer (why call next in line if you're not ready?).  We had tried the express check in kiosk prior to coming to the front desk for the kiosk itself was of not help. It did however charged us $200 for no apparent reason and that's when we decided to get help from an agent not knowing this attempt would turn out to be a horrible experience.    Once finished at her computer the aforementioned lady looked up at us with the most unpleasant stare. No words just a prolonged sort of ""what do you want"" kind of look on her tired bored face.    I told her we were checking in to which she cut me short and asked for ID and credit card. While I handed her my documents my friend asked about the charge on her card at the kiosk.    Context: I had reserved 3 rooms and had been charged for all the fees and extra charges already.    Jelina could not explain in a satisfactory way she rather kept cutting us and giving bogus explanations which made no sense at all.  Upon finally realizing she was just babbling what she thought was expert answers she came to her senses and went back to get a manager. We thought that after all we were going to get help from someone with more experience and knowledge. We were so wrong!    This is when Krista came into the scene. We told her about the charge to which she proceeded to offer three different answers as to why this had happened: First: The kiosk charges $100 per night as deposit. We told her: That's ok but we're staying one night only so why the $200 charge. Second answer: No it's actually $100 per room. Ok but my friend only has one room on her name so again why the $200 charge. Third answer: Actually the kiosk charges $200 no matter how many nights/rooms your stay is for.    Krista left us dumbfounded after all of this nonsense. She then proceeded to correct the mistake and left us in the hands of Jelina again!    Jelina asked for the name of the third person in the reservation. I told her the the first and last name. after a few seconds she asked: ""I need ID and card from whomever the third room is for!"" I told her: It's not ""whomever"" I just told you his name. She said: I didn't hear. Why didn't you ask I said. I'm in front of you. To this she got so mad you could see the rage even through her face mask and fake lashes. I ran out of space. Avoid Jelina at all costs."
40,I have to say..I had a good time at Caesars Palace! I stayed in the Octavius Tower and got a great rate because this trip was planned a year ago as soon as we heard Usher was in residency here!    The check-in w/Tiffany was efficient and she was able to address the groups needs (having all rooms on the same floor)! There weren‚Äôt any rowdy guest in the floor except us‚Ä¶Haahaa    I enjoyed getting up early and heading to the casino..the wait time for drinks is quicker and my favorite slot machines (Wheel of Fortune & Plinko) were available too!    I enjoyed the lobby restaurant that was open 24 hours (of course over priced) but you pay the cost for convenience!    While there we rented a Cabana for the group‚Äôs ‚Äòofficial pool day‚Äô! I would suggest if you have a large group..go for it because it is worth the cost (over $500) for the hours of 9a-5p (Guess who was there to check-in @ 8:55a..lol)    Overall I was pleased with what Caesars had to offer and remember these hotels are humongous..so being your walking shoes so you can explore every square foot in the most comfortable way!
50,Our trip to Ceasars Palace was outstanding! The staff the room and the food was very good! We felt the gaming was a little tight but overall a fabulous trip. With this all said we will definitely be planning a return to Ceasars in the very near future!! Thank you!
10,Typically I never write reviews but thought this was necessary. We are avid Vegas travelers and always stay at MGM. This time we decided to stay at Caesars for the first time. We did not have clean towels for 3 days of our stay. I couldn't even call housekeeping because our room phone was broken. Our friends had to call for us from another room. After they assured us the towels would come they never arrived. On top of that they gave us the wrong room. Every time we tried to talk to the front desk the lines were outrageously long. We were only there for 2 nights and the last thing I wanted to do was spend most of my time with customer service. So disappointed in this hotel. I'll never stay here again nor would recommend this hotel to anyone.
40,I stayed here from Monday to Friday. Yes check-in was a nightmare. And yes it's clear as day they are not properly staffed for the influx of people checking in. I booked directly with caesars and was able to check in early at the kiosk. Well many people were having issues with the kiosk so I had to wait on another line for the kiosk attendant to help. (Apparently the kiosk wouldn't let me get a key because I wasn't using the same credit card for my incidentals as I used to pay for the room.) Which is ridiculous! That shouldn't even matter for me to check in. If I want to use a different card for incidentals then I should be able to do that. The kiosk attendant has their own little podium to tend to guests but didn't have the equipment or resources at the podium to give guests what they needed. She had to go to the main counter every time to look up your info get keys etc which was just NOT productive at all. Overall I was able to check in early around 2ish after waiting for 30 minutes since I got there. The main check in line probably would've taken 1.5 hours based on how slow they were moving. And again this is a monday before 2pm    They started construction on the main lobby & entrance. So taxi pickup is still in front....but closer to the strip in the grassy courtyard entrance. There are workers out there to help you if need but you shouldn't have to rely on them. The signage inside the hotel to help direct you around the construction is TERRIBLE! They really need to do a better job at that. Larger signs and better communication. Heck I didn't even know there was construction going on until the day before when I happened to be reading vegas news online. I received no communication from Caesars Entertainment in email text or website that there was construction happening even though they have no problem texting me to rent a cabana for the pool....or to try out their many fine dining restaurants. Overall the construction is not that big of a deal unless you're trying to get a cab where you have to walk a further distance for. But communication can be better.    As far as the room I stayed in the palace towers which were beautiful. The halls and elevators were clean and my room was perfect. I had a nice view of the mirage and partial view of the strip (even though I didn't book a strip view room). My section of the hall was very quiet. I honestly don't think anyone occupied the rooms around me at all. I'm hoping that's the beauty of a weekday visit. There was a house keeping presence but I decided to opt out of housekeeping based on the horrible reviews I've been hearing about the service. I just didn't have time to worry about whether I would get service that day or not...so if I needed something I figured I'd call/text the concierge.    I loved that the pool entrance was directly across the elevators to palace towers which made pool access that much easier. The pool was very busy by 10:30a for a weekday in the dead of summer. I got there at 9:15 and there were plenty of chairs to choose from. But if you think you're gonna find multiple chairs next to each other by 11a near the main pool you will be disappointed. Get there early if you have a large party. The bar/food service near the main pool was pretty slow. I did't expect to get service from a walking waitress so I went to the window myself. Once again very understaffed. 1 guy behind the window to full-fill all these orders at a packed pool is ridiculous.    The food options at Caesars is not that great if you're looking for something that isn't fine dining. 3 of the food places in the food court were closed when I was there. Pronto by Giada was very good but their menu is not as robust as it was when it opened or perhaps pre-covid. they seem to just sell mainly breakfast foods until they close with very little lunch options. Actually I feel like they can do a better job for lunch options period in this casino.    The casino itself is not my favorite to gamble at. The energy and vibe of the people were always what attracted me to Caesars but not the gambling experience. And since covid I barely saw hand sanitizer stations like in other casinos. The slot machines were still junky with cups cigarette ashes and food from the night when I went down at 8am. A very big difference from the Venetian for example where the attendants were cleaning after people all day...and hand sanitizer stations were literally everywhere.    Overall my weekday stay at Caesars really wasn't that bad. I guess because I didn't have high expectations from the beginning. I would stay here again...but only during the weekday. I don't think the prices of the weekend are worth it.
10,This was a solo stay August 1-7 having checked out just this morning. My stay was riddled with problems starting with never having received maid service the entire 6 nights/7 days.  I arrived Sunday around 12:30 and was shocked to see more than 200 people in the check-in line. It took 1 1/2 hours to reach the desk and the girl immediately told me she was new. My reserved room was not ready so I said I will take whatever is ready. A manager upgraded me to a pool view room in the Palace Tower and of course I was charged the $40 early check-in fee. Room was large quiet and bed was comfy. The bathroom had 2 sinks one of which did not drain. There was a dead squished roach (?) in the corner of the shower. There were 2 bath towels and one set of toiletries and no spare roll of toilet paper.    There were lines for everything. To go to the pool you had to queue and they checked bags to make sure you were mot bringing a bottle of water. For hundreds of people at the pool they had one waitress (at least on Tuesday). I left the pool area because I was super thirsty and couldn‚Äôt get a drink there. Pretty much the same was true for restaurants. You needed a reservation but the ones that were open were booked a month in advance. I ended up being forced to the food court. Ugh!    Each morning I was doing an activity outside Las Vegas so was getting picked up before 6am. There were piles of bagged up trash by room doors and by the elevators. There was the same cigarette on the floor in front of one elevator for 2 days. Because of doing activities in the desert I was taking 3 showers a day and by Wednesday those 2 towels were pretty nasty. No one had cleaned my room removed trash resupplied toiletries or changed towels. I was also low on toilet paper. I saw a maid down the hall and asked her for toilet paper. She said she only had one roll and asked ‚Äúare you sure you really need it?‚Äù What kind of hotel is this?????    Housekeeping never answered the phone nor did the front desk. I waited 45 minutes at the front desk to try to get someone to get me clean towels and get my room serviced. A manager named Astin said he contacted housekeeping and they would bring more towels & my room would be serviced. Later that evening a man brought a bag of towels and left them at my door. No trash removal. No toiletries replaced. Nada.    On my 5th day/6th night a maid opened the door to my room and said she had on her list that I had checked out. Ummm no. I asked if she would clean my room. No. She was there to get it ready for the next guest. So back down to the lobby to wait in the front desk line AGAIN for about an hour. Someone on the front desk had mistakenly checked me out!!! They offered to remove the last 2 nights resort fee. They reinstated my room and they assured me even though it was my last day someone would service my room. None of this happened.    As of check out this morning 6 nights/7 days my room was NEVER serviced. The smashed roach was still in the shower. The empty toiletries were never replaced. The trash was more than overflowing in my room. And you guessed it the resort fee was STILL on my BILL! So once again back down to wait another 20minutes in the front desk line and of course the clerk had to call a manager to see if it was true the resort fee was supposed to be removed. Yep it was supposed to be removed but had not happened. The clerk was not the least bit apologetic.    Caesars Palace is NOTHING like it was 20+ years ago. Staff excuses the lack of service to being short staffed. Here is a novel idea; close 2 towers and you will have adequate staff for guests. I would NEVER stay at this dump again.
20,They charge you for EVERYTHING that is typically complimentary. Ex. $75 dollars a night if you use the refrigerator and water and coffee pods in room are not free. Cheapest meal at resort $30 cheeseburger
50,Hitomi at the front desk was wonderful in assisting all of my needs and went above and beyond to ensure a pleasant stay. I will definitely stay again knowing the front desk has high quality staff like Hitomi.
30,So I‚Äôll start by saying as a Diamond rewards member we normally love Caesars we visit Vegas 5-6 times a year and it‚Äôs our go-to. I normally don‚Äôt do reviews but this recent visit was ridiculous. Room customer service and buffet were a let-down for us. I started by booking two suites(40 days in advance) in the Julius tower we were visiting with family and wanted rooms close to one another for coordinating and hadn‚Äôt stayed in the Julius tower yet. At check-in they gave us rooms in separate towers and explained that they were 26 rooms overbooked. Whatever we‚Äôll coordinate by phone and just hoof it across the entire casino to meet up. When we got to our room it was very hot we turned the AC down but ended up sleeping with no blankets and sweating all night long. I went to casino host and Diamond lounge and told them both about the AC. No new room but they put in an engineering request. No engineer ever came. At the end of our 4 night stay I notified them of our checkout early the following morning and I told the Diamond lounge host about our sweaty hot experience and lack of service and they were totally unapologetic and just gave me a TripAdvisor card to rate my experience (here I am). We had also been looking forward to Bacchanal Buffet since it‚Äôs reopening. Fortunately as a Diamond member we were able to skip the reservation and the line it only took us 10 minutes to get a table at a pretty busy time for dinner. They also escorted us to our table and gave us a tour of the buffet and told us our waitresses name. 25 minutes later we still hadn‚Äôt saw or heard from our waitress no drinks nothing. So I flagged down a gentleman and he promptly got on his radio and a very kind waiter from a nearby station helped us with drinks. We finally saw our waitress about 45 minutes in. The food was great but service started strong and then messed the bed. When you‚Äôre spending over $500 on a meal you expect a little more. Overall normally Diamond status with Caesars has enough perks to make it feel worth it and make you feel special but this was a huge exception. Just totally disappointed. Someone needs to restore the level of service to where it was in the past. Not related to just this visit but since I‚Äôm reviewing I‚Äôll add it in there Caesars needs more cocktail waitresses every time we are at slots it‚Äôs 20-30 minutes before you get a drink or a visit. There are other casinos that are worse but others are much better. At the tables you get plenty of service but slots are very lackluster.
30,Pros: Property is beautiful. Later in evening went down to check in desk in hopes of finding help with room key issue and a super guy named Kevin helped us out in no time! He was a huge help to us and was much appreciated. When we finally got our room issues resolved we were able to check in to a nice beautiful room.  We understood shortage of service so lack of housekeeping was not a problem for us. We called when we needed things and they were brought to us. Although I do miss quality of service before Covid! We enjoyed playing the slots there and one of us even hit a small jackpot!    Cons: Stood in line at check in for what seemed like hours. Very few front desk workers. Kiosks were lined up also. Some not working. Four sisters trip and had issues with getting room key. Took all day to get it resolved.
50,I was very happy with everything in the resort and it‚Äôs seen to be getting better with the new renovations. I‚Äôm looking forward to my next trip in November. Plenty of food options and very friendly staff.
20,We were here for 3 nights and housekeeping never came even though we asked them to at least 1 time. When we did request them to at least change the bedding they said they would be right up only to find them giving us the sheets in a bag and we had to make it ourselves.
20,I took my daughter and I on a weeks vacation to Vegas. After reading online reviews I selected three hotels to stay at the Trump international the Cesar palace and the palace station. This review will focus on the Cesar palace. Let‚Äôs start with their so-called Covid adherence getting checked into this hotel was a nightmare the casino floor is packed shoulder to shoulder no social distancing happening no enforcement of social distancing is happening the casino floor reeked of both tobacco and marijuana smoke. Once I checked in using the express check in the room Cleanliness was subpar this hotel is in need of a renovation. The hotel is hungry meaning there is no value staying here everything is extremely expensive and hard to access their swimming pool area was packed no Covid adherence no social distancing all they‚Äôre doing is requiring you to wear your mask but no enforcement. I stayed at this hotel for two days The second night the room had not been cleaned and no additional towels provided. I would have given this hotel a one star had it not been for their helpful and polite staff.
30,As it took getting a new room assignment after waiting all day to get a room. Once I got there my key did not work 3 trips later to the front desk and maintenance had to change the battery in my door. The air was not working properly and maintenance had to come and change the filter. After being exhausted  a pair of my sandals disappeared. I thought maybe I left them at home. When I arrived home my daughter said nope you took them mom. So the only person who had been in my room at that point was housekeeping.
20,Check in likes are horrible!!!! Be prepared to wait 45+min to check in I did get checked in by Jennifer at the front desk very delightful young lady Upgraded to the palace tower- tower was ok but the housekeeping is so understaffed they will straight up tell you they cannot clean your room. Caesar‚Äôs palace seems like it cannot keep with with the amount of volume it has so the quality is just NOT there. The staff is great- however I will not be back.
10,Son's 21st birthday with five friends my husband and myself. Three rooms for two nights. First trip after all fully vaccinated. Booked months in advance I also spoke to customer service early on about the reservation as it was important the boys had adjoining rooms. We paid for the nicer rooms (fountain/strip view - Augustus tower) for the boys and a nicer suite for my husband and myself. Their room was for two rooms (adjoining) with two queen beds each. Upon check in the rooms were not ready. LONG LINES. Eventually we got one room and then when the next became available we realized they were not adjoining. Waited A LONG TIME to speak with someone at the desk..... Nothing they could do they said.... ? I stayed there trying to make sense of how they couldn't do anything when I had spent so much and followed up more than once..... and they even admitted they saw the note on the reservation about adjoining rooms.... They ended up removing the resort fees on our room ....That was all. I read all the horror stories and didn't think it would happen. They really do not care about making good on their mistakes or what customers think. They are a money making machine and I am sure had we left - they would have easily just sold our rooms to the next person. Our room (for my husband and I ) in Augustus was still not ready after 4pm so we ended up changing towers so we could get a room and a shower and barely make our first night's dinner reservation. I really wanted to see the fountains at night from our room (and paid for that). That was sad. The room in Octavious overlooked the pool but had issues (phone didn't work/hold a charge... shower leaked into the toilet closet....). The bed was very comfortable I can say that. Two different times we came back to our room and our key cards did not work. Once late at night (both times my husband had to go down and resolve at the desk). One person said we were supposed to check out... (had not even had one of the two nights we paid for yet at that point...) Lots of people working who looked run ragged. Can't be upset with the help - understaffed and not appreciated. Shame on Caesars for that (or for booking so many people if they can't properly manage the reservations). The bar just outside check in had the most unfriendly/caring bartender I have ever met. Literally barely said one or two words to us and seemed annoyed we ordered a drink . Great way to start... The prices for the rooms in July were unreasonably high (especially when you don't get what you reserved months earlier) - no access to a fridge was something we expected from reading reviews ----- but would have been nice for guests. Bring your own K cups for coffee if you want that in your room - they charge a lot for them. Going to Vegas with a girlfriend later this month and staying at the Palazzo for four days. Looking forward to check in and customer service at a hotel that always seems to make guests' satisfaction a priority... never again will I stay at Caesars.
10,"We decided to take a last minute trip to Las Vegas for my early birthday. Our last visit to Las Vegas was years ago but the last time we were there I remember this hotel being super nice. Well things have certainly changed. We booked a Julius Deluxe king that had been ""newly refurbished"" because it was only one night and didn't need much more than a place to sleep. While driving down we received an email that we could complete our early check in online great well if you wanted your room early there is a $40 charge. I've never paid to check in early but being this was a one night visit we thought ok and agreed to pay $40. We arrive and attempted to check in on the kiosk that didn't work. Got up to our room and it was beyond disgusting. Carpet ripped furniture looked like it had beat with a bat. We go down to the registration desk to stand in line for ONE HOUR to receive yet another pathetic room. We were given a $35 resort credit oh thanks. The next morning we receive our bill by email only to find that we had been charged for the mini bar NOT USED no resort credit and the early check in was now $45 oh there's tax tacked on. Stood in line for yet another HOUR. No one tells you that there is a charge if you touch the stuff on the mini bar and put it back there is no sign in the room ANYWHERE stating this or providing pricing we were simply looking for the coffee. They took the charges off but instead of enjoying our last morning  we spent it in line yet again. I will never return to this hotel."
30,Good: location views and how quickly they handled problems with our rooms  Bad: toilet didn‚Äôt work bathtub didn‚Äôt work hallways were pretty dirty/needed a good vacuum  But all problems were addressed in a great manner!!
50,25th anniversary trip Had a great time Caesars was awesome can‚Äôt complain. Be ready to do a lot of walking that‚Äôs only thing I would tell anyone beautiful hotel I would stay there again Right now the lines are very long to do anything you‚Äôre in line for at least 15 minutes to eat or do anything
30,Booked a suite room in forum tower. The elevators are all either graffiti‚Äôed damaged or a combination of the two.    Multiple times during the stay our room had little to no water pressure especially on hot side. Literally air coming out of the faucets. Jets in tub didn‚Äôt work.    Housekeeping never visited our room the entire time we were there had to call and ask for towels daily.    Rented a cabana at Venus pool was a decent experience. Zero shade in the pool itself. Were told misters at the cabanas couldn‚Äôt be turned on due to drought but few hours later walked outside hotel and the misters were on at the hotel bar that wasn‚Äôt even open.    The tables had reasonable minimums.    Tons of good and reasonable food options.    Went to cash out before checking out on Saturday at noon. Waited 45 minutes. There was only 2 cashiers working and probably 40 people in line that was still growing when I got through.    Return trip we will probably be back at Bellagio.
30,I will start with the positive the Hotel is beautiful. We have stayed in many different hotels on the Vegas Strip were very exited about visiting the Caesars for the first time celebrating my birthday but were disappointed when we came back from the summing pool on Saturday and our room was not cleaned called house keeping and the from desk only to be on hold for 30 minutes each time and they did not picked up either line. On Sunday the same thing happened the room was not cleaned again and we had no clean towels no shampoo no lotion the trash can were full to the top ; we had been using the same dirty towels. At this time I was extremely upset and call the housekeeping line and from desk with no answer just like the day before. I went down to the registration desk to be waiting in line for 25 minutes they were not attentive at all bottom line instead of being the great experience I was looking for it was extremely disappointed and will not spend my money booking at the Caesars in the future. I have never had a bad experience at any of Las Vegas hotels in the pass. Never expected from the Caesars :(
10,Hate to bash any business but my over night stay at Caesars was practically camping I could have saved $300.00 plus and set up camp in the lobby. The room was updated but you could tell it was old and had maybe 2 outlets and others were covered by wall paper. I called the front desk 3 times because the air conditioning wasn‚Äôt working no answer on all three occasions when I went down to the desk I got NO help.They must have been having trouble with the AC because the Casino was hotter than my room and it was filthy no wipes available to wipe down machines‚Ä¶ every machine I sat at was sticky and haven‚Äôt cleaned in days.    I attended their ‚Äúnew‚Äù pool which was nice but the bar was gross my drink tasted like dirty ice the pool staff was excellent and hardworking unlike the front desk staff or any of the management inside. Also the pool has so much potential but attracted a weird crowd. The only food option was to order from Gordon Ramsey. If you have a pool like that they could capitalize with better food options.    At one point during check out a man asked if the business center was open and the lady at the front desk just rudely said no and when he asked what does Caesars do for people who have to work? she just ignored him. This was my 1st and last stay at Caesars! When explaining my issues nothing was taken off my bill! Also their were holes in the ceiling.    Safe to say my overnight trip was not a good one and Caesar‚Äôs should be ashamed of how they keep their property especially while the world is recovering from a pandemic.
30,I stayed here because my Grandson really wanted to. It was a graduation/birthday trip for the two of us. The location is ideal central to many attractions. The property is very nice and clean the staff is friendly and helpful. The room was large and comfortable. Then the irritation begins. I don't think of myself as a mental giant but I've never had an issue using the lights anywhere I've been. The switches and light combinations were so confusing we ended up unscrewing bulbs to turn them off. The room offers a coffee maker but it's over $15 per coffee setting. Are you kidding???? that's always been a freebie at other places. Trying to order room service is a joke and cannot be done the night before for breakfast. Also the delivery charge ends up costing more than breakfast itself. Getting breakfast at the restaurants means a 45min wait at minimum. Also good luck getting a human being to answer the service phones. Last but not least was the confusion for UBER drivers. Apparently Caesers changed location and rules for UBER drop off and pick up but never notified anyone. I have to say that overall I was highly disappointed and irritated with the experience. I did have a wonderful time with my Grandson and that was the main thing for me.
40,Excellent beautiful and clean facilities. Hand sanitizer and face masks were available throughout the hotel. The basic room at Forum Tower was as expected. We would have appreciated a more informative check-in process.
40,Caeser's location was prime. Our room was below average and underwhelming. The AC was dripping like crazy. We called maintenance and nobody ever came. So then we called the next day and still nobody came. We just put a bucket under the drip so it didn't get the carpet wet. Front desk service when we came into the hotel was good. Housekeepers skipped our room one day which was odd. Casino was nice. The pool were a little disappointing because there was empty cups and trash all over the place. Beautiful pools just needed a busser to clear all the trash. Despite all those things it was a great time. We love Vegas so we will be returning however next time we will probably stay at different and more up to date hotel.
40,Just spent an night there. Loved the pool and the pool staff. We had a handicapped room my friend is in a wheelchair. Room was great. Large doors beautiful bathroom beds were large and comfortable. I would definitely go back.
40,Located in the heart of Vegas! Very nice inside and out. Free parking for guests. Some of the check-in associates need to check their attitudes. Other than that everyone was professional. We stayed 4 days and had to call the front desk to request toilet tissue Kleenex additional towels etc. because housekeeping was limited during Covid but the room cost didn‚Äôt change. They will charge you for just opening the bar in your room (I had them to remove the charges because we didn‚Äôt take anything out of it) just be sure to check your receipt at checkout.
40,Our stay at Caesars Palace was pleasant the room was great we paid a little extra to upgrade and so worth it! The wait to check in was extremely long and we needed toilet paper since there were no extra rolls and trying to call the front desk to get more was a joke we were on hold forever and still never spoke with anyone. My husband ended up having to text them but because the room was in my name they wouldn‚Äôt send the TP unless they spoke to me first. We finally had to chase down the maid in the halls for an extra roll.
40,I loved the service of the people and the rooms were nice as well I also love the location it was close to everything and in the walking distance of everything this is my second time coming and it was my first vacation ever I would love to come back every year.
50,I believe that an impression begins from the first experience to the last experience. So with that said this is my experience about our stay with Caesars Palace. This was our first trip to Vegas but not our last. We checked in to the hotel and was very impressed with the CHECK IN service. The hotel is a beautiful resort. We were impressed with the cleanliness and all the amenities the hotel had to offer. The casinos were great ( I didn‚Äôt win any money) but I enjoyed them. However the last impression counts just as much as the first. My wife and I along with relatives CHECKED OUT about 2:45am on July 292021 due to having an early flight home. There were three agents at the main desk at the time. The agents were working with other guest and we waited in line for our turn in line (approximately 30 minutes). The following is my last impression of Caesars: When I / we reached the front of the line two of the agents looked at us and just left their posts and went into the back. This action caused me and my relatives to look at each other and wonder what was going on. I hate to play the or any race card but we are African American and all the front desk agents were white or from Middle Eastern dissent. It was just something that made us go ‚Äúhmmmm‚Äù what‚Äôs going on here ?? Why did they leave with us and others in line ? Well after waiting an additional 15 minutes the remaining agent who was very nice took care of our check out.  This is when we noticed the other agents returning to their posts. Another ‚Äúhmmmmm‚Äù moment. So if you would ask me would be be coming back to Las Vegas in the future? Yes we will. Would you book your stay at Caesars? Hmmmm not sure due to my/ our experience from beginning to END.
10,I booked a Augusta suite and the entire treatment by front desk was rude. The room was ok but the tub was falling apart. The outside of tub was falling off the bottom. My room never was cleaned and I had to call to get towels. The woman at the front desk said I should not have left the privacy hanging in door which I did not do. She was rude and put me on hold to get me housekeeping. I did receive my towels which I guess I should be thankful for. I have never been talked down to by a hotel front desk before. I am due to go back in September however I will be looking at a different property that has better customer service and rooms that are not falling apart.
20,We booked this hotel originally in 2020 for our 25th anniversary but Covid shut everything down so we rescheduled this year. Everything started out well check in was smooth and the room was very nice. There was no explanation of housekeeping restrictions or instructions on Sunday at arrival. Our room was clean and ready for occupancy. The following day (Monday) we returned midway to break from the heat and our trash was emptied towels changed and bed made. Tuesday no trash removal or towels. Tried calling every option for housekeeping assistance or guest assistance after waiting on the phone for 20 minutes my husband was able to find a housekeeping attendant and grab towels. Wednesday no trash removal or towels. Can‚Äôt call housekeeping because they don‚Äôt answer. Trip to the front desk results in an apology from the manager on duty offer to have someone empty overflowing trash and change out towels also we will be refunded our resort fee for the inconvenience. We return to our room 3 hours later and the trash was removed a bag of multiple small bags of toiletries for guest rooms (8 to be exact) huge clear trash bags also. No towels or washcloths. It is now 10pm and we have a 4am car to the airport but we STILL cant shower. Another trip to the front desk only to be told that because of Covidhousekeeping will not enter occupied rooms. Okay‚Ä¶.why did we get service on Monday? Maybe someone should have explained that at 6pm instead of 10pm? We received 2 towels and washcloths at 10:40pm so we could shower after being out all day in 105 degree heat and nap before our flight home. Bottom line is it is a beautiful facility but if you are expected to go all week with no fresh towels or washcloths inform your guests at check in!
20,Check in line was 1 hour(picture attached). All hours of the day the line was wrapped around with no self check in. Room keys stopped working 3 times. MOLD and BLOOD on walls and bathtub. Phone not working to get help. Terrible stay. Never again
50,Hotel was gorgeous so many things to do without having to leave variety of great food and gambling options. The staff was friendly and I loved having the options to check out online or on the tv. Visited Paris and would‚Äôve stayed there too but caesars is iconic for a reason.
30,Stayed at Caesar‚Äôs Palace July 21-26. The hotel is beautiful but has some flaws. I was given a room in the Octavius tower on the 65th floor. The room was beautiful and maybe a little dated. When I walked in the smell of old smoke was obvious. Smelled as if someone had been smoking in this room for years (this was a non smoking room). I tried calling guest services several times but could not get through. We had a show and dinner so couldn‚Äôt stay on the phone. The following day i went to the front desk and asked to change rooms. I was told by the manager at the desk that they would not be changing my room and only spray it with a mask. She could use some customer service lessons. When i went back to the room it still smelled like smoke. Second complaint is that s previous guests item (used douche) under my sink sling with a box of other used ones. Disgusting! And the sitting chair has s funny stain in the middle. My stay could have definitely been better. Had I waited on the phone or line in the lobby for hours I could have changed rooms. But time is too precious to waste.    See your review ¬ª
30,Stayed 2 nights only good thing was the bed which was comfortable. The couch had a big rip in it several places on the walls had holes bathroom was clean but just 2 big towels  1 hand towel and 3 wash cloths. Two of the elevators had broken marble tiles leaving wholes which they covered with mats. The handle bars around the elevators were missing. Several people tripped on mat going in. I would say for their pricing the rooms were sub par not what you expect at Ceasers.
10,They told me they upgraded my room I would hate to have seen the non upgraded room. It was on the 14th floor of the Julius tower wow dirty stained cigarette burns everywhere. The topper was the roof was leaking in the hallway near the elevator they threw a towel on it and that was it omg. Then they never cleaned the room we were told you have to ask in order to have your room clean that's what they told us very disappointing.
10,Our room had a broken bathroom door which i could not close and had to call maintenance. Our shower drain was clogged and while taking a shower the would not go down the drain which was very unsanitary. I also had to call maintenance in that issue but they did not fix the shower drain. I hope they contact their vendor soon and fix the clogged shower drain in room 777.
20,Day 1 long check in lines. Wait time was 1:15 minutes to complete check in. Thoroughly surprised that Ceasers is now charging for parking space. Had to pay for parking stay on 1st day and it is not cheap! Also furniture is VERY outdated plenty of wear and tear visible on furniture. Ohhhh also broken sink door.    Day 2 had to call house keeping for shampoo conditioner soap and towels. Items are not refurbished on a daily basis per front desk. Reason being short on staff and covid precautions. House keeping is available when requested.    Day 3 check out was a challenge kiosk check in/out where not working when checking out. Had to check out in the front desk. This time i only waited 15 minures -vs- 1:15 minutes for check in.    Pool experiance was great!
50,We love Ceasars Palace our Stay is always nice Caesars just seems to do it right. However this time was a bit of a miss. Not only for us who stood in the palace towers but for my cousins who stood in the Augusta towers. I understand everywhere is short of staff. No housekeeping which I did not mind. Just Deliver clean towels to my room every day or enough for my five days stay. When I talk to my cousins they said they were having the same issue and another tower..Hopefully the issue with towels will be resolved soon.
20,"The best part of my stay was the bed. It started with the check-in process which took well over an hour as the service staff all congregated with one group that was having an issue. They did not open additional stations to help the massive line of people nor open the express check-in kiosks. When I was finally at the front I was told I would be upgraded to a nicer room with a view for the inconvenience. Great! Or so I thought. The ""view"" was literally of a granite wall with two dingy pipes. That's it. The room REEKED of cigarettes someone had clearly been smoking heavily in the room. In an attempt to counter it the cleaning staff must have just doused the room with lysol. What a great aroma combination. Since I wasn't in my room until nearly 2am it wasn't worth the effort to request a room change. I thought I'll get a good rest then have a nice cup of coffee and deal with it in the morning. But... no coffee in the room! Come on. You can't set up a Keurig then not have at least 1 pod available for your guests. This was not the stay I was hoping for when I came to the infamous Caesars Palace."
20,Wth happened to Caesars? The class and prestige associated with this property are gone!!! I upgraded to a clogged sink two days without housekeeping long front desk lines and zero customer service‚Ä¶‚Äùthank you for letting us know‚Äù was the reply‚Ä¶how about fix the problem that I‚Äôm paying for?!? Room key leaving parking didn‚Äôt work creating long lines leaving garage when everyone else is buzzing the assistance line. Homeless hanging out on your lawn throwing trash cars is not a good look. You definitely need to get THIS in check. Couldn‚Äôt believe your property allowed people passed out taking naps on the resort grounds CLASSY! Overpriced rundown no customer care‚Ä¶never again!  PS. The pool and Bacchanal Buffet were amazing. Staff was very friendly and service was on point at both. Disappointed no military discount in a military town.
50,Xavier at the front desk was truly top notch. We rolled up at 11:45pm probably his hundredth check in of the day but he treated like VIPs really took the time to answer our questions and accommodate our requests.    Room was clean and well laid out.
20,We had high hopes for our stay here but we‚Äôre left disappointed. Here are some of the pros. The location is great there are a lot of really great restaurants in this hotel. And the bell check people were great! The cons out weighed the pros. We were there 6 days and they cleaned our room ONCE! And that was AFTER we called down to the front desk asking for more towels. And were told they were too busy to clean all the rooms. It also took them hours to bring us extra towels it was 11pm! There is no fridge to keep water cold. It is so hot in Vegas and water is a MUST! The customer service was rude when you asked for a basic need. The shower took like 20 mins to get hot water and once you did it just dribbled through no real water pressure. Look for another hotel‚Ä¶
10,Caesars Palace is a maze with horrible signs directing you in the wrong direction. There was so much walking just to get from the parking structure to the room no lie about 2 miles from start to finish. I hated this place & will NEVER stay here again! The staff was rude didn‚Äôt care about customer service & everything was crazy expensive. You can‚Äôt get room service either. Like others said getting a coffee took forever the lines were too long. Asked for double beds got a king.
10,I am a Diamond Plus Reward Card Holder. Lets all understand and agree that gaming money built Las Vegas and it needs gaming money to continue to flourish.  Instead of driving in from California I will be going to the California Indian Casinos. The odds are better and larger gamers are treated well. Caesars closed all the Laurel Lounges and we have to stand in line with Drink Vouchers. The Buffet at Caesars was totally booked for the entire weekend prior to my arrival and my gaming status could not get me in . I am sure the tables were all prebooked by nongamers. It was impossible to get a reservation for dinner at any restaurant at Caesars and I was told to eat at another Caesars property. Not that the result would have been any different. I will NEVER stay here again. Also the food court has lines an hour long at ALL hours. So does Starbucks. Late at night nothing is open. This resort is supposed to be 24/7. I might try the Rio again. But no other Caesar's property. The merger with the Doral has been a disaster. The Doral in Reno is awful. Now that Harrah's closed which was by far the best place in Reno there is no where to stay in Reno that is decent. I predict gaming revenue will decline and this chain will get worse and worse. The gamers need to be treated like gold - and if not we are gone.
10,"This property is as unclean as it is inhospitable. After 4 days of no housekeeping (requested and ignored daily) I took my own garbage to the front desk to dump in a barrel. Had the displeasure of meeting Krista Valle a ""customer service"" manager who made it very clear she could care less about the guest experience and explained that it was impossible to maintain even a minimum standard of service attheir current staffing level while also passing the blame onto the housekeepers being poorly trained. For a hotel advertising that its team is trained on hygieneduring Covid this was completely unacceptable. She never once seemed concerned just cold and apathetic like the rest of the front desk staff. Apparently I shouldn't expect trash removal and towels for a $5000 stay; I got to dry off for 2 nights with a washcloth since I couldn't get any new towels when I requested them!    Also the dead rotting bird mentioned in some other reviews was still there for my entire stay will probably be there for the holidays at this rate.    $51 per day resort fee is a ripoff there isn't even coffee in the rooms and even basic services come with egregious fees.    The casino has a major problem with beggars harrassing people at the slots for money (one even told me I could spare some cash after looking at my balance on the screen). In typical caesars style no one from their staff cared to assist or follow up.    Bottom line... if you want all the pain of a crime laden big city hotel combined with the amenities of a bankrupt summer camp at Ritz Carlton prices then this is the place to be. Otherwise go somewhere that the staff at least pretends to care."
50,Mehret and Salvador made our check in so painless. they were extremely professional and very kind. They made the stay at Caesars worth it. Their attitudes have really made us return customers. - Nick.
30,The cost of food at Caesars was very disappointing. There was limited choices and it was very expensive. Just be prepared to pay about 40 bucks for a couple of hamburgers and fries. (Not including drinks) The room was large and clean and we had a great time overall....was totally sticker shocked by the cost of the food and want others to be aware. The amenities that we used to enjoy in Vegas (coffee in the room room service etc) seem to be long gone. I expected more from this establishment.
50,We always stay in Ceasar but this trip was disappointing. This trip started off bad. We booked a non smoking room and our room was filled with weed smoke. We were promised the rooms to be connected inside which we also didn‚Äôt get. It was next door but not connected. Then we got moved next day which was great. At check out we were charged upgrade for our rooms which we were told we weren‚Äôt. Spoke to operator and we were told to see VIP HOST we waited 30 minutes in line to only be told to go to front desk. At front desk we waited another 39 minutes because nobody know to tell us correctly where to go. The host was rude and short like she didn‚Äôt want to take care of us.
10,OMG. I remember when Caesar‚Äôs Palace was the most elegant casino on the strip - that is now something only in the past. Here is what you can expect. Management that absolutely could care less about your experience. They are rude apathetic and burned out. You can only blame Harrah‚Äôs top brass for running their properties using a bottom line strategy. During our stay we did not get any housekeeping service until we spent hours arguing with front desk managers that it actually was important to have clean towels. The managers hide in their offices to avoid angry and frustrated guests. If you try calling the operator front desk or anyone they just keep playing a recording till they wear you out and you hang up. At checkout they tried denying us our credits that American Express gives you for staying there. The Casino is dirty and smells like vomit. The rooms also have a fowl odor of sewage. It‚Äôs a nightmare in every regard. Do yourself a favor and stay away.
20,I was trying to check out at 10:45 am with a phone  been hold for 10 min. So I tried general guest service they advised me to use TV . It didn't work showing the message checking out from loby. Again I called no one answered in 20 min. No choice but went to check out line at front desk. Line was long. so I tried express check out machine again didn't work. Once I reached to real person to check out it was after 11:30 am. I casually joked about it. The lady who served me blasted on me saying there were other plenty option to check out showing me the check in line where 50 people waiting. She also mentioned I could just take off. However TV saidI need to check out from the front desk since function was properly working. I couldn't believe the rudness of this lady. They need more training - 5 star hotel? Nope
10,Requested 2 queen beds when making reservation online when we arrived the front desk said they didn‚Äôt have any rooms with 2 beds at our booking price. They had rooms with 2 beds in a different tower but it would be an extra $44 per night!  Ridiculous! Housekeeping never cleaned the room during our entire stay. The only time housekeeping even tried was the morning of checkout. Even earlier then checkout time! Everything here is VERY EXPENSIVE. Restaurants are only open on certain days and lines for coffee in the morning are super long. Waiting times even at the bars was way to long!
40,"Stayed at Caesars 7/6/21 to 7/10/21. I am a diamond member and have stayed at Caesars many times in the past as it's my favorite. Got my favoirite room a Palace Premuim Studio whcih is far back in the hotel by the pools. I know it's quite a long walk to the casino but I love the room. Since I do have some trouble walking i need to sit down every once in a while. Caesars has decided to start construction on their entrance and has moved the cab line to way out by the road!!! There are no benches to take a break. It is a LONG walk from the room to the cab line!!!! One of the bellmen said they were supposed to ""walkie"" a cab and let them come closer to the front of the hotel but that only happened once in 4 days! I love Caesars but won't stay there again until construction is over."
50,This was the first time my husband and I stayed at Caesar‚Äôs Las Vegas. You feel like royalty when you walk inside. When we stepped up for check in we were greeted by Emma Morhn. She wore a big smile and asked us how we were doing. We were thrilled to be in Vegas. She checked us in quickly and answered every question we had with courtesy. I wish more hotels has Emma‚Äôs on this staff. She was the very best! We will be back but only if Emma is there to check us in! -The Hamilton‚Äôs from CA
50,What can I say? This place is a palace. From check in to check out we never have any issues when staying here. The pools are beautiful and we‚Äôve used them all. We got married here 10 years ago in their Juno Garden and it‚Äôs the most beautiful hotel to stay at. We stayed in an Augustus Junior Suite which was bigger than the standard rooms and we had a great view of not only the pools but the strip as well. The tub in the bathroom was great to soak in morning or night after being on our feet all day. We dined at the Americano Cafe Hells Kitchen the pizza spot in the food court and the buffet. No complaints whatsoever. The Apollo pool is quieter and we used this pool for our second day since we wanted to relax a bit more. The drink service from Chris at the bar by the swim up blackjack was perfection. Check out was super easy and we were able to do it right from our cell phones instead of waiting on the long lines of incomers and check out guests. We will be back in August to meet up with family and again staying at Caesars because it literally is that great of an experience for us. We are truly treated like Caesars here and appreciate the above and beyond by staff.
20,The worse room service ever. We have been coming to Caesar for years and have always been satisfied. This time we couldn‚Äôt be more disgusted with housekeeping.  We got to our room Sunday evening tired after a 5 hours flight and 6 hour delay. We took a shower and left the room. Next morning I tried to make coffee in the room but there was no coffee and I noticed the desk was very dirty and sticky. I took wipes and cleaned it up. Took a shower and left for the day. When we came back at night the room was the same. Bed was not made dirty towels on the floor garbage was not picked up and there were no extra towels We called housekeeping snd got a automated answer saying leave your phone number for fastest service. They did text but couldn‚Äôt speak to a person. We waited over 1/2 an hour for towels and nothing. After almost an hour and 3 phone calls finally someone dropped a plastic bag with towels and toiletries we requested. No time to speak to the person or anything.  Next morning I decided to open the drawers to arrange my clothes and found lingerie on a plastic bag in the drawer. Seriously? Did anyone even bother to clean the room before we arrived?  Completely unacceptable and unhygienic. Don‚Äôt say because of Covid Because of Covid even more reasons to keep everything clean
20,"I was really looking forward to our stay. We had been waiting over 18 months for our family gathering. After the warm arrival in Las Vegas we looked forward to cooling off in our room. Unfortunately the AC was not working properly. I had to address this problem FIVE different times. Attempts to fix the AC did not resolve the issue. I was offered another room however not a room equal to what I had reserved. They did remove the Resort Charges which covers the internet for 2 devices. At these prices for a ""Junior Suite"" the majority of other top hotels include the internet. Caesars has a lot to offer but the hotel did not provide an explanation of the facilities - different types of pools bars restaurants etc. It was Not worth the money you spend to stay here. Paying for the name - not for the quality you expect. Spend your money somewhere else where they appreciate your business."
20,"First Eric at VIP (on the way to the Octavius Tower) was great. He went above and beyond to help us and did what he could to try make our stay salvageable. He deserves praise and a bonus and/or promotion.    Unfortunately the rest of our stay here at Caesar's palace was disappointing to such an extent that we'll never stay here again.    Significant problems were apparent right from the time we arrived. The valet and bell hop service was very slow and very casual. We were not greeted pleasantly or addressed respectfully. We were treated more like cattle being herded than guests. The arrival services seemed to be very understaffed and unprofessional and untrained with regard to guest services.    When we got inside we weren't directed where to go or told what our options for check in were. We were simply funneled to an ""express"" check-in that was anything but ""express"". The kiosk feature is designed to save the hotel money by making the guests do their own checking in. It just feels cheap and cold. Also we arrived at 4:30 p.m. but we were told that our.room was still being cleaned ... but that wasn't true ... when an actual person came to verify that he cleared it up ... but that kind of defeats the point of doing it yourself. The process really just slows everything down and is frustrating.    Then when we finally figured out where our tower was located we had to walk a very long distance from the valet...VERY LONG. It was even more than a football field from the usual curbside check in (which is not the curbside check in anymore) and from the entrance (also not the traditional front entrance anymore). On top of the distance to the tower is the fact that the hallway smelled like a broker sewer pipe ... seriously bad ... so bad in fact that we renamed this place ""crappers palace"".    Then...yeah...there's more...when we got into the elevator the buttons for two of the floors were missing (just gone ... like someone stole them) and the elevator info screen / computer had crashes (clearly a computer malfunction that must have been dangerous to passengers). So we had to ride up and down the elevator to get to our floor.    Theeeen...yep...there's more...when we got to our room the room was weathered and old and not taken care of. The facades of the bathroom cabinets were wearing off and ... get this...the big draw of the room (the jacuzzi tub) had two jets that were broken. Yeah...they just didn't work.    CONCLUSION: SKIP Caesar's."
10,It is practically impossible to actually make contact with a human being in this facility. But more importantly I waited for almost an hour on the phone just to make transportation arrangements‚Ä¶ They have an artificial intelligence application they want you to interface with however that application through text messages direct you to their app on your phone which then captures lots of data‚Ä¶ And simply pushes you to other services. I‚Äôm sure they make a margin of profit from each of the services they push you to.    The lack of human contact is really something that is odd and unacceptable for those over 25 years old. I am used to being able to speak with a human.    Even asking for extra pillows or towels was a bit of a torture. Nobody made up our room‚Ä¶ And only after waiting on the phone for over an hour was a porter able to show up and basically drop a plastic bag containing bedsheets in our room. But bedsheet is not what I asked for. Simply wanted towels.    Room service was just as bad. Everything that was on the ‚Äúmenu‚Äù which was posted on the television was not available. And could not be ordered. They have not integrated their technology On the television screen to their application. Dessert menu on the television didn‚Äôt exist in reality.    A quarter mile walk to the taxi cab in order to get to the airport. And that was only because no one could get us ground transportation.
50,My wife and I traveled to Caesars Palace for the Usher Residency. It was an excellent experience from start to finish. I highly recommend staying at this hotel above most others in Vegas for the aesthetics alone.
20,My wife and I stayed at this hotel from 7/15-18/2021 and it was very unsatisfactory. We had to deal with toilets constantly running without lifting the top to stop it. We had horrible internet service even after telling the front desk about this issue several times. We asked to have turndown service each night and only had it once. We paid for early check-in and was told we would have a room by 11am - our room was not available until 2:30pm - this was a work trip for me and I had to visit the business center where noise was too loud and mass amount of people coming in and out. I will not visit this hotel ever again.
20,I would have given terrible rating but that would have been unfair to others in the hotel service. I was at the hotel (first time at this hotel) for a wedding and we ( me and my wife) booked a room well in advance ( over a month) for 2 nights (Fri & Sat). The rate was not cheap (about $300 per night) and when we went to check-in at 3:30 we were advised check-in was at 4pm. I didn't think that was a problem as gordon ramsey pub was right next to lobby check-in. We got some drinks and something light to eat. After awhile I went back to desk (around 4:45) and was told room was still not ready but we could have a room with 2 double beds instead of a king really! If I wanted a double that's what I would have booked so they said they would rush to have room ready shortly so back to bar we went. At 6:15 and full of drink and short of money (for all the drinks bought) was told room was not ready but that they would put a rush on it really I was told that at 4:45 I said I wanted to talk to manager. The manager didn't come out initially and the desk clerk again offered a double bed room frustrated I demanded the manager come talk with me. After waiting another 10 or so minutes the manager comes out and says the room is now ready. Instead of venting I thought the alcohol I had consumed would cloud my judgement so instead of saying something I might regret later I took key and went to the room. When it was time to check-out my wife called the front desk to see if we could get a late check-out (seemed to be a fair request considering the check-in issue) was told there would be a extra charge for that. OMG really!!! This was the first time at caesars as we normally stay at other casino's I can say I will not be going back to caesars anytime soon
10,hotel not ready no housekeeping service had to re use towels for 2 days. called housekeeping to 20 minutes for someone to pickup. they promised the room would be serviced. no one ever came.    could not get anyone on the phone for transportation. the entire stay was bad
10,It started with a 35 minute check-in then a 20 minute wait for a elevator (only two working). Room had a bad mildew smell like they sprayed to get rid of a smoke odor. Rooms are dated with very old furniture and sinks that don‚Äôt drain. My electric blinds won‚Äôt open. I will never come back to this place!!
40,Registration was made simple using the express kiosk and the registration desk staff were helpful during the process. Had a good time. Would highly recommend using their TOTAL EXPERIENCE group planning the price was right. Thank you to our sales person Sheri ..and our event coordinator Erin.
40,The hotel was very good. Staff was friendly and helpful. My coffee maker in room did not work. We were very shocked on how expensive everything was. Room rates were great. getting food was always waiting in line same with coffee. Meeting cars that were picking us up was confusing because everyone had a different name for each place. Biggest complaint was that slots were very tight didn't even win small jackpot there we ended up going elsewhere.
40,We went to Vegas to get married. For the most part our stay was great. We were in the Augustus Tower. It was close to the main area so we weren't having to walk a mile to get to the Casino. The room sizes are great and the bathrooms are wonderful. The frustrations we had were that in our room the A/C wasn't working we would call down but everything is through text. I text them but the response was 4 hours later that they would respond to head to the room but we weren't there as we were out and about. The prices for drinks/food is about the same here as everywhere else on the strip EXPENSIVE. But it was a great time!
30,I was disappointed that my stay at Cesars Palace was not good. The check-in process was smooth and the room was nice but the other things that I expected to be in place were not. My room did not get cleaned during my entire stay. When I called to inquire about it I was told that they were short staffed and that they were busy getting rooms ready for new guests. We had to request fresh towels and empty our own trash! Oh and I had to call several times and was on hold for a while before someone answered. I did complain and was given a credit on my bill but I would have preferred to get the service that I expected instead. As hot as it is in Las Vegas during this time of year you would think that the rooms would have a refrigerator that can be used by guests but they don‚Äôt. The ones in the rooms are fully stocked with their items that they want you to purchase. The hours for the pool end at 6:00 pm. I would have thought that they would be extended especially since it doesn‚Äôt get dark until well after 8:00. It was still very hot! I will stay there again!
40,We read a lot of bad stuff so we were expecting long check in lines but we checked in at the kiosk in five minutes. Was disappointed by the small room and terrible view but all in all it wasn‚Äôt bad. We didn‚Äôt get housekeeping or towels the first day but we were supposed to. I called and they brought towels right up at 2:30 am. Concierge service was through text and made it very easy to do a late check out (at a price) but then we decided to stay another night and this made it very easy to do.
30,Wanted to get away for the weekend with friends and they all decided to stay at Caesars for a concert in the Colosseum. We stayed in the Forum Towers which are the older tower. It was clean and average. If you just want to lay your head somewhere this may be the spot for you but this tower is not worth the price I paid. Everything in Vegas relative to prices is high right now. They are even charging for parking in different hotels if you are not a guest when it used to be free. There are many things I can‚Äôt list that the prices are elevated now. I think everyone is trying to make up for loss wages during the pandemic. The hotel is excessively crowed. Everyone is trying to travel. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated but I decided to wear my mask because of the excessive crowd. I recommend washing your hands and hand sanitizer is located everywhere in the hotel. The other towers in the hotel I‚Äôm sure is nice but for the room I stayed in it‚Äôs like staying at a 3 star hotel. Hope this helps. By the way I recommend arriving at the Las Vegas airport to depart 3 hours early. Security and check-in lines are out the door at the airport.
30,The room which we paid to have a view of Garden of the Gods was amazing! However I have two major complaints about our stay. 1) HOUSEKEEPING....AWFUL.....I set up to have daily service and never ONCE received daily service. I had to call TWICE just to get towels and have our trash emptied out. On the 3rd morning of our visit the housekeeping cart was right outside our door but no one came into our room!!!!! 2) CHECK OUT......POOR SERVICE....Upon trying to check out only two employees were assisting guests. In a line of 25 people that is not acceptable. Taking into acocunt that most of us had to get to the airport there should have been significantly more employees checking out guests. Oh and let me mention that the auto checkout kiosks were NOT WORKING!!!! .
30,Room was very outdated and needed new carpets 100%. But the casino restaurants and especially the buffet were superb. Bed was very comfy. Just wish they‚Äôd update the rooms a bit. Also coffee is not included in the room but they have a Keurig and K cups to buy just to tease!
10,A group of seven of us traveled from Chicago to visit Las Vegas for two nights. We usually stay at Caesar‚Äôs Palace or Bellagio we chose Caesar‚Äôs Palace this time. We reserved a big suite and two enhanced rooms.    When we arrived we noticed a large black creature deceased by our window. A black bird has been decomposing for quite some time (you can tell from the photos). This is absolutely disgusting and highly questionable.    When was housecleaning in here last and does management seriously allow guests to stay in rooms with dead animals on the outside ledge? I understand the bird is laying outside on the ledge and may be hard to reach but were the rooms not checked or cleaned before we arrived? Isn‚Äôt there a code or system for readying the rooms?    I called the front desk yesterday and they told me to go to the front desk to complain. I went to the front desk and told them what was going on during an extremely busy time. They said someone would get back to me but no one has. I called back today but no one has gotten back to me‚Ä¶    I am very disappointed with Caesar‚Äôs customer service and all of us will never stay here again. I hope a ‚Äúlucky‚Äù customer gets my room and sees the beautiful view!
10,We had a family reunion in Las Vegas and decided to select the Caesar Palace because of the prestige well we had a rude awakening. First the mix 3 rooms accounts. My room was given to someone else and their room given to me. That person had keys to enter my room. My room was never serviced had dirty towels ask for more and there were deliver to that other room. Got charge for room service that I never order and at check out I notice the credit card on the account wasn‚Äôt mine and my credit card was under another room. The front desk employee accused me of changing keys and rooms on purpose and had the worst attitude. This is a pretty expensive hotel and definitely I didn‚Äôt get what I paid for. Don‚Äôt recommend it and will never stay again.
10,During our stay of 4 days one of our rooms was cleaned once the other room was not cleaned at all. No new towels were provided. Repeated call to front desk were not answered.    Double charged for WIFI which we never used. Charged for drinks from the mini bar because we removed the hotel drinks and put our drinks to cool. Windows in the room were full of smear.
40,First off I would like to say thank you to Delano at the front desk checking us in. He was very professional and welcoming. He gave a good start to our experience of staying with Caesar Palace. First look in our room was nice and had a decent view. However all the corners that are not on there carpet including the makeup room seems to be the dustpan for the housekeeper. Shower pressure was really low and the pillows were horribly soft I had to triple stack the pillow to make it even possibly acceptable to rest. Caesar palace has everything in it for all budgets whether it is shopping food or entertainment. The pool is the one thing that I feel made it all worth it different atmosphere so many options beautiful.
20,During check in I was informed that a ‚Äúresort fee‚Äù of $51 p/day was mandatory. I asked what the fee was for and was told ‚Äú‚Ä¶gym access local phone calls and WiFi‚Ä¶‚Äù I was then told there would be a $100 p/day for ‚Äúincidentals‚Äù. So I‚Äôm all that was $450 in fees before I even got to see my room which by the way you are not allowed to check in before 4:00 pm! Not only was this distressing but also disappointing. This completely discouraged me from post-Covid travel to Las Vegas indefinitely. The hotel staff member I spoke with literally told me he would ‚Äúnot be going back and forth with you‚Äù while I was trying to tell him that I spoke with management BEFORE I flew to Las Vegas that told me there would be no additional fees. I called several times in order to budget properly. Room/guest services do not answer the phone. We asked to have our room cleaned daily during our four day stay and it was done once (I had to ask one of the housekeepers in the hall for more towels because the front desk never answered the phone). I was under the impression that Las Vegas wanted to see a return of tourists and visitors but the way Caesar‚Äôs Palace is going about jilting people with ridiculous fees it quite off-putting‚Ä¶also it is illegal. This property is in violation of FCC rules by charging any sort of fee for internet usage (I looked it up and brought it to two ‚Äúmanagers‚Äù prior to arriving in Las Vegas). They insisted ‚ÄúYOU MUST PAY!‚Äù I am actually in shock as was in Las Vegas January 2020 just prior to the pandemic. I paid no resort fees. With this trip however I paid fees on to of fees (even more fees at Ceasar entertainment like the High Roller for example). I will NEVER stay at this property much less visit Las Vegas ever again. This was ridiculous over priced and crappy service at its worst.
10,First time did not know where to park how to check in or anything. Staff very rude to first timers who are confused about how to navigate this city of a casino. Restaurants were booked. You cannot call the front desk and no hospitalty
10,The room was nice and spacious but did not get cleaned the 3 days I was there. It was over crowded and over priced. A regular rum drink at the pool is $28!!!! They are short staffed and their prices ridiculous. I won't be back.
50,My wife and I stayed at Caesars Palace from July6th-July10th and it started with an amazing experience. We checked in and Gemma got us into this beautiful room and beautiful view and we just can't thank her enough. She was kind friendly and always maintained her smile. Our whole stay was amazing. The amenities food service table games every team member at Caesars Palace we the most friendly staff I have seen in whole of Las Vegas. Now we will only stay at Caesars. Thank you Gemma you are the best!!!  Regards  Ravi and Mohini.
20,Could not get anyone on the phone there was a whole lime under the bed and a Bobby pin on the nightstand hair in the tub room never cooled off I know they were under staffed but what staff they had was not friendly
10,The worst hotel visit I've ever had. Not coming back to Caesar's again. Way too expensive. Room wasn't cleaned 3 days. Stay away from this hotel. You will regret being at Caesars. Stay away and you'll be much better off.
20,"Our concierge told us we had the ""hangover suite"" booked for our stay while in Vegas for Volleyball trip as well as pleasure. We got there however and were told that unfortunately they had to give our suite (which we booked months in advance) to another high end client who insisted on the same suite and checked in earlier than us. They did move us to another suite but it was VERY dated and nothing like we were promised. Very very disappointing and will not return based on trust alone."
50,It was my first experience in Las Vegas and it was excellent the situation is great in Las Vegas strip near to every thing. The hotel is so big full of restaurants and stores  we were four and our room was very good for us  also the swimming pool was perfect  I really recommend this hotel
20,I would not recommend Caesars Palace when there are so many hotels in much better shape than this (that will not charge $50 to rent a pool chair for the day and $75 to use the fridge in the room to chill a soda or 2). Our mattress was completely worn out on one side so I spent 3 nights sleeping on the ‚Äúdownhill‚Äù side of the bed which was way lower than the other side of the bed. The room was missing a hair dryer which my wife needed and spent an hour or so on the phone trying to attain. They did bring one eventually but took it again when they cleaned the room. She had to spend an hour on hold a second time trying to get it brought back a second time. They are about to start construction of some kind which may help but it has made a mess of doing any kind of Uber/Lyft scenario as they have moved the pick up spot so it can only be reached from one direction on the strip. We had several rides cancel on us because they made the pick-up so difficult for the drivers.
10,Rooms were in horrible shape they charge for lounge chairs $50 a day if you want to sit by the pool no hairdryer in the room asked for five hours to get one the rooms are run down and stinky The bed in our room was so bad and so used and worn out that we didn‚Äôt sleep for three days . there are so many other better places to say inVegas!! we were horribly disappointed! I wish I could say something nice but overall hands down a horrible horrible rundown hotel . I‚Äôm not a hotel snob and we go to Vegas quite a bit we thought we‚Äôd give Caesars a chance.. absolutely horrible in all areas!
10,"Curt bell person Renee.......no Concierge.....Trying reaching the operator for a wake up call....was on for 15 minutes...never got anyone...went to front desk and front desk couldn't get anyone to answer until I requested the front desk manager who was able to accommodate...short staff everywhere and the ""newbies"" were clueless.....very sad....worst experience at a hotel of the 1000+ I have been to over the past 50+ years....no daily service for rooms.....would NEVER go back."
10,Our room was old and dirty. We immediately called and asked for another room and they refused even though we arrived right at check in time. There were plenty of other rooms. We ended up getting bed bug bites all over. Customer service wouldn‚Äôt even address the issue. We also weren‚Äôt given toiletries (I had to call numerous time) and our safe was broken. When you go to Vegas a safe is pivotal!. Every time you call customer service expect to be on hold for about 20 min before you get an answer. There are so many hidden costs and fees and this is my 6th or 7th time staying in Vegas I know what to expect. If I could give it zero stars I would.
10,"First the good part: The hotel's design is fun and the food/bar service workers are very pleasant and attentive.  BUT this hotel has SO much limited service and hidden costs (which you'll learn at checkout). Want to use your in-room coffee maker in the morning? $20 for the Keurig pods. Want to buy a bottle of water in the casino area? $9 (and the price fluctuates UP depending on time of day day of week and outside temperature). Did you make your reservation over the phone? $15 added to your bill. And on and on. The ""resort fee"" (approximately $50 per day in addition to your room charge) is for the fitness center pool wifi and housekeeping. But they don't tell you that the fitness center and pool have very limited hours (and a waiting line to use the pool) the wifi is completely unpredictable in your room and housekeeping might (or might not) show up to change your towels. If none of those things matter to you then this is an acceptable hotel. (By the way the front desk agreed to remove one day of ""resort fee"" charge but then did not do this on the emailed receipt. So now I have to dispute the charge with my credit card company)."
10,What a dump.    One line hour to check in then a $40 early check in fee.    5 nights stay nobody cleaned my room even after asking many times. Kept saying we‚Äôll put you on the list and leaving a bag of towels outside my door.    Illegally might I add Nevada state passed a law in 2020 stating rooms have to be cleaned daily. So this hotel broke state laws.    Day four out of five found a rat in my room in the 4 days old trash bin in my room. Packed my bags and RAN out of this disgusting hotel.    Everything in this hotel is a scam. Stay away don‚Äôt stay here even for free.
50,It was amazing rooms are very clean and the whole party and everything is there in the hotel! We had an amazing time in this hotel. The casino was comfortable a lot of stores to shop and a lot of restaurants to eat at.
20,Room service was slow. It took over 3 hours for our food to be delivered to the room. Guest services for house keeping was poor. Every time we called for more bath towels or toilet rolls and gave them a specific number of how many we need. They always show up with 1 bath towel or 1 toilet roll. It was inconvenient that we had to call again and again for more when we had 4 guest registered for this room. Not staying here again. I had had better experiences with other hotels on the strip.
10,Resort is dirty and showing age. We could smell sewage inside the building. It is impossible to find staff at the resort to answer a question or help solve a problem. Broken buttons damaged facilities 1 star experience. I was incorrectly charged a $150 resort fee that I already paid. I have zero confidence that I‚Äôll ever get someone on the phone to discuss a refund.    Do not stay here.
30,"Currently sitting in my room at Caesars getting kicked off the wifi every 5 minutes on hold with support who ""doesn't see any other complaints about it"" and exhausted from having to walk to my room via a different tower given the elevators in ours are broken. Everything has fees attached to it regardless of whether what your paying for actually works and guests are treated like garbage. Have never stayed at a hotel with such little class. The concierge just responds that they cannot assist with any request not sure why they are there. Honestly so disappointed."
30,Just trying to pull up to check in was a nightmare. We had no idea we'd have to go to self park then go to the check in area. The valet screamed at my husband when he pulled up to drop me at the desk for check in.  I used a self check in machine which (erroneously)said my room wasn't ready. Luckily a desk agent did something on his computer and prompted me to restart the checkin process on the machine and I got a room.  We got to our room our phone and ironing board were both broken. Trying to get more towels took forever as we had to find the right desk and wait for the only person at the desk to help us. The room was ok other than the broken items. The parking was very far from our room and lugging suitcases through a giant crowded casino was awkward at best. There is no one you can ask near self park for a cart or bell service. You have no choice but to drag your stuff across the building. Night swim is extra and requires a reservation which is annoying on nights that are 106 at 1030pm. I would have liked to know in advance instead of seeing a sign. I wish they would include at least one pool for evening swim in the resort fee even if it costs more. I don't mind paying more I just want access. If I was informed in advance I would have booked the night swim. By the time I found out there was no availability. The nickel and dining the lack of communication the lack of service personnel made this trip stressful and not worth the money. My last trip was at Mirage. It's smaller but the service was top notch. That's where I plan to go in the future.
10,A complete disappointment. Was looking to step it up and stay at a top hotel on the strip. I‚Äôm on vacation and make a good living so I don‚Äôt mind spending $ on nice accommodations. Wanted to try the world famous Caesar‚Äôs Palace. Wow - a 100% outrageous rip off. Packed hotel completely understaffed. Couldn‚Äôt get maid service had to beg for clean towels each day (4 days room NEVER cleaned). Fair price for room but then they whack you with resort fees each day multiple ‚Äúholds‚Äù on credit card for daily incidentals that I had to wait over a week to get released from my credit line. Prices for food and drinks were out of control. Example- in the ‚Äúfood court‚Äù 2 slices of pepperoni pizza and 1 bottle water = $38! Breakfast- 2eggs bacon hash browns = $29.00. Decent chair at the pool - $175 a day. Cheapest drink at pool is $24. They are clearly trying to make up for the months off financial losses during COVID. Go on the strip and watch the people pouring out of CVS with food and cases of beers and going back to the hotel because of the price gouging. Just because I CAN afford to pay these prices doesn‚Äôt make me willing to be gouged at every turn. I have been going to Vegas for 30+ years and the place has CHANGED post Covid. Also the whole strip is full of low life‚Äôs as the whole town smells like pot. Complete waste of $$. Take your paycheck and go to Cabo! I did and loved it the following week.
10,AC was 74! Studio suite - terrible. Waited on hold forever. I expect the best -stayed here 10 tines. It is not the heat. Caesars HAS AC. Help!!!! There is no way this room should be hotter than the lobby. No way to get room cooler. Engineering has not been a help. Major PROBLEM.
10,To start off our trip there was no bell staff available for 20 minutes and there WAS NOT a line.  Finally I was told there were no wheel chairs available and the bell staff said that was not their job.  I did not take that for an answer and finally received a wheel chair only to be stuffed on the far side of the complex after asking to be as near as possible to an exit due to having an injured companion.    I ended up having to extend my trip longer than intended and spent the rest of my time at ARIA.
50,The best part of our Caesars stay was the check in. Kyle Jackson checked us in and it was the most friendly and helpful check in process we have ever had! She took an interest in us and made us feel welcomed. She answered all of our questions and it was a pleasure to meet her. Throughout our week we even tried to see if we could spot her as we walked past the check in area to just say hello.
10,I hope that the impersonal treatment was a factor of being incredibly understaffed. For the five nights I was here my room was cleaned only once. The reason given was that they didn't get to it. If you don't have the staff to clean rooms then let guests know.
10,Our room was disgusting it smelled like dirty sweaty locker room the moment you entered. Engineering came to change the air filter as if that would rid the smell. Housekeeping came the following day to spray air freshener and disinfectant which did nothing. We stayed in a smelly dirty room for 3 days. ‚ÄúIvy‚Äù the personal concierge is a joke. Requesting fresh linens and a room cleaning took forever and they just dropped a comforter and 2 pillows at the foot of our bed they didn‚Äôt even bother to clean or make the bed. The pool was out of towels all day! Not sure what the 41.95 daily resort fee was for since the pool barely had any seating and no towels. Such a disappointing and disgusting stay
10,I stayed at Ceaser's. As usual I gave them my credit card to cover incidental expenses. I was shocked when I received my bill where they charged me $364 for using the mini bar. Given the prices that the mini bar has I and my family did not even touch it! Multiple emails elicited no response and phone calls never reached a human to speak to.
10,Was having a great time  housekeeping missed our room no biggie I went to front desk just asked for some towels and toiletries to get cleaned up. Front desk was great had everything sent up gave us a credit for the night. To my surprise without any notice Caesars charged my Credit Card $750.00 when I inquired about the charge Caesars Housekeeping said we tampered with the fire detector . This is a crazy accusation my wife and I are both senior citizens and have absolutely no reason nor desire to damage or tamper with anything.
30,"The best thing about staying at Caesar's... the fact that it's famous!  Prices on everything is outrageous. They have a 4pm check-in so naturally nothing else to do either take your luggage to the casino or go have lunch at the Americana. Only if you want to spend $125 for lunch for 3 people. (Nachos fish n chips tacos). pretty much cheapest things on the menu. Shouldn't have been anything expensive. Soda/tea are $6 each small glasses waiters put out for doing refills. Transportation options - Good if you use valet or limo. If you're a normal person and you Uber or Taxi good luck. They hate Uber there. Make guests walk 2 blocks to get to a 'designated"" uber location. Caesar's street workers are SO RUDE to everyone! Uber drivers guests etc. I was shocked at being flipped off by the workers after we finally got an Uber. Have to wait 15-30 mins on drivers because Caesar's changes the Uber pick up routes so often keeps the drivers confused. Rooms were accommodating not anything like I expected. The view from the room was OK could see the fountains from a distance. Clean. mini fridge really small stocked with all liquors. They force all common folks to use one pool. The other pools are reserved for rich and famous or those who pay for/reserve cabanas. and they really throw you out too. If I go back to Vegas I'll stay at a regular hotel and visit casinos instead."
10,Pros: Room is excellent if you spend entire time there  Cons:Did not receive room booked or offered upgrade  Can't get through phone lineswifi was exceptionally awful we were in Octavius Tower  Cabana rental disappointing Paid 1800 and had limited food options with 2 choices of beer at 10am on 4th of July. Was told at check in no outside food allowed. Then had to go get food outside since decent food could not be provided by resort. Their options equate to what you can get at CVS. Paid gratuity at booking cabana but required to tip manager and wait staff when leaving by 5pm as pool closes at this time. Not a staff issue. Leadership issue. Spent an hour trying to get food outside of pool after they realized their menu was insufficient and their own fault. Hey but the tequila shots are strong so if you find yourself in this predicament just have a few!  TVs are outdated and can not order room service through there. Have to go online and attempt at getting wifi connection.  Come prepared to put down the resort fees for your stay plus additional $500 deposit. Tons of unprepared checkins that hold up check in line with the 2 lone staff members working up front.  Uber pickup location was changed without warning and we almost missed dinner reservations. Unless you walk everywhere or drove valet they will not inform you of changes and calling down is a waste of time if you get through at all.  The exceptional service expected from such a resort as Ceasers was lacking. We will not stay again. we travel yearly sometimes multiple times a year. We spent atleast 5k overall just at Ceasers because at that point we had no choice. Will not make that mistake again.
50,Thank you so much to Grace for the service during our stay. Our whole stay was perfect and she went above and beyond to make sure all our needs were met can‚Äôt wait to visit again and see her! The room was spacious and beautiful the view was phenomenal and we felt like VIPs from check in to check out. Will absolutely recommend friends and family to stay at the caesars palace in the future. Thank you so much again Grace for giving us the best experience we could ask for!!
10,From never receiving our food after 90 minutes at the restaurant to the black hair in the tub to the half drunk drinks in the minibar to the empty beer bottles in the closet this place is awful. We left. Grosss
50,My stay at Caesar's Palace was amazing!!!! Daniel Minarsky gave really great customer service for my husband and I which made our trip even that much more amazing. I highly recommend!!! Definitely give Caesars a 10/10!!!
30,Las Vegas feels like covid never existed when you are there. I loved the hotel however it is VERY EXPENSIVE for drinks and food. We stayed on the palace tower suites which was perfect for going to the pool. Very large room with 2 bathrooms. No maid service which is fine because we could always get fresh linen from someone outside the hall way. We rented a cabana one ay at the Venus pool. Its the adult only pool with great music and salt water pool. Book cabanas at least 2 to 3 months in advance to save $100s of dollars. The pools are beautiful and the main pool is fun but does have a lot of kids there. The resort is so big it takes a while to get around. I will not stay there again because of how expensive everything is and how big the place is you can get lost. We had dinner at Joes Steak and Seafood which is located in the forums. The food was amazing and a great dining experience. The location is great to walk right across the street of the Linq and next to the Belaggio for us to walk over to the O show. Overall the stay was amazing and we had a vey memorable time!!! Oh it is hot a heck there during July plan on staying by the pool or inside all the time. We did do top golf as well which was fun just HOT.
10,We had a King bed booked in a room & 2 queen beds booked. Upon check in because we used hotels.com we were given the cold shoulder. No connecting rooms to stay with our adult children but the worst was not giving us the king bed we booked as we have a king bed at home & didn't want to be uncomfortable. We were told we were getting a credit of $30 per night per room & instead got wifi long distance charges that I will call on when we were told 2 devices per room were no charge. They charged us on 1 line that WAS connected. No one came to clean we had to call. No one willing to help. Paid $1800 for a 2 night stay & never once was given the option of giving us Wed 7/7/21 back because our flight was delayed. Overall it was unpleasant. We will stay elsewhere. Hotels.com won't help & Caesears won't help. I called both the Saturday before to confirm & nothing was right.
50,My family trip to the Caesars Palace was made way better because of the help of Daniel Minarsky great customer service he went above and beyond to make sure we had a better room and made are family trip special!!! Thanks Daniel.
10,Stayed at Caesar‚Äôs for July 7-11 2021. I‚Äôm a Palace tower. Hotel has gone done hill. 45-47 degrees Celsius during our stay. AC barely working in the room. Three calls to get maintenance up and all they did was switch out the filter. Did not adequately resolve the problem. Despite multiple calls and requests to have room cleaned they only came in one. Actually ran out of toilet paper at one point during our stay. Expected a lot more out of this resort. Definitely would NOT recommend.
50,Everything was just nice all around nice rooms nice gust service room service food service front desk bell desk everything all the staff was nice no attitudes they ungraded my room for no uncharge pool was nice and I was able to extend my stay for $60 since my flight wasn‚Äôt til 10 at night
10,- [ ] Let me preface this review by mentioning that I‚Äôm an experienced world traveler. I have stayed at many hotels and resorts. Caesars Palace in Las Vegas by far is the worst. I don‚Äôt want to waste much time on this so I will be brief. We arrived close to midnight. There was a huge line for registration. Kiosks did not work. Only 2 people behind desk. Wait was about an hour. I asked for a supervisor. Katie McMunn was on duty. She was arrogant and condescending. She also called security goons to attempt to intimidate me. There was practically no housekeeping throughout the prepaid 5 night stay. Bed was made only once. No management to complain to unless you wanted to wait another hour on a line. My personal concierge was a robot text message. I have included the messages. I was also charged over $50 for mini bar items that i never used. I find it impossible to call billing to have this taken off. The whole floor reeked of pot and i felt unsafe with my grandkids. I will never be back. Don‚Äôt make the same mistake.
10,I have been to Las Vegas many times and have stayed at many hotels. This was my first time staying at Ceasar's Palace and I was not impressed.  We arrived on Monday night around 12am Vegas time (midnight).  There were approximately 11 people standing in line before us and around 4-5 people checking people in. I thought we would fly through check in and be able to get some sleep.  We were in line for at LEAST an hour. I have no idea what was happening while people were checking in but the staff would talk to them for a few moments and then disappear behind the wall for anywhere between 5 and 15 (yes 15!) minutes while people just stood and waited. We started cheering each time a new person was able to move ahead in line to talk to a person. The line moved painfully slow the staff seemed unmotivated to move at an appropriate pace and I still have NO idea what they were doing each time they left guests standing at the counter while staff disappeared.  Our room was in the Augustus tower which looked fine in the public spaces. Our room showed its age with stained carpet marked up walls a broken shower hinge dust on the vents and a broken light bulb. We stayed 4 nights and did not get fresh towels or sheets once. They said it was not possible due to COVID but i feel they are just terribly short staffed.  The pool was not well marked and was a maze to get to the directions to the Uber area was wrong and led you around the outside of the building and down a tunnel instead of through the hotel.  The bright spot was the pool which was refreshing and calm on a Wednesday morning. It was a great way to relax before hitting the 115 degree heat on the strip.  It is NO way worth the over $50 per DAY resort fee at all. Not even close.    Overall this stay was far less than ideal and I am sure it is due to being shortstaffed but man this experience was not great. I would find somewhere else if I were you at least until it is up and running more smoothly.
10,Restaurants and room service close at 10:00pm  Room water tastes like salt water. During  117 degree weather someone came into our room and turned the AC off. Rooms are outdated. We will never make this mistake again.
30,There is a lack of quality and customer service in major areas. This is my 2nd trip this year and although I early check in online before arriving to the hotel - each time I arrive the system states my rooms not ready and I will receive an email when it is. Not acceptable when I arrive at 10pm. And they unexplainably put a much higher hold on my credit card and charged a higher resort fee each then stated on website and what i was told at check in.    They don‚Äôt answer the phones for service requests so text to Ivy. Well Ivy sucks!! After one night stay the TV wouldn‚Äôt turn on i had to put in a service request. One hour later I received a call stating my room was ‚Äòuninhabitable‚Äô and I was being upgraded to a nicer room. That was weird but I appreciated it.    However I left a couple of items in the old room safe. Tried using Ivy it made me fill out a lost item report. No one answers the phones so i had to go to the front desk to get access and collect my items.    Lastly I was really looking forward to sipping delicious frozen cocktails poolside. What I received for $35 was a syrupy and watery melted concoction - straight nasty. I asked the bartender could he add more ice to make slushy short answer- no.    I don‚Äôt know if I will ever stay at Caesars again.
20,Super 8 Hotels have better room service and they even have frig for the customer and not the owner.  3 people in our room and had to call down daily for toilet paper Towels Wash Clothes etc.  Only 2 phones allowed on WIFI and it kicked you off all the time that I ended up over using my minutes to communicate with my family.
20,The pool was nice with a comfortable relaxing atmosphere and the food was always good but there were quite a few other parts of the resort lacking. All the hallways smelled like someone had been sick and it hadn‚Äôt been cleaned up our bathroom cabinets were warped and the headboard on the bed was shredded. Besides the pool area and the sports book it kind of just felt dirty everywhere; not quite what I expected from a place like this.
20,We stayed at Ceasars Palace for 4 nights. The first day our room wasn't cleaned so we assumed no housekeeping. The second day our room was cleaned. I called the front desk to find out what was going on. They told me they were understaffed and only cleaned the rooms when they had staff. She said expect cleaning every other day at the most. For the highest end Caesars property on the strip this is not acceptable. I asked when the Diamond free shows were going to reopen and she said they eere closed because of covid. But I  could by tickets to Abesthie for $149 each. My Diamond card did not work to get in and out of the garsge. Pushed call button for help and parking garage people told me it shows up as Gold card. Been high level diamond for 15 years. Diamond lounges still closed. Everytime we come they change which bars we can use our drink coupons at . Should just be any Caesars bar Slot machines covered in used drink glasses and dirty ash trays for hours. Cocktail service slow when finally offered drinks. Soda vending machine on our floor sold out our entire 4 night stay. Fountain soda not available in food court because of covid yet available at other Caesars properties on strip. Go to Vegas 3 times a year and are done with Ceasars. So disapointing.
10,Room: It looked like someone had thrown up on a couch in our room. The jets in the jacuzzi did not work at all the bulb in the toilet area was burnt out the entire stay. And they did not replenish the t.p.
50,Everything about my vacation was amazing! The resort was beautiful and staff was very friendly and professional. I love the Caesar‚Äôs Reward program and the ability to use it in so many different places. Can‚Äôt wait to stay here again.
10,From parking that is impossible to a toilet flush handle that is falling off this place is a mess. Rooms are poorly maintained. Understaffed in some locations over-staffed in other locations and incompetent and inefficient regardless. Wifi is slower than tethering with phone. Television channels not synched with remote. It is 2pm and still no housekeeping service. Long lines at restaurants with staff who are clearly indifferent; never asked if we wished a second cup of coffee.    Avoid this place.
50,When I visited in 2019 I ran into a few issues. Not only did Caesars make up for the issues they went above and beyond specifically Optimization Manager Nathan Byers. We came over 4th of July weekend to celebrate my parent's 45th wedding anniversary. We were taken care of times 100 with our room quality.    I will be returning to Caesars everytime I visit Vegas and staying at this hotel. Everything was amazing. Thank you Caesars!
30,Service from the moment we set up the reservation was so bad. Called directly to Caesars to set up reservation with joined room & paid extra. Arrived and they had no joined rooms available. They didn't care. They didn't try or even want to make things right. I felt like I was dealing with a Car Salesman. Called Caesars directly and they are not even onsite. They are a service that is terrible. So expensive and the most important aspect...SERVICE...was severely lacking.
10,We booked a fantastic room 2 months in advance to our vacation. Received a confirmation & receipt and was even charged a $1313 deposit to reserve the room‚Ä¶ all fine until 30 hours away from check in time.    We were told the room was no longer available and refused to give a reason why until after about a 3 hours on the phone a manager slipped up and told us we were bumped.    I was expecting a 3500 room and as a consolation they offered me one night free and one night half off ($750 total value). I asked and they have 20+ of the room I reserved and I surly wasn‚Äôt the last to reserve it and I should be entitled to my reservation especially considering the 1300$ down payment.    Besides all my feelings of what I feel I‚Äôm fairly owed; in this scenario Cesars Palace‚Äôs actions were unethical to say the least and one could argue they border-line illegal.  Oxford‚Äôs English dictionary defines bait and switch as such ‚ÄúThe action (generally illegal) of advertising goods which are an apparent bargain with the intention of substituting inferior goods‚Äù .Advertising an affordable suite then saying it‚Äôs not available with 24 hours notice is text book bait and switch. Please deal with a more honorable hotel not those bunch of thieves.  -Bryce Canepa    Cesar‚Äôs Palace if you would like to make this right please give me a call 8059085334‚Ä¶ or I‚Äôll just keep speaking the truth louder and louder.
50,Went to the host office today at 5:45pm to get information on tickets for tomorrow evening to see Chris Angel at Planet Hollywood. When we spoke to the host on duty last evening he indicated if we needed to get tickets for any shows they could assist us. Tonight there was a woman host sitting behind the desk and no one else was there. We explained to her what we were looking to do and her response was ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt do that‚Äù. She then said Chris Angel is not at a Caesar property. We told her he was at Planet Hollywood and in fact it was a Caesar property. She then said okay but we don‚Äôt do that. We explained what the gentleman stated the night before and she just blew us off. As a Seven Stars player this attitude is totally unacceptable. I know it‚Äôs tough getting good help but this woman is a terrible representative for the brand.
20,Hotel looks very nice and clean but Website lacks detailed description photos of any exact room you want to book extra unnecessary charges even for using the fridge difficult to get ride share drivers to your location overall service response was poor.
20,Stayed in Octavius Tower over the 4th of July weekend. I was supposedly given an upgraded room. Well The room needed to be taken out of service. In a word it was in poor condition. head boards on both beds were ripped and torn. Furniture was nicked and marred. sofa was in such deteriorating shape that I would venture to guess that Good Will would reject it. Had to move to a new room in same tower. This is supposed to be the premier property of Harrah's and the Octavius Tower is supposed to be the best tower. A tower that is labeled part of the Lauren Collection. Trust me it is not. Caesar's has gone down the hill in accommodations and service. It should not rate any more than one or two diamonds with AAA.    Stay at Bellagio instead. I was there two weeks ago and ha a pristine and elegant room.
10,I booked my reservation. Way before the vaccination period. When the world was still shot down whe we arrived this past July 2nd  They provide it me with a room totally different.  When I addressed the issue they were suppose to call me and they never did ! When a 2nd time to front desk they were very sarcastic and rude . Nothing change . Never again will stay there
40,The Caesars is a classic.  However there is a lot of competition now in Las Vegas with the new hotels and I wish classic establishments like this will up up their game.    The entertainment factor was not a wow.  the Service was ok.  the Front person upgraded us to a the tower that our friend was staying for an $80 charge saying that the room was almost double the size.  We arrive at a very small room overlooking the parking lot.  this was a false claim.  while we made the best out of crazy busy weekend  i think Caesars can step up their game.
20,We waited over 25 minutes in a Very Long line to check in with only 2 people at the desk at times. Then our room wasn‚Äôt ready but a room ‚Äúcould be found for a $40 fee.‚Äù Miraculously a room was found after we agreed to pay the $40. Drinks were at minimum $17 dollars a piece. We were given 1 small bar of soap for a room of 4 people. I have had better amenities at a Marriott. Walls were very thin - we could hear the person puking in the bathroom next door. Don‚Äôt think I need to go back.
20,Everything over rated and over priced! Over priced simple bacon and eggs to a bottle of water. No fridge in the rooms. Housekeeping missing in Action. Can't get anyone on the phone watered down drinks in the casinos. I won't be back to Ceasars.
30,We stayed for the Independence Day holiday weekend and the hotel they provided us was not worth the money we spent. I know it was the holiday weekend so the prices were high but the room was not in good shape. The only area that looked clean or neat was the bathroom itself. The head frame of the bed was slightly scraped or scratched and there were some stains on a chair. The TVs were outdated and had no smart TV function. I tried plugging in the HDMI cable to my laptop to stream some Netflix. However the HDMI didn't even work. I had to watch the content via my laptop instead of the TV.    The room only allow access to basic internet at free of cost for first 2 devices connected within 24hrs. You'll need to pay $14.99 per additional device(s) and $14.99 for internet service after 24hrs. My phone service barely had any signal in the hotel room. The drinking water was not free and will charge you around $9.99 per bottle. Self Parking lot was a long walk if your room is either in Augustus Tower or Octvaius Tower. The buffet was packed and already all booked for the next two months. On the bright side hotel is located on the strip the bathroom was clean the bathroom had its own jacuzzi and the bed was not spring mattress.
50,Delano was a fantastic ambassador upon our arrival and I appreciate how well he took care of our needs! Our stay was brief but very relaxing. Our room was great but starting to show some wear. Overall a great experience.
20,"Was there planning a bachelor party and all I asked for was to be able to email guest services a email with an attachment to print off and their response...""ohhh I'm sorry we don't do that at this hotel...maybe you should find a FEDEX...opps their closed on the weekends. Good luck"". Alonf with other customer service no nos....I don't recommend amd will never recommend this hotel with the worst customer service. My money will be spent elsewhere and there are plenty of higher class options and please don't get me started on the housekeeping and turn down service....a joke...."
10,The room was for wheelchair thats ok but it got flooded on every shower.... get extra towels wasnt fast and when we came to the front desk to ask for a room change it was possible and the attitude of Krystel the manager was more than rude and careless.
50,This was our favorite resorts of all the ones we visited in Vegas. It felt more elegant less crowded and not quite as smoky as the others. The pools were amazing and comfortable great restaurants and shopping. Beautiful scenery cozy and quiet rooms. I have no complaints whatsoever. Check in and checkout were very easy and quick. Things were expensive in the hotel but we realized that was everywhere on the strip.
50,Everything at your fingertips This casino has it all arm from great food great gaming great service great beds very attentive maintenance staff. I only suggest a brief map of the resort so it‚Äôs easier for people to get around
20,The room was decent but room service doesn‚Äôt work nor sync with Ivy their AI Concierge and everything just points back to the main page of the website. You‚Äôd think that in 2021 a popular ‚Äúhigh class‚Äù hotel could set up their tech. Stay elsewhere.
20,I have not been to Caesar's in several years. I was terribly disappointed in the hotel. Our room was dirty. The carpet was ripped mirrors were smudged and there was even a leftover cup in the floor by the bed. Check-in took forever and calling housekeeping for extra towels was an exercise in patience. I would not recommend anyone stay here.
10,Ceasars lives by the rule all take and no give. They over charge you for everything while disregarding there responsibility to deliver the value for the dollar. Restaurants over priced no fridge in the rooms just mini bars over priced can't get anyone on the phone personal conserige. That's sends you links that hardly ever work water down free drinks. No one argues about spending there dollar while on vacation when you get what you pay for. Ceasars is a old resort with big money ideas that don't deliver. Heed my warning and go elsewhere. Or you will be sorry.
50,Beautiful luxurious room. Easy check in at the kiosk checkout was even easier as we did it online and you keep the room key to use for the free parking check out. Loved the concierge which I used via text. Right in the heart of the strip! Vegas strip prices but yolo we‚Äôll be back.
10,In April I contacted my host Anna to let her know that I will be coming to Vegas in June and wanted to speak to her about my offers. I was quite surprised when she first commented how I contacted her on her day off. Seriously?  For years I have stayed at Caesars in April and August but due to COVID those plans obviously changed. Last April my trip was planned (5 nights in Augustus Tower) but since the world was shut down the trip was cancelled. Fast forward to this April and since vaccines were in progress I decided to come in June. When I told Anna that she said that due to my play I do not qualify for Augustus Tower and there were not many offers for me. Was I being punished for a pandemic? My play was good enough for last April but suddenly it is not. As a Diamond player I didn't understand what was going on doesn't Caesars want returning players; obviously not. A few weeks later I emailed her again to try to see if any more offers opened up but she rudely NEVER responded. I then called another hotel and was treated very nicely and booked a room there.  I have been to the buffet numerous times and thought it was the best. Well no more. After waiting in line behind Seven Stars members for quite a while I finally was seated. To my surprise the food choices were not up to its usual standard and did not understand where the renovations were; it looked exactly as it has in the past. $78 for less food choices is not acceptable.  The treatment I received has made it extremely clear that Caesars Palace doesn't care about loyalty and you have lost this Diamond player forever.
20,Was looking forward to a great trip but when we got to the nonsmoking room and it smelled like someone just finished smoking weed 5 minutes before so we asked for a room changed we were able to change room but our new room was never made up the whole trip had to call down for towels 3 times!! There‚Äôs no concierge desk you have to text an automated system takes forever! Half the pools are just dedicated to cabanas so them pools are empty while the regular pools are full with people!I‚Äôll never stay there again way better options on the strip!
30,We stayed 4 nights at Caesars and housekeeping never came to our room once. We were out of the room plenty and would always push the ‚Äúmake up room‚Äù button but still nothing. Maybe you‚Äôre supposed to ask if you want service but that wasn‚Äôt something we were told upon check in so I‚Äôm not sure. We also noticed the garbage can by the elevator overflowing and garbage sitting on the floor next to it for over 24 hours. The air conditioner in our room was a little temperamental too it could be down to 63 and sometimes we‚Äôd still be way too warm and sometimes it was nice and cold. A couple times it reset on its own to 72 degrees.  The room overall was clean we also had a great view of the pool. Front desk was very helpful upon check in. Pools were great although hit or miss with the servers coming around to ask if you wanted to order. Lots of restaurants but the lines for these and the coffee stands were almost always really long. That seems to just be the norm for Vegas right now though! If you come to Vegas anytime soon bring your patience with you...
10,This place is a dump.  1. Check in lines -long slow  2. Shower wouldn‚Äôt drain  3. Cabinet for mini-fridge was hanging off the hinges  4. Elevators=graffiti torn up broken tiles  5. No complimentary coffee (there is a Keurig but if you use the coffee provided it‚Äôs $20).  6. Wi-fi works about 1/2 time (and it‚Äôs $50 per day with the ‚Äúresort fee‚Äù    I felt nickel and dimed for everything.    I‚Äôd recommend spending a little less and going across the street to Flamingo or spending a little more and go next door to The Mirage.
10,"Our family of 4 stayed at the Caesar's Palace for 3 nights at the Augustus tower with a view to the Bellagio's fountains. Floor 26 (which is their equivalent to about 6th floor). You can see part of the show but the view is not that great.    The room itself is very dated. Carpet stains throughout and stains in the sofas and chairs. Lighting is very poor in the room and it's kept intentionally dark ( I guess so you don't notice the dirtiness of the room). Make sure lamps and light bulbs work! we had one broken.    The bathroom doesn't have a fan to evacuate the humidity and so you see stains and cracks in the ceiling from that. There is a separate room for the toilet however the light itself is so dark you can barely see and have to keep the door open to get lightning from the adjacent room in the bathroom.    The room was booked for a family of 4 yet they included only two shower towels. Asked for extra towels but there were removed the next time housekeeping came to ""clean"" the room. Keep in mind they only make the beds and change towels but there is no more cleaning going on. Carpet wasn't even vacuumed or simple things like putting cushions back on the sofas weren't done.    Also SCAM ALERT! if you don't intend to use the mini bar do not touch it! It is a huge scam! If you move things around which will happen if you have kids! you'll be charged phantom fees. We were surprised with charges of almost $100 supposedly for consuming mini bar items. After disputing them we ended up with a $75 fee that they called restocking fee or personal use fee. Please be aware! This is on top of extra fees like daily resort fees and extra money if you need to check in early.    Definitely do not recommend!"
30,"When we booked Caesars was the best price. The check in lines were very long and then we had to circle back once our room was ready to stand in line again. Please work on your check-in process the hotel was beautiful and everything else was great; check-in process was given only 1 star.(terrible). The rating for ""service"" below was only average due to the terrible check-in process. Thank you!"
10,"The Ceaser's Associate I dealt with on the phone was mean and dismissive while I was attempting to find out why I had a $169 mini bar charge even though my wife and kids never used it. She actually hung up on me a few minutes ago which is why I am writing this review.  Be aware if your children are normal children they will touch the in room refrigerator. THE HOTEL WILL NOW CHARGE ME $169 ADDITIONAL FOR MY KIDS MOVING THINGS IN THE FRIDGE. I called to kindly let the hotel know they had made an error and that we did not partake of the $11 Reeses or the $12 water bottle as we had our own snacks and water. The billing agent then proceeded to tell me I need to be in control of my kids in the hotel room!!!! I suppose she has never had a child..... Then she told me they would reverse the charges but would then charge me $75 to ""RESTOCK"". I told her that was equally outrageous and she then HUNG UP ON ME.    If they can't see that we did not use the $30 can of beer with their own eyes then we just need to call this what it is... a TRAP set up by a multi billion company to treat their customers like TRASH by gouging them for no reason. They should have a special key that you must agree to use in order to access the mini fridge in your room that is sitting in plain sight  down near the floor where small children like to play that looks like every other mini fridge in every other hotel room.    As soon as I can I will call back to speak with someone else who will value me as an individual and will treat me with dignity and respect.    As a side note to the Ceaser's assoc who views this. It was my intention of returning to your hotel before this phone call while bringing business associates for meetings. However now that is unlikely."
20,Spent 4 days at this iconic resort and was really looking forward to staying for the first time. I've walked through several times for shopping and club experiences. The app they offer was very helpful for express check-in plus the kiosk. I got a room in the Julius Tower the room was huge it appeared to be very clean. Bed was really comfortable but that is all I could say that is positive in regards to this resort.  Not once during my 4 days did housekeeping clean the room. Housekeeping did knock on my door as I was getting ready to vacate the room asking how much longer before I left. I informed house keeping no one had cleaned the room in 4 days. Did not offer an apology stating that management currently is only emphasizing cleaning rooms as they are being vacated.  Food court was ridiculous. You will pay $50 for a run-of-the-mill pizza. I paid $44 for 2 Bobby flay burgers and fries. Their breakfast cr√™pe restaurant service is okay the sandwiches are over priced at $15 for croissant and cold in the middle. The resort fees $52/night - didn't see one single value in it.  Read lots reviews on how amazing the swimming pools are was not impressed. There is absolutely 0 shade available if you want a day bed that has a canopy it will cost to $550 plus additional service fees. A 24 pack of beer is $210. Well drinks are $30. Little wait staff who are running nonstop. I had to go to their snack bar long wait line that only had 2 attendants. The Cosmopolitan the Aria and MGM have much nicer pools with shade options.  If you are looking for customer service Caesars Palace is certainly not the place - unless you're ultra rich. Heck Las Vegas has forgotten what customer service is for the common tourist and still expects lots of tips. Uber drivers are long hauling you seems to be a shortage of Taxi's prices are inflated - seems Vegas is trying to financially catch up from last year.  Will not stay again sadly they likely won't care about any reviews.
20,The room I stayed in was horrible and was not properly stocked with linens. The room was not cleaned daily even though I asked for it. The best part was the casino and hotel. I will not be staying here again.
20,We stayed here this last week to celebrate our brand new engagement. First of all the view was impeccable arguably the best on the Strip but that was the only positive of our stay.    It started off poor with our parking and check-in experience. We walked our luggage from the garage to check in about 1:15 and the express kiosk told us that we could come back at 4:00 for our room. We asked to check our bags but were told we'd have to wait in another line so we walked our bags back to our car. At 4:15 we got the email that our room was ready at which point we waited over an hour for the express kiosks (what was the point of checking in before?). The service was horrible and would watch people cut our line then tell us they couldn't do anything.    The next day we spent at the Garden of the Gods pool where we booked a Canopy Daybed at the Neptune pool which we were told would be private for the guests who reserved it. For the first half of the day it was. Then the pool filled with unruly kids and guests because 2 of your life guards were ASLEEP! I mentioned something to our cabana host and was told there was nothing they could do. We left a couple hours early because the atmosphere just dropped off.    We spoke with a front desk clerk about all this and she was friendly and the manager came out which we appreciated. But he then seemed put off having to deal with us and gave us a $35 meal voucher which seemed like a way to get rid of us.    Horrible service and experience
10,We had stayed at Caesars for years and always had a great experience. This time was disappointing. We arrived on a Sunday around check in time and had to wait over an hour to check in. Can't fault them for that as we should've timed our arrival better. However for whatever reason the entire resort was packed while other hotels/casinos weren't nearly as crowded. Twice we were turned away from valet in the front and had to park in the Colosseum lot. The room was fine but trying to eat at any of their restaurants was a struggle. You needed reservations everywhere except for the food court.    Fast forward to check out time on Tuesday. Went to the front desk as I wanted to apply rewards credits against the balance. The agent typed in our rewards numbers and told me we had no credits. I had come in with existing credits through their credit card so I know that was not true. She told me to go to the rewards center to check. Walked over to find out they were not open yet. Went back to the front desk but there wasn't anything else the agent could do. Came home and tried calling Casears and the rewards center to see if I could apply the credits still but I have yet to be able to get a hold of anyone in the rewards center. I'm done with the Caesars properties and will be taking my business to the MGM properties instead.
30,We visited Caesars at the end of June for a quick 3 night getaway. We have been staying at Caesars for the past 7 plus years. We always stay at this hotel due to the beautiful spacious rooms in Palace Towers. Our favorite thing at the hotel is the pools. We love the amount of beautiful pools that they have and have even brought our children for a trip to enjoy as well. We were very disappointed this trip with the new daybeds that have seem to taken over the pools. I don‚Äôt like the fact that if I‚Äôm not willing to pay for a daybed that I am limited to certain pools. Really bad call  to change this as I had conversation with multiple unhappy people at pools about this as well. It sadly disappoints me that we will unfortunately not be back due to this new daybed takeover at the pools.
50,Short stay so only needed towels & t.p. during 3 day trip - don't understand the complaints about housekeeping how dirty can a room get? I guess they have daily housekeeping at home saw plenty of housekeeping carts on our floor in Augustus Towers.    Enjoyed the pool American Cafe casino Alto Bar Forum mall - gods show was not working - would have liked to see that again cheesy but cute LV great location in center of strip to get us to Hunger Games exhibit in MGM Grand & Myst√®re in Treasure Island. Highly & happily recommend Ceasars Palace!
50,My children love this place. The staff is always kind and very attentive to our needs. The ‚ÄúLazy River‚Äù is always appealing and super fun. We will definitely make more trips out here and continue to enjoy the slot machines the pool and the food.
40,We are here at Caesars Palace now finishing up a four-day birthday trip for my 60th birthday. I have to say that based on previous reviews I was a little nervous but I can honestly tell you this has been a spectacular stay! The hotel looks phenomenal. Check in line was long but it went quickly. We had a beautiful room no issues whatsoever spotless clean. I am guessing that as time goes on they have they have hired more staff so that I saw people cleaning all the time lots of staff everywhere Dash noting no issues. Casino is very large and spaced out. One negative is if you‚Äôre a family on a budget even though the rooms are affordable not much else is. One more negative is when looking for breakfast in the morning even though there‚Äôs a nice food court with several restaurants none of them serve breakfast. So we had a walk across the street and down the block to find some decent breakfast. There are a little Coffee shops in the hotel are extremely pricey and very limited selections. Lunch and dinner is also quite pricey here at the hotel but within walking distance there‚Äôs lots of other choices mainly across the street. But I don‚Äôt want that to make it seem like we didn‚Äôt love our stay here because we did. We travel a lot and go to many different hotels and I would say this is the nicest pool area we have ever seen! Plenty of space plenty of chairs plenty of pools! We did rent a cabana for one of the days and it was very expensive for us but it was so worth it we felt like royalty. Today we don‚Äôt have a cabana but there‚Äôs plenty of chairs all over and the vibe at the pool it‚Äôs just nice. Also by the pool there‚Äôs not tons of kids running around screaming which we often find out other hotels. But that doesn‚Äôt mean if you have kids they won‚Äôt love the pool area because there‚Äôs seven different pools to choose from and each one is as beautiful as the other. The kids that are here seem to be having a really good time. Finally the location is also fantastic. Right in the center of the strip surrounded by numerous other hotels that are magnificent and fun. The attached picture is of one of the pools.
50,Tangela from Caesars Palace Is The Best She has the best Customer Services and she most definitely deserves Employee of the Month.. Thanks Again Tangela and yes I enjoy staying here at the Palace Quaay
10,I have been to Vegas several times and had always wanted to stay at Caesars. The staff was unfriendly and rude at times. We were told that we shouldn't have brought kids to Vegas when we questioned the pool closing at 6:00. The last night there we ended up checking out at 4:30 in the morning due to a huge party going on in the room next to us. We had an early flight and had called three times asking for security to come up and ask the neighboring room to quiet down.
10,Whenever Vegas is mentioned Caesars Palace is on top of the recommendations. After staying 8 days in the hotel/casino I have to commit honestly that the palace is not recommendable for a stay.  The food offered and drinks available in the hotel are way too expensive - even for the strip. If you pay more than 12 $ for a small beer that is too much. Asking for 4.19 for a double shot espresso - without tip- I would say there is something wrong.  Using the cooler for personal use is fined with 75 $. I did not even open the cooler (it was blocked). On the bill - afterwards a Margarita is charged.... ridiculous.  In 8 days no room service was done although the ladies and gentlemen were cleaning all the rooms around. Using the virtual concierge did not lead to nowhere - so after 8 days of stay the room was looking awful.  (In 5* hotels I have stayed in Europe and the States the room service was done at least 1/day usually 2/day)....    At the garden of gods - a nice place 2 be but plastic boxes were everywhere (around the main pool) the smaller pools were reserved only for renters of daybeds and cabanas (rent 200 $each).    The Caesar Reward club is available only for US residents - for us foreigners we can queue up and wait at the desk. I can forward a picture of the queue in case it is interesting why I did not sign in - and of course noone mentioned the advantages given from Caesars...    Well - being honest compared to other resorts I have visited - the Caesars might be still better than other hotels but pricing for food and beverages and service is TERRIBLE.
20,It starts at the top and when the management is rude it trickles down to the staff. We arrived at 3:30pm and they wanted to charge me a $40 ‚Äúearly check-in‚Äù fee so we waited until 4 and then we were able to check in. You would think that 30 minutes wouldn‚Äôt kill them and obviously the rooms are ready by then.    Forget about parking here even when we checked in with luggage the front valet told us to park at the Cesar Mall and walk all the way towards the front desk. If you are not a 7 star guest you are treated like a third rate citizen. It‚Äôs HORRIBLE.    Then after we check in our toilet did not flush properly so I was on hold for 18 minutes until someone can come on the line and then took them another 85 minutes for them to fix our toilet.    SO you‚Äôd think with all that happening things would get better‚Ä¶. WRONG! Since we don‚Äôt want house keeping I called again only to be placed on hold for another 10 minutes and I asked for 6 towels since we are staying for 4 nights. The house keeping operator said ‚ÄúI am only authorized to give 3 towels‚Äù. WHHHATT!!!!?!! Here we are trying to save them from cleaning our room only for them to say only 3 towels at a time!>!>! That‚Äôs something even Howard Johnson doesn‚Äôt do.    The restaurants here are sub par and the Bachannal buffet is only available after 4pm and you have to wait in line for hours until you can eat.    EVERYTHING is overpriced. We had a continental breakfast at PRONTO by GIADA and two yogurts a muffin and a coffee turned out to be $43. I mean seriously?    Lastly you have to now park your car yourself all the way back in the self parking lot and parking is now $18 a day.    Thank you Cesars Vegas for charging me exorbitant rates crazy food prices (I don‚Äôt mind paying for food if its good but its not) the resort fee that doesn‚Äôt give me any ‚Äúresort‚Äù feeling rude staff and horrible service.    Taking my business elsewhere.
10,We have been staying 2-3 times a year at Caesars for 40 years-since our honeymoon in 1981 and we were so disappointed with this trip. As many have said it was filthy dirty in many areas and though we requested housekeeping service several times we were there 5 nights-and it never happened. The rooms in Augustus are getting very tired with peeling furniture and very worn carpets and most of the lightbulbs were dim at best. My husband is a Diamond Plus and they cut the perks of this status drastically. Simple things that didn‚Äôt cost money like a special line at Starbucks have been eliminated. They also eliminated the discount for Diamond level for spa services-which used to be substantial. Further they are charging as much or more for spa services as they did pre-COVID while only being able to have your service and leave-no use of the facilities. We were told it was Navada law but when I called Wynn they said they had been fully open for several weeks-because they had 88% employee vaccinations. We have already decided that this was our last stay until the hotel turns it around-if they ever do. When I went to the pool not only could you only access it from one door that was on the opposite side of the hotel from our room several of the pools were blocked off for use only by those who had rented the cabanas or other special pool furniture. This was a first and not a pleasant one-wow!  Shopping in the Forum Shoppes was unpleasant as well-most stores had their doors closed or blocked off and made you feel like you were not welcome to come in. Not surprisingly I saw very few shopping in many of these stores-it is very intimidating.    We would like to compliment most of the employees who still seem to care about the guests and were willing to try to help as much as possible when they could. A big shout out for Carl Melissa DJ Taylor and Heimi in Old Homestead-they are all amazing and it shows in how crowded their bar stays!
20,I wanted to bring my wife to Las Vegas for her birthday to make it special. Unfortunately we had a few things happen at caesers palace that just left a bad taste in my mouth.    1. The steak house old homestead was definitely not worth it. When you spend that much money on dinner it should be perfect. Save your money and go to outback    2. Our shower was not draining property and when I called the front desk I could not get ahold of anyone so I had to go to the front desk stand in line to talk to a front desk agent and still no one ever came to fix the shower    3. We were treated rudley by the pool staff because apparently we were in a pool you need to rent a cabana to be in. I guess that the $40 a day resort fee isn't good enough to use the pool.    This is probably our last trip to Vegas as we get better service at our local indian casino sycuan in San Diego.  When you pay high prices and resort fees I expect better service than this
20,My wife and I stayed at Ceasars Palace from June 16th to the 21st. Better experience than last time but still not acceptable... we are Diamond Club members and have been going to Ceasars for the past 11 years and we were shocked to see how bad the Casino still is. The slot machines are still very dirty with spilled drinks and cigarette ashes all over them. Clearly they are not cleaning them regularly as they say they are. Pool area was still filthy with trash and empty cups floating in the pool and all over the pool area. Trashcans overflowing with garbage all day.. interior and exterior falling apart and the grounds in front just filthy with trash and stains in the concrete. Our room in the Julius tower was clean but a bit outdated. My advice: Do Not go to Ceasars Palace. If your a Ceasars Rewards member I would recommend The Paris instead. Ceasars has gone downhill and their Mgmt just doesnt care anymore. So sad because that used to be the best casino in Vegas.
10,Been on hold with housekeeping for 21 minutes after asking five times today to get rooms cleaned. We also need clean towels and toilet paper but we keep getting ‚ÄúAbsolutely! A housekeeper will deliver the requested items. Please ensure you remove your Room Occupied sign so a housekeeper can assist you.‚Äù No one showed - now that I have been on hold for 21 minutes I got disconnected! I don‚Äôt mind paying the ridiculous price they charge for things if I am receiving the service I was promised. I picked Caesars because I thought it was the best - I was so wrong!
10,Pool closes at 6. Restaurants booked weeks out. $50 resort fee for WiFi. You can't go out for the day come back and enjoy the hotel's amenities. Place is a total disappointment. Save your money and book a regular hotel like Comfort Inn. At this point I'm paying resort prices for Comfort Inn amenities except at Comfort Inn they don't charge you $75 to use the refrigerator.
50,Do yourself a favor and tip the front desk staff when you check in. Amazing what a $20 between the your credit card and license will do.    Very clean facility has been kept up to date. That said you pay for what you get. While  Rooms are competitively priced everything else is pricy. $28 for a strawberry daiquiri on pool deck would be an example. Restaurants are first rate but again very pricy.    This is probably the only hotel I would stay at in Vegas.
50,This is just my first time coming to Las Vegas staying at Caesars Palace. My first great experience was checking in with Delano. This trip has already started off with a bang. Thank you so much for starting my great experience off well Delano!
40,First time in LV and at Caesar‚Äôs Palace. The overall of the hotel was ok.  Our big disappointment came when we innocently went to book the day excursion to Grand Canyon  operated by Grey Line from one of the ladies staff at the Bell Counter. Not realizing that we would be sent off to pay directly to the driver at the sky-rocketed price (the highest of their tariff. If you buy it on line it costs only $100 pp. but we had to pay $266 pp to the driver what a big difference!) The driver named Thomas who was at the end rather rude and the bell lady named Tina were simply DISHONEST!
30,We planned our trip online in Jan 2021 for travel in June. Our reservations were for King Bed in the Augustus Tower. Upon our late night arrival a king size bed was not available and we were pushed to a double queen. The room was used and abused with clogged drain and broker towel rack. The glass shower made a loud crack upon opening. We were afraid the glass would shatter. Every time we wanted to change rooms the front desk had a 1/2 wait. We finally reached a great front desk personal named Daniel N. He was able to move us to an acceptable room. Made the rest of our stay memorable. Thanks
20,"Vegas may be ""open"" but if Caesar's Palace is any indication they aren't ""back"". Long lines and waits at restaurants. If you want to buy a soda or bottle of water--forget about it. Almost impossible to find anything open. Many of the usual places are closed and management can't be courteous enough to post a sign that ""our other location is open...blah blah blah"". I get that workers are hard to find so replace them with Vending Machines. A guest shouldn't have to walk for miles in hopes of finding a place to buy a bottle of water. Also check-in is a mess."
30,I recently stayed at caesars because in my mind it was ‚Äòthe nicest hotel in vegas.‚Äô My last experience was so terrible that I know longer believe this. My first room had no air conditioning and it was 114 degrees. I called down to have it fixed and the first guy couldn‚Äôt and the second guy assessed the problem by putting his finger in a vent and saying with certainty that the air blowing out was 61 degrees like his finger was a calibrated thermometer. After sweating in 82 degrees I go down to the front again to get a room with ac and I‚Äôm moved to a room with a cockroach on the floor. I go downstairs again and she offers to send housekeeping up. I said no. I get a new room and it finally has ac and no roaches except this one has spoiled shrimp in the mini fridge. I had such a terrible experience at caesars that I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be back and that‚Äôs a shame because I‚Äôve gone multiple times over multiple decades.
20,Upon arrival my booked offer was denied. On said off the blackout dates were not shown. Was given a alternative offer by guest services but said offer was not actually applied. After being reduced free play was still not applied to my account. Resort credit was also reduced. Place was seriously lacking staff with long waits to speak with unaccommodating hosts and miss information given by hosts who were to busy to even use their resources to look into my offers or try to correct the many issues presented to them.
20,When we arrived our air conditioner wasn't working properly so I called to get assistance but was on hold for over an hour. Then it took another hour to get the air repaired. The line to check in was so long we stood there for approximately 30 minutes. There were extra charges on our bill that were not ours so we had to wait in line again to check out. Also room was not vacuumed. There were paper and straws under a chair. When asked to get a different room we were told there were no rooms available and they did not offer to send housecleaning.
50,"Our trip to Vegas was really so my wife and I could get married... again. While there she had a few things to check off her bucket list: stay at Caesar's win on #22 on a roulette table get married by Elvis. And we accomplished all 3.  Check-in was a little difficult. We wrote that off to David being at the end of his shift and after having a difficult day. But overall not a good first impression. Our room was on the 4th floor which meant a quick elevator ride to and from the casino dinner etc. The room as exceptional with a big bathroom and lots of room for the 2 of us to move around.  Dinner at Old Homestead Steakhouse at Caesar's was the best dinner I've had in 60 years. Shrimp cocktail? LOLOL. Each ""shrimp"" is the size of your arm. Kimberly was our waitress and she has been there for 36 years. Either she is exceptional or they just won't let her apply for any other position. Maybe both. But if you don't ask for Kimberly you are not getting the best service available. A little expensive? Yes. But my Lord ! If you are like us and have a budget that allows for one over-the-top dinner every year THIS IS IT! If you see her please let her know the couple that has known one another for 16000+ days says hi. :-)  We also spent a good deal of time at the different pools. Valentino? Valencia? I can't remember her exact name but the woman never stopped smiling. She has to absolutely love her job. Knew the menu timely always moving and smiling. KJ at the pool was a truly top-notch representative of the property. He mentioned Caesar's is the only employer he had ever had and he was 40. Open honest down to Earth great with directions around the casino and each pool. He's the person EVERYONE wants to hire but there is no was Caesar's would let him go. Be sure to check in with him if you need a cabana close to the swim-up black jack table.  As we were walking out the door at Caesar's to head to the airport we had one final $25 chip and hadn't hit #22 all week. I got scared and instead of #22 I bet black. #22 !!!! Told everyone at the table the story: my wife's bd is 22 we were married on 22 3 grandchildren born on 22. And Angel the lady running the roulette table said ""Want me to do it again for you?"" So with $50 on #22 I'll be damned if #22 didn't come up again! Miss Angel was definitely our angel.  Loved it so much we agreed to return every year until one of us passes away and then the other will spread ashes on the grounds."
30,Caesar's Palace was happy to welcome me back and their normal premium rates but it was very frustrating that their level of service was not close to what I paid for. The room was clean the mini-bar well stocked but when I needed to call down to the bell desk I was put on a very long hold to even reach an operator then once I was finally able to request my bags the bell hop took fifty minutes while my friend and I wasted time waiting in the room. He was apologetic and said that his supervisor had pulled some of the staff away for a meeting right at checkin noting the unacceptable wait. He indicated that this type of poor service was norm right now since Ceasar's hadn't increased the amount of staff working from the now that the pandemic effect is declining and folks like me are wanting to return to Vegas. I'm going to wait to rebook at Ceasar's properties in hopes they'll get their act together.
50,Ceasar‚Äôs Palace defiantly brings out the feeling of a palaceand was conveniently placed so that customers could access all activities.The hotel room my family and I stayed in had a wonderful view of the pool and had many luxurious features which added to the nice comfort of the room.Everything was nicely cleaned and orderly and best of all the staff was very helpful through our entire stay.Would recommend for anyone looking for a hotel in the Las Vegas Strip.    -The Guzm√°n Family
40,Requested strip view or pool view room. My BFFS 60th bday & her first time to Vegas. We got a room with a view of the dirty ac units with no view zero view of Vegas. Sad since there are so many rooms & I booked very early!
10,Place has become a disaster. This is the worst place on the strip. Rooms have stained chairs dirty floors. Had to wait an hour on hold to get through to the bell desk and retrieve luggage. Staff is rude and unaccommodating when asking directions. Will never stay here again.
30,The star rating was strictly on the fact that as a vegan and the in room dining options they have I ended buying food instead of being able to enjoy w everyone else! Stayed in the Palace tower suite on the 28th floor. Butler services are amazing.
20,The place was dirty. The buttons of the slot machines was full cigarette ashes soft drink stains and sticky. The push door button for the handicap to the garage was broken. I was in a non-smoking room and the carpet had cigarette burn mark. I am very disappointed.
40,Caesar‚Äôs is in a great location on the strip. The check in was very slow and if you check in before 4 be ready to pay 50 extra dollars. The casino wasn‚Äôt my favorite. There were just a few blackjack tables with minimum bet of 25 50 and 100. I went to another casino and played with the minimum of $10 bet. The shower was moldy and the paint chips were falling into the shower. If you stay bring your own bottle water and snacks it will save you a lot of money.
20,We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and did not receive room service at all. Called everyday to complain and got amenities sent to the room (towels etc). And they told me they were short staffed. If you were short please tell people ahead of time. Covid is still active and not cleaning rooms does not appear to align with CDC guidelines.  In addition you cannot even use the fridge because they stock it up with their own overpriced items. You will have to pay 75$ if you want to use the fridge. I won‚Äôt stay here again.
10,Where to begin... this is the most dilapidated and gross hotel I have ever stayed in. After checking in we headed to our suite in the Julius tower. The smell of this room was unbearable. Imagine smoke mixed with sweat mixed with mold. That is the best description I can come up with. The room itself was dark and dingy with only fluorescent lamps scattered about that did not work with the light switches. For what should have been a non-smoking room there were several cigarette burns on the furniture. We of course went down and waited in the registration line (again) to complain. Since the hotel was at capacity they said there was nothing they can do except to try to deodorize it and give us a $100 food and beverage credit. We were stuck as every hotel seemed to be at capacity. After a disappointing dinner at Bacchanal we made our way back to the room. With their deodorizing treatment the smell was still there but more bearable but come morning the smell was back at full strength. It just gets worse from here.    Everything in this place is beat up. From caved in tiles and broken glass frames held together with duct tape in the elevators to ripped wallpaper and scuff marks galore along the hallways. A quarter of the slot machines were out of order and their selection of games is terrible. Their AC could not keep up with the volume of people on the casino floor and their ventilation system is far from adequate. We chose to wear masks both inside and outside our hotel room just to provide a layer of protection from the smells and smoke. With so many people on the property you get no reception which forces you to use their property Wi-Fi but they limit you to 2 devices per room as part of their resort fee. For every additional device they charge you $15 a day so my husband and I just connected our phones and not our laptop or tablet. I have never experienced anything like this and we will never return. Thank God this was just for 1 night. It is a shame because they have some excellent employees who give great service. Our bell man and check in receptionist were incredibly nice and helpful. I wish they had a better place to work as this place is falling apart.
10,I have stayed at Caesars before but this was such a letdown!  Our group had two cabanas at the pool One cabana was flooded and unusable. Around 1 pm the pool opened at 11 am they stocked our fridges with a case of warm water. Only saw waitstaff once I asked if I could get a drink she looked directly at me and kept walking. When my nephew approached the guy trying to clean the unusable cabana he said he was too busy trying to dry out the cabana. We never did get into the second cabana but since we used the outside chairs there was nothing they could do.  That evening we had a reservation at the buffet for 10 people for 5:30 for 10 people. We all arrived before 5:15 paid for the buffet then stood in line for 45 minutes. I was under the impression that Caesars had the best buffet in Vegas there were lots of choices everything was very clean all o0f the dishes were were filled before they were empty but most of the food was very bland and overcooked. Desserts were the only thing worth having.  I goot up the nexrt morning to make coffee but could not find the kuerig cups so
30,The wait to check in was terrible. The line was out the door! My bathroom had someone else‚Äôs hair in the shower other than that it was ok. It seemed like they were short staffed. My daughter key stopped working for her room and she had to wait in the hall for an hour for security to show up. I saw one fist fight in the lobby and it took security forever to show up but it‚Äôs Vegas lol.
50,Everything about this property is absolutely spectacular. The rooms are lovely with such comfortable beds. Whether its the pool scene casino shopping or dining the Caesars is unmatched in my opinion. You really do get what you pay for and I can honestly say this is the number one place to stay while in Vegas. It‚Äôs iconic... the king of The Strip! Would stay again 1000 times more. üòä
10,On the morning of the day of checkin at Ceasars for my business conference I did the checkin process online to avoid the lines at the hotel based on Caesars push notification email. However when I arrived their system had lost my entire record of my early checkin which they charged me for and after having to wait in a long line anyway they told me my room that I had already reserved and paid for early checkin was not available!    In addition when I checked in they forgot to give me a valet ticket for my vehicle and then after the checkin it took an hour and a half to deliver my bags to my room once I got my room.    All of their system/process/personnel incompetence put me about four hours behind schedule. I arrived at the valet at 11:30 and was finally in my room with my bags at 4pm. Missed a lunch gathering with other members of my organization and an opportunity to meet some key people of the conference.    Many other issues with room service and their $15 small bottles of water in the room because there is no room service for ice or water. In addition to poor planning for the conference food service. They knew we had hundreds of people yet every meal ran short of multiple choices.    Bottom line what a horrible experience at Caesars and I will reccomend to our conference to never hold our yearly event at Caesers again and my family will certainly never stay here again.    Not sure what happened to Caesers but it is NOT a place worth spending good money at any longer.
20,Terrible customer service.. arrived early due to flights which I did not expect room to be ready but they checked us in and told me they would call when room was ready after 6 hours never called had to wait in huge check in line again to get rooms.. no coffee or condiments.. cannot use fridge in room.
20,One red flag is noticing management only comments (generic ones at that) on positive 5 star reviews. Looking at this forum it‚Äôs apparent there are many unsatisfied guests than satisfied. I hope management takes these reviews seriously and follows up. If I has these issues resolved while on the property I would only be writing a positive review. For it being my first time at Caesars Las Vegas it would not be my first choice again. While my room and facilities were nice I was disappointed with everything else. Caesars in general was hot and stuffy. My room was stuffy and hot also. There was mold all Over the bathroom vent. That can‚Äôt be good for health reasons. My shower was clogged. Please make sure your cleaning team cleans those. My check in experience was terrible. Certain discounts not honored while being a Platinum rewards member. Each time I needed to go to the front desk for something I was in line for atleast 30-45 min. Then when I requested a room change for broken AC which would not stay a constant temp was instructed to go to front desk. Could not be managed over phone. If I wanted to call Caesars Rewards I was on hold for atleast 45 min. With no live person. The system was not efficient and I was not impressed. There was also only 4 check in people and a line full of people. Not sure where the process is broken but it needs to be fixed ASAP. It was so painful to watch that it made me want to jump in and help out (coming from someone in the customer service industry). There should be no excuses for this system at one of the top notch hotels in Vegas.
10,Absolutely huge mistake booking our trip here for so many reasons. Had issues with our room including noisy AC unit and if you stay here I hope you are in good shape...thankfully I am because there is tons of walking.    They missed a day of housekeeping and do not even TOUCH anything in the mini bar because once you pick it up they charge you. I didn't want the cheapest hotel and CP was more of the pricy ones so I thought it would be good. It wasn't. Very difficult trying to get ahold of front desk too. For stuck on hold 2x and just gave up.    And I just assumed that the prices of all the food places in the lobby was in line with Vegas but I was shocked when I went to other hotels and the prices were way more affordable for their food joints    Numerous other issues. Tried to work with management for a partial refund but no one seemed to care.    Really sucked because I don't get to travel that often and my poor choice of hotel ruined my vacation ...in fact we cut our losses and checked out a day early and went home
10,I expected more! Our check in took 2 hours on a Sunday! We couldn‚Äôt get our baggage for 3 hours after check in cause they were behind. Our phone in room was not working and the shower was clogged and gross.
30,It pains me to write a less than stellar review of a place my wife and I have loved and visited many times but if I'm being honest Caesars doesn't provide the same level of quality as it once did. On our recent trip we experienced a bad odor in our room (two years ago it was in the hallway leading to the pool) poor customer service (no one would answer the phone) our room was only cleaned once during our four night stay but I did have a cleaning staff person barge into my room after mid-night supposedly to provide service. That's never happed to me before and I can't imagine it's standard practice! The fountains at the pool weren't working during one day of our stay which makes for an ordinary day in the sun as opposed to the pool being a highlight of the property. And unfortunately for my wife and I we don't enjoy the smell of marijuana which is not only very common around the property but totally invaded our room one night from a party down the hall. By contrast our experience at the two properties next door owned by a rival company were very enjoyable. I'll stay at one of those on my next trip should we decide to return. I'm not naive about anything Las Vegas - been visiting for 25 years and do know that times have changed. However the standard for excellent accommodations and service hasn't changed and Caesars missed the mark this time around. Perhaps it's just the pains of the hotel getting back in the groove after the pandemic - I hope that others have a more pleasant experience.
20,Caesars is giving away the farm. With free rooms and free play. To put it lightly Caesers is attracting much lower end guests. To see if my assumption was correct I went over to the Palazzo and it was a night and day difference. It was much more sophisticated crowd. I go to vegas about 3 times a year I don't think im be staying at Caesars any more
50,This was our first stay at Caesar‚Äôs and it definitely didn‚Äôt disappoint! We stayed in the Octavious Tower and our room was lush with an amazing view of the pools. All of the staff were very kind and extremely accommodating. Lounging by the pool daily was so relaxing. The only complaint I will make is that The Excalibur provides you free water when your poolside here we had to pay $40 for a bucket of 5 bottles of water. üò≥ And no they won‚Äôt allow you to bring water in with you. To be a hotel that charges as much as they do for their rooms you‚Äôd think they could give some free water or at least allow you to bring some in to the pool area rather than charging you $40 for 5 (11.16 oz) bottles. I guess they figure if they make it to where you have no other choice you‚Äôll pay it and of course we did. You have to have water when it‚Äôs > 100 degrees outside. But other than the extra extravagant expenses it was a fabulous experience and an absolutely gorgeous place to stay!
40,"The property was just awe inspiring and very beautiful. Just amazing to walk around and see the designs and architecture. And the rooms were very clean. And actual free parking was nice. The part we did not like to much was that the WiFi service was painfully slow unless we got right up to the window. And the price of most of the food choices was nuts! Especially the sit down locations. Would also have been nice to have a fridge in the room that the guests could use. Also I do not like how the per night price are advertised. They say the room is say $150 a night but then you look further and they add $50/night for ""property fee"". Why night just make the price what it is...Read the fine print. Also note the checking times. It was 4pm for us so they offered an upgrade for $50 a night. So dumb that means they had rooms ready. Why not just get us in a room? And we were lucky when we checked in the checkin line was very short. As we walked around later the line was like a 1.5 hour wait! So be prepared... And as far as the pool goes? The flooring is sooo HOT in the summer. No umbrellas and the pool water is very cold in some pools."
10,worst management. I booked a room with king-size bed but they gave a queen bedded room. When asked without any regrets they simply said that the booked room is not guaranteed. Luxury hotel with very cheap behavior.
10,We called in to book and they messed up the reservations. Noticed something was wrong so called back to confirm and get corrected. Nope showed up and still wrong. Finally after over an hour waiting to check in we get a room key to a temporary room no 2 queens rooms now. So we are forced to move rooms tomorrow. They know we needed the pull out in the king room for kids but oh yeah they didn‚Äôt tell us you have to requests sheets. Now 1:00 am with over 2 hours trying to get things settled and we can‚Äôt go to bed. So much for a luxury hotel.
10,Don't stay here! I've stayed a couple times before and loved it but did NOT have a good experience. Staff were lovely but the hotel was terrible and clearly did not care AT ALL about their guests from the crazy long line to check in with only a couple go staff to a $75 fee if you wanted to put any personal items in your mini-fridge. There is NO CONCIERGE service just a terrible 'virtual assistant' who tries to sell you stuff. The staff were mostly unable to help and extra charges abounded. It is post-COVID so there is a bit of a labor shortage but that was not the problem here. I did NOT feel like they cared if we ever came back again- so I won't.
10,Stayed with comps 4 nights they placed a $604 credit hold on my card without telling me then kept adding additional Charges to my card on file. Takes about 10 days they say to remove holds!  Housekeeping never serviced our room even though we requested when we checked in and daily. Still never came and I had to grab towels from carts in hall and pile our dirty towels in hall.  Asked to stay close to main entrance because my son was in wheelchair and my elderly mother with me. Got placed in Octavius Tower which was very long walk and farthest away. Doors to pool were closed from that tower so had to walk even further to the only doors they had open for pool.  Lots of drunks in Garden of Gods pool. Even glass bottles in pool area. But they had us throw out our bottles of water before we could enter.  Machines did not pay out most places in food court were closed and very long longs for what was open. Paid $100 for 4 burger meals at their fast food place in food court!  It was not a good experience and we won‚Äôt stay there again. Too many other options with better service more amenities and not so big that you wander and walk miles to get anywhere.
50,We stayed in Caesars Palace as a halfway stop to our family vacation in California. We had a long day in the car with our toddler and were definitely worn out when we arrived. Emma at the front desk was amazing. She kept our kid happy while checking us in and was very kind and patient. The room was beautiful and we would definitely stay again! We loved the view of the strip at night.
50,My wife and visited here for a week to celebrate our anniversary. Neither of us had ever been to Vegas so we weren‚Äôt quite sure what to expect. Check-in was a bit chaotic but we used the self-service kiosk which took about 5 minutes. Our room was available immediately and we received directions to our room and elevator. We found the room very spacious and clean with a great view of the Bellagio fountains. We did not utilize the mini-bar as the prices were outrageous. The room was quiet and we were never woken up by other guests. We utilized housekeeping twice during our stay and had no issues either time. The hotel is huge and is very easy to get lost in. We visited the casino a few times and had breakfast at Pronto one morning as well as dinner at Joes (reviewed independently). Overall we had a great experience and have plans to visit again.
10,Ok so I have always stayed at the MGM strangely and randomly received $75 free play for ceasars palace by mail 2 days prior to planned trip so decided to visit the Caesars Palace to check it out. Brought 5 of my family members. Waited 1hr in line at players club to get card and redeem the free play. I made about $20 off free play I played $100 after $100 and I kid you not I didn‚Äôt win not even 10 cents from machines it was soooo strange how on earth does this even happen? I felt like I was in the twilight zone. Hundreds of their machines were out of service. It was crazy I‚Äôve never seen this on the strip anywhere. Sat at one machine stuck $40 in and realized that screen wasn‚Äôt showing how much I had or how much I was betting. Tried to cash out and didn‚Äôt work I hit call light and just thought whatever I will play in the blind. When attendant did arrive she accused me of playing a machine that was clearly having issues. I nearly exploded because literally 100s of machines out of order. Both my sons experienced machine shut downs during play. My husband had video black Jack machine black out twice and then worked. What the hell is going on with this place? I‚Äôm soooooo confused.
40,Caesar's Palace in my opinion has the best location. It's in the middle of the Strip so you are close to all the main attractions. The ambiance is also pretty good it has great restaurants and the staff are all very professional.    The room is starting to show it's age but still has most of the stuff you would expect from a good hotel. The bed was good but the pillow was rather average. The cleaning is good but not great. I found some small yellow stains on one of the pillowcases and some of stains at the end of the fitted sheets. The bathroom also had some stains on the counter. So not great but nothing that will ruin your stay.    The hotel is massive though. You'd have to walk quite a distance through the gaming floors from the parking lot to the check in counter and then to the appropriate elevator for you room. Parking is free by the way although the key card didn't work on the gate so I had to call them to open it.    All the staff wore masks although I'd say about 80% of the guests didn't. Also did not find any hand sanitizer stations.    I can't complain too much about my stay here. I booked a bargain through Chase's Luxury Hotel program which gave me free early check in room upgrade free breakfast credit and a $100 food credit to be used in on-site restaurants. It was also cheaper to book through Chase than through the Caesar website. Those of you with Chase cards I highly recommend you to look into the Luxury Hotel program.
10,Terrible housekeeping and front desk service.  Housekeeping: We were given a dirty room and waited over 2 hours to have it cleaned. Also I requested daily housekeeping via phone call to housekeeping manager when I had called about the dirty room. We did not receive housekeeping even once during our 4 night stay and I had to call every day for towel exchange .  Front desk: They were unavailable to speak to most of our stay (I let phone ring over 20 times each attempt (prob 5 tries) and the lines were always too long to talk to them in person. I understand that it is very difficult to find and keep employees at this time. But since that is the case maybe ownership should take a little less profit this year and sell less rooms not short change loyal guests who have stayed at your properties 4-5 times throughout the masking/plexiglass time in Vegas.  Also since I had to check in at a kiosk because of stupidly long wait to speak to a real person I was not given the room I reserved (Octavius Tower) but instead was given the inferior Julius Tower room. Again no one to ask that they honor the original reservation. This will be our last time staying here.
10,One star too many‚Ä¶They advertise seven pools you can only use 4 of them‚Ä¶.Paid for a king suite with the view of the strip I got a concrete wall and the mirror in my bedroom to look like a window‚Ä¶No housekeeping for three days straight.. recessed lighting was hanging from the ceiling.. The safe jammed it took an hour for the person to come open up our safe‚Ä¶ call the general manager he never called back‚Ä¶maita (operations manager) told me I would not pay any hotel fees for the rest of my stay that was a lie I didn‚Äôt pay for to the other three I paid for‚Ä¶.. I stayed in motels with better service and nicer rooms I wish I was exaggerating but I‚Äôm not. I will be writing to the board of directors chances are they‚Äôre not gonna care either if That‚Äôs the kind of management they hire
10,The room we check into was total false advertisement I seen online. This room looks like a room from the Travelodge. the dresser is peeling and cut looks like a dog bit on it. The walls have stains and the carpet has stains I just feel like I couldn‚Äôt enjoy my stay because the room I booked looks nothing like I stayed in.. very disappointed that is my FIRST & LAST STAY at the caesars palace. Also the front desk asked me ‚Äúdo you want to pay extra for a nice room?‚Äù So you are meaning to tell me due to me rejecting that offer I got put in a ‚Äúnot nice room‚Äù once again i am beyond disappointed.    Honestly the motel 6 has better rooms than ceasars palace. Just a heads up
10,A group of 6 of us men friends and family recently stayed at Caesars Palace from May 19th through the 22nd. One of the members of our group had previously booked 3 rooms for the 3 nights using Caesars rewards points. Upon arrival we asked the front desk if any upgrades were available since we were only staying on weeknights and we assumed that the hotel would be at less than maximum capacity. After looking into the system the lady at the front desk said we could upgrade our standard rooms to suites if we were to reduce our room count from 3 standard rooms to 2 suites for a nominal fee.    After updating our reservations we were then presented with two statements that had boxes with the financials of the ‚ÄúDaily Room Rates.‚Äù These statements showed the rates broken down by night with the first two nights being comped and the third night showing a charge of a few hundred dollars which we assumed was the ‚Äúnominal fee.‚Äù The bottom of this box showed ‚ÄúTotals: 3 Nights $###.##. Given the values provided in the box we happily obliged to the lady‚Äôs instructions to sign here here and here.        The morning we were supposed to leave we began checking out at the Kiosks near the front desk and were surprised to find ~$5000 worth of charges on our bill(s). Before proceeding with the checkout we went to the front desk to ask what all of the charges were for. The original statements were then presented that had a note in full text outside of the Daily Room Rate box that contained all of the financials/dollar figures that said the rooms would be charged $500 per room per night for the upgrade. The misleading nature of this formatting was surprising to us because if the dates of our reservation were known we would have expected to see those balances shown in the box of ‚ÄúDaily Room Rates‚Äù with the financials showing in dollar figure form as opposed to a note in full text outside of said box. This was also surprising given the fact that the front desk had told us that our upgrades would come with nominal fees which were in line with the Daily Room Rate totals presented to us in those documents at check-in.    We were also billed for $275 worth of mini-bar charges and were told the sensors had triggered those charges despite us not consuming those items (including $70 of wellness kits??).    Given the fact that our party was 6 men that spent a majority of our time gambling in Caesars casinos nonetheless there is no way that we would have agreed to pay $5000 for rooms that we spent minimal time in (essentially just to sleep) especially if we could have stayed in standard rooms free of charge. That was about the amount that we gambled so this doubled the price of our trip completely unexpectedly. While discussing this issue with the front desk at checkout we were informed that our rooms had been checked-out and there was nothing that the hotel could do to address the situation because the rooms had been checked out. This was yet again surprising to us as we had not finalized the check-out at the Kiosk which leaves us to believe that we were intentionally checked out during our discussions to squash the situation.    While we certainly enjoyed our stay at Caesars Palace as well as the gambling at various Caesars resorts (Caesars Palace Linq Harrah‚Äôs Flamingo etc.) the deceitful nature of these upgrades will certainly deter our entire group from staying at Caesars properties or gambling in their casinos moving forward.
30,Clean room good view of Belliago fountains. The strip is super busy you need a reservation to eat anywhere. Most restaurants are not open so super limited expensive food. You want to eat the buffet it‚Äôs 75.00. Per person. Gotta have a reservation. DO NOT gamble here games are horrible.
30,Upon arrival we were offered an upgrade for US$ 40 a night which we declined. The Front Desk Agent told us he was upgrading us with no cost to a larger and newer room so ok.  The room was nice in size clean but the view we got would have been great for the hotel‚Äôs Engineer with a great view of roofs AC ducts catwalks and other installations - a shame.  The room was not cleaned or made up on Sunday and Monday. Sunday we arrived late so we left it at that. Monday at 5 pm I went down to the front desk - I wasn‚Äôt able to talk to a human being at Guest ‚ÄúServices‚Äù on the phone although I tried 3 times. The gentleman there was very courteous and told me that they were handling room cleaning upon request - they should have told us upon checking in he deducted one day‚Äôs resort fee (US $50) for the inconvenience which was fine and told me they would send up some clean towels to the room - which never arrived.  There was also light bulb missing on one of the bedside lamps during the while of our stay not a big deal but not something I would expect from this type of hotel.  I must say though that the bed / mattress was super confortable and the overall installations and services are very good.  AF
30,"My flight got into LAS at 2100; so I arranged a mobile check-in through the Caesars Rewards app (which they recommended). Upon arrival I went to the kiosk to enter my information promptly at 2200 and was given the message that my room ""was not ready"". The party I was joining had dinner reservations at The Palm at 2200; so I had no choice but to drop my bags off in a friends room until after dinner.    After dinner I went to the front desk as the kiosks were closed to get checked-in. At this point it was after midnight. The person at the front desk was unapologetic and offered nothing but telling me that instead of trying to check in at the kiosk I should have come to the front desk.    Luckily I was with 2 other friends from dinner and one of them was adamant about getting something figured out since they were charged $75 earlier to check into their rooms 1 hour early.    The associate said he would go ""talk to his manager"" - returned and said all he could offer me was to compensate the $50 resort fee for that day."
30,We had a written bill of $45 per night to be held on credit card = $270 they held $500 charged $327. Called for housekeeping to get clean towels everyday never came. Had to call the conceirge each time to get clean towels. The line to get a taxi was the best run in Las Vegas. The beds were great. The rooms are almost 100% soundproof which is great.
20,First visit EVER to Vegas for... my BACHELORETTE party... our early check-in request was not available so me and my party of 7 had to get an emergency hotel for 12 hours because Caesars was going to sell me one at 4X the rate I reserved my suite for.  Finally get checked in online showed up went through express check-in got my keys and only opened the door to 1 room! Called supervisor on duty at front and security was to come and let us in.. Never showed. Bell Hop let's us in finally. We booked a VERY expensive suite in the tower with connecting room 2 beds only had 1 bed in that room. We had no sheets blankets or pillows for pull out couch so we had to divide sheets off beds so the whole party had necessities.  The next morning while preparing for our cabana day @$170hr might I add a man opens our door with a WORKING key! We 5 ladies are in towels and stunned. Front desk sold this man our suite! I had to go back downstairs and find out wth happened.    yes. They said sorry. Yes they charged me a discounted price for suite. BUT for my first experience and went big with CAESAR PALACE I was very sadly let down. I spent everyday of my 3Days dealing with some kind of debacle and really could never enjoy myself. I kept getting pulled away from my friends to deal with the issues and was alone.    Caeser's you could have done so much better and as a person that knows customer service y'all failed. questions or concerns I'm open to explain even more details bmayrowley@gmail.com
40,OK. Based on some of the recent reviews I was expecting a terrible stay. Thankfully this didn‚Äôt happen. It was a good one. I had booked my reservation online directly through the Caesars app. Got a great rate btw by booking early. Before my flight I checked in early via the app and by the time I landed I received a message my room was ready at 11 am. Once I arrived around 12:30pm I went straight to the kiosks and completed the check in. No early check in charge! Pays to not interact with humans. :). Room was awesome and clean. Maid service every other day. But I was expecting no service based on the previous reviews so‚Ä¶ Only gripe is the expensive food and coffee choices. Checked out other hotels including the Bellagio and they were less expensive. And a tip for those who want to have coffee in your room. Bring your own K cups. Not my favorite coffee type but got my day started. Also the pool is fully open now so no need to reserve ahead. Just go down early to get lounge chairs.
10,OMG...Where to begin.  1 Asked a housekeeper who was in the hallway to clean our room next she said she would do it.  It was not done.  2. Called housekeeping.  No answer for 20 minutes  3. Called the operator. She said she would call housekeeping.  No answer for 15 minutes.  4 Gave up on room cleaning and asked for towels  Nothing yet but only an hour so who knows...right?    For a supposedly luxury and certainly expensive place service is worse than terrible.    I suppose the new owners decided to save money by not re-hiring necessary staff.    Well they saved money and likely lost a customer who has lost much to their gambling.    My guess is that they don't give a damn.    So......Ok for one night but no longer if you want your room cleaned.    I am 100% sure that the owners do not care about this review
50,This was my first time at caesars palace the price was unbelievable the room 2677 had a great view of the different and strip. The room was large and very comfortable the staff was kind and attentive. The only complaint is the mini refrigerator don't open don't put anything in it or you will be charged. The keurig coffee pot had no cups. Why have it? There are other places to get coffee in caesars palace downstairs.
10,Worst hotel stay and service ever  Long lines for everything; check in bell service restaurant service pool service  Outdated hotel rodents running across the floor did a early check in and room was not clean & bed was well worn
30,I checked in on Tuesday my room wasn't cleaned until I called late Thursday. Hotel is not custo.er friendly no microwave. No refrigerator no coffee. No cups no user friendly essentials. A room with no amenities
20,We checked in at 10a the reps at desk didn‚Äôt have time to speak to us (although we were the only ones there). Forced to use the kiosk and was offered to pay 75$ for early check in didn‚Äôt know if we didn‚Äôt pay that we would have to wait around till 4 not a minute sooner to get our room. After working a 10hr shift at a hospital anda 4 hr flight and 7 hrs in the casino we get to the worst room ever. The phone/lamps didn‚Äôt work and the furniture looked as it was in a goodwill store. We complained and the next offered a different room BUT WE ONLY HAD 30 MINS to change rooms. The room was a little better. Getting a drink while playing was very difficult we had to buy our own at the gift shop. Cocktail waitress slim to none. Will think twice before I book this property again.
40,When we checked in which was very easy we were told they recommended not to gamble until we had a rewards card. The desk was closed when we got there. The next day the line was about an hour and it took about 30 minutes to get two cards that is crazy. Also tub drain didn‚Äôt work
50,Upon check-in Tomek helped us by putting us in an excellent room in the Augustus Tower. The employees at Caesars are working very hard during a pandemic which has greatly reduced the workforce in Vegas. Caesars staff did a great job of keeping up with a huge influx of tourists.
50,What an amazing stay at Caesars Palace. Palace Tower room. Having two bathrooms and the long hallway from the door to the bed made for quiet nights. Pool view. A day at the pool was relaxing and a blast. Easy check-in and check-out. Not a single complaint. Can‚Äôt wait to get back!
50,Check-in relatively quick & employees were professional & friendly. Stayed in room 2745 in the Palace Tower. Room was further from elevator but was very clean and updated. It was quiet & no problems in regards to this specific room. Keurig machine was provided without K-Cups I brought my own so that was fine. View was of TI/Mirage side. Pools were excellent as always. Spots were filling up quickly around noon but even after noon a lounger was always to be found. Would recommend & will return!
40,This property is amazing it's beautiful in every corner I enjoyed my stay my room was clean and the staff was friendly for the most part. My hat's off to Tangela at the front desk I had an issue with having to stay over due to my flight being canceled and she made the transition smooth. Also Paula won the attendance that worked my floor she did an awesome job and keeping our room up to par and clean.
50,The property is very nice unfortunately they have the worst service I have ever experienced up on arrival I was told to call the bell desk to have them bring our luggage to the room after waiting on hold for 45 minutes I decided to go in person I gave the claim ticket to the bellboy it took him 30 minutes to bring out my luggage I asked him if could please take it to my room and I was told that if I wanted for them them to take to my room I was going to have to wait an hour and a half so I had no choice but to do it my self.The pool area is very nice but they are under staff I also try to reach the front desk several times and every time after holding for 20 minutes you will get disconnected this is the only hotel I know that if you want to make any reservations you have to do it in person because you are not able to do it from your room
50,This hotel is one of my Favorites...i love everything about it...and the luxury ..is the best. i would recomend it to everyone..The pools are amazing.!! The money is super well worthy..i will come back again.
20,We booked this trip through our Host to remain nameless although I should let you know that too. However I had an offer to come to Las Vegas for up to 7 nights. I had earned the nights through play at my home casino in Indiana. I called to book this offer as I was having issues booking it myself. I talked t my host about the fact that I wanted to have a nice room in Vegas as I got a choice on which resort I could stay at for this offer. She told me that Caesars would be the best place to stay as it is their best maintained resort. I have been there a couple of times before and I thought it would be a nice place as well. My host asked if I wanted close to the elevator I said that would be nice. and she said she would request a high floor number room. I got there and I got room #5422 thinking it would be on the 50th floor it was actually 4th floor as the numbering starts at 50 in this wing. I was pretty close to the elevator. That was about the best thing I can say about this room. It was very old and it looked like it. The cabinets were really scratched up badly and the top drawer did not want to close. the wallpaper was peeling in the stool area of the bathroom and the view there was of the rooftops of the buildings around it. The shower had two different shower heads a rainfall one and a normal one I thought that would be nice however the control knob to switch from one setting to the other was stuck in a halfway position between both so neither put out too much pressure. I tried turning it. The room was clean and I did not have an issue with that until we were there a couple of days and wanted to get new towels. We left the room around 10:30 AM and turned on the service light and left for the day. we got back around 11:30PM and no one came to service the room. I called for towels and it took 1 hour for them to show up. We were going all day long and this is an exorbitant amount of time for towels to be delivered in my opinion. I almost called to cancel them as we were worn out and ready for bed. The Gentleman shows up to deliver the towels and I explain that we were supposed to have the room cleaned today and no one showed up. I asked if we needed to do anything different as I wanted the room cleaned. He spoke broken English and asked if I wanted the room cleaned now. I said no I don't want my room cleaned at 1AM. I want it cleaned for tomorrow. He said he would pass along the information and let the manager know that it was supposed to be cleaned and it wasn't. I thanked him for his help. The next day we left a little after 11am and left the light on for service and left for the day again. There were people close to my room cleaning the rooms in my hallway when we left. We got back this time about 6:30 or 7PM and no one had cleaned our room once again. I was upset and went to talk with someone about this issue. I went to the diamond and 7 star check in area. I waited my turn as others there were just checking into the hotel. While I was waiting 2 different people came in and went right to the counter to speak to a man working there. They had both been to their roos and their keys did not work. And they had to deal with that issue. I spoke with a lady about the issue. She asked if I wanted to send someone to clean my room. I said I already called house keeping before coming to speak to her and they said they had no idea when they might even be able to get to it. I told her this is horrible service I had at this point been in the hotel 4 nights and no service. She told me they were short staffed and that they could not clean every room every day. I told her we put in a request 2 days in a row and neither had been done and that it seemed as though they only wanted to clean the rooms for the new incoming guest as we were already there. She apologized and offered to give me comps for food and drink. I told her it was so busy we could barely get into a restaurant there. She offered to move my room as well but we only had about 48 hours until we left and I did not want to pack everything up and repacked and spend our vacation time moving rooms. She said she would comp the nights stay. I told her that would be great. She scheduled someone to clean our room and when we got back it was done. This was the only service we got for the 6 night stay. Then I leave and as we check out the bill shows 0.00 . Perfect until we are back to Indiana and I get an updated billing for the nights charge plus something from the minibar. I have no idea what that was as we never buy that overpriced crap. I have a rental car for the entire time and we go out daily to avoid paying for all the restaurants that overcharge. No way did we use the minibar. And today to date I have not gotten in touch with the Hotel as I was on hold for over half an hour and I finally left my number and I was supposed to stay in the que in the same position and someone would call me back. I have not heard from anyone and it has been about an hour and a half since I hung up. I would have hated to be on hold for 2 hours and still not be helped. I probably won't get a return call because I am sure they are short handed. Does anyone else think Covid is now just an excuse for bad service????
50,I have to say this place is super relaxed and all they want you to do is have fun and relax. Of course all the rules still apply but they‚Äôre not super strict. Again they want you to enjoy yourself and relax. I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience. The pool (21up) is amazing! It‚Äôs huge and the water temp is perfect not to mention it‚Äôs salt water not chlorine. Love it!  Also to note that even though it‚Äôs mostly smoking in the casino the air filtration is great. I have zero complaints. Oh love the free parking and zero resort fees. That‚Äôs huge! You could pay up to $40-60 at other resorts or hotels.    Thanks again for the funner experience!!!
10,With the recent opening of Nevada my girlfriend and I decided to visit Caesar‚Äôs Palace which we have never stayed before. I have stayed in Las Vegas and many other resorts including the Encore Paris Venetian and the Trump. My first impression of Caesars was it's always a classy place to go and receive high quality hospitality. It looked great in the movie the Hangover right? However our recent stay was terrible our room was beat up nothing worked in it. Electric Curtains did not work TV in the Bathroom did not work and f you want to use the Fridge in the room to store some items they will charge you $75. They now charge you $20.00 for cocktails and for breakfast at the Caf√© Americano for two people cost $100 (just for eggs benedict and an American breakfast with orange juice) . This is not the way to welcome back those that want to spend their money to revitalize Las Vegas. We arrived around 11:00 AM from Southern California and tried to check in and was told that we could check in early for $50 fee we opted out of that and they would text us when our cards were ready around 4:00 PM. Once we got our text at 4:00 PM we went to the check-in desk to find there were hundreds of unhappy people all waiting in line for either someone at the desk or to use a kiosk. We spent over an hour in line. This is not what we want to do with our vacation time and money we spend. My recommendation is stay away from Caesar‚Äôs go someplace else that has better rooms hotel management operational management and cares about the experience of their guests. Don‚Äôt get fleeced with their outrageous prices! (We were there from Sunday to Tuesday).
50,Checked in and was taken care of by Princess. She was pretty dope and quick to getting me in my room. I checked in REALLY late so I was offered a late check in which was pretty nice of her. She was very attentive and I was happy to see her step in when the line was getting long. Great job Caesars for hiring star quality people!
10,I stayed in a suite that was over $200 a night and couldn't use the fridge without being charged additional $75. Room service sucked  couldn't get blankets needed after repeatedly asking sofa bed had toys in it so wasn't cleaned properly only 2 ppl can use wifi in 24 hour period without being charged for that. TV didn't work in bathroom none of the phones worked in the room. I had to text room service  didn't like that. The room had dressers that were old and chipped. My room was really far from the pools and I told registration I wanted to swim mainly. Parking is not free even though you have a room there. First time ever and last time going there. I will stick with the resorts. I couldn't find the club nobody knew  it was my birthday treat to myself and I regret it!
10,This was my husband and I‚Äôs first trip to Las Vegas. We were so excited to have the opportunity to stay at Caesars Palace! Unfortunately I have to leave this review about our stay. We had an issue with our room because we had an expectation that the room would clean and nice. There was something spilled on the floor boards by the door I‚Äôll glass I drank out of had a cut in it and there were multiple scuff marks around the room. Furniture was old and nicked. I took several pictures and showed the front desk. They promised me money refunded. However when I checked out I noticed I had A $20 charge on my account for supposedly using something in the room from the refrigerator. I also did not see any credit that I was promised for having a room that was unclean and oldÔøº. I love Las Vegas but unfortunately they could not move me because the hotel was booked. I will not return to stay at Caesars Palace because it was a huge disappointment.Ôøº I have tried to call four different people and I still have not been refunded my money.Ôøº
20,Paid 3x for suite w/jacuzzi tub & fountain view only to find no tub a cheesy hand held shower and if you crane your neck & look past the rooftop trash maybe a glimpse of 1/4 of the fountain. Best they could do: ‚Äúsorry here‚Äôs $30‚Äù on $1500 room
10,Have always loved Caesars  this time I was super disappointed with them and their service... was not up to par  expect more from Caesars and they didn‚Äôt deliver ! From the time we got to valet  to the time we checked out and all in between did not meet the expectations I have to come to expect from Caesars !
20,Our standard king room looked nothing like the clean beautiful picture that we booked. Bed was very comfortable but after that not good. For a $250+ room to have old tore up furniture in it is ridiculous. The door of the fridge cabinet was half hanging off and the shower door wouldn't even seal properly. The rooms and the casino could use an overhaul. Casino is very dark and drab. Definitely not worth the money.
30,During my trip to Vegas I stayed both at Caesar‚Äôs Palace and the Venetian. Throughout my review I‚Äôll give pros and cons of Caesar‚Äôs and provide comparisons to the Venetian.    Pros:  - Location on the strip: Great location in the center of the strip. Walkable to nearly every other casino / resort on the strip. A little better location than the Venetian (which is a few blocks further North) but both are in great spots.  - Resort/rooms: The resort is immaculate. The lobby pool casino ‚Äî all amazing. We had a Palace Premium Studio with a pool view. The room was updated spotlessly clean and comfortable. The location of the Palace tower was ideal ‚Äî not directly off the casino floor but only a short walk and at the entrance to the pool. And despite the lively chaos that Vegas brings our room was peaceful and quiet. The pool closes at 6 PM so no need to think twice about possibilities of being awaken from late night pool debauchery. As compared the the Venetian I‚Äôd call this a tie - both are incredible and ornate.    Cons:  - Check-in: Check-in is at 4:00 PM and not a minute earlier without a $75 early check-in fee. We arrived at 3:20 PM and were told that although our room was ready we had to pay the fee or return at 4:00. When we returned at 4:00 it took us 45 minutes to get through the line (perhaps to be expected since the entire hotel was told to check-in at the same time). And since you cannot check-in you do not have a room key to use the pool or other amenities that your $50 daily resort fee goes towards. I stayed at the Venetian the second leg of my Vegas trip and they allow you to check-in (without a fee) anytime after 9:00 AM.  - Pool bar service: While the Caesar‚Äôs pools are undoubtedly beautiful the poolside service is severely lacking. On Memorial Day the bar had only one bartender which had lines for a drink or food backing up 20-25 minutes at times. There were also very few servers taking orders around the pool. In the 2 hours I was at the pool a server didn‚Äôt once ask if I needed to place an order. Clearly understaffed for the capacity. For $11 beers and $20 cocktails lousy service and long lines for a drink is unacceptable. When I stayed at the Venetian later during my trip there were 3x as many bartenders and servers which allowed for more prompt and attentive service.    All things considered I had a comfortable stay at Caesar‚Äôs Palace. However I felt nickel and dimed at check-in and found the poolside bar and beverage service to be below expectations. I had a much better experience on both fronts while at the Venetian a few days later. When I return to Vegas if the price between the two resorts was similar I‚Äôd stay at the Venetian.
20,When we checked in we were downgraded without compensation. They failed to tell us that they didn't accept AMEX. WIFI was unavailable and jaccuzi was broken. There were no concierge services which left us on our own. Since they wouldn't accept my credit card no food at Ceasars or gambling as planned. All we had was an expensive place to lay our head.
20,I was excited to stay in this hotel but found myself really disappointed due do the lack of cleanliness crowdedness and expensiveness (there are extra fees for literally everything including the use of the pool). There was black mold in the shower you could see footprints on the bathroom floor from the previous occupants and the hallways and elevators smelled terrible. Food options are limited insanely priced and lines were long. I'm thankful my husband and I only booked one night here - I couldn't wait to get out of this place. I will never stay at Caesar's Palace again and would also advise others to stay elsewhere.
10,Dissatisfied  Checked in at Diamond Services. Had a 2 bedroom premium room in the Octavius Tower. Went to room and I could not believe what shape the room was in. Headboards shredding dirty floor desk and tv stand all nicked up. I thought I was in a motel 8. Went back to Diamond services showed pics and requested to be put in a different tower. They wouldn‚Äôt move me without me paying an additional fee. Changed rooms in same tower only for it to look the same. No apology and certainly not loyal to there loyal customers. Very disappointed in the direction Caesar‚Äôs Properties is going in. Never again
50,"At the point of arriving in Las Vegas my husband and I completed a 31-day cross country drive around America. When I booked the Premium Augustus King room at Cesar's - I had no idea what was in store for us. The gentleman at the check in counter said he had an ""upgrade' for us. We thought that was wonderful. But when we got to the Suite OH MY GOODNESS .... it was a 2000 sq ft Suite on the 27th floor. It had a double-door entry forier with 2 & 1/2 bathrooms! It was so very grand. What a fabulous end to the last night of our journey. The room was 2734 - if anyone wants to request it !! The King bed was the MOST comfortable bed we have slept in. (Including ours at home). We were truly blessed with the stay!!"
30,Shower from room next door leaked into our bathroom each day. Room service only the first night. Last day as we packed room service kept coming in from 9:30 to 10:45 at least 3 times. Tried to use luggage rack to bring in our bags. Was told this isn‚Äôt a holiday inn and we can‚Äôt just take those. Had to park so far away and carry our luggage through casino to hotel. Food prices are outrageous! $45 for a pizza!!! Way to big and where are bathrooms in casino? No free drinks offered to me once while playing machines.
40,For the most part our stay was nice.  Our first room 885 in the Julius tower had a disappointing view with no tub.  I booked this trip for the first time without a travel agent our local agency closed due to covid so I realized that was probably my own fault.  However after 2 nights we were offered an upgrade in the Augustus tower  room 2556 for only 15 dollars a night.  That room was perfect.  Some down sides to the hotel was no trash bags in the room or clean up services during the day and we had to call for fresh towels instead of getting a daily check and refresh of the room.  Also when I wanted cash to try a bit of gambling the ATM fees was outrageous so I passed on the whole experience due to a 10 dollar fee.  The lines just to get a coffee were also frustrating.   I don't remember waiting or going without a coffee due to the lines being an issue in the previous 4 trips to Vegas I have taken.  The hotel staff were extremely nice and I felt all the areas were clean and beautiful.
20,Check in any hotel in Las Vegas has always been a tedious task same was at this time. If one checks before noon they would generally say they have no rooms ready but if you pay $100 early check in charge then suddenly ample rooms become available. Particularly this time even though my room contract included everyday housekeeping I did not have one even though I stayed there for 3 nights. It took me 25 minutes to get an housekeeping assistant on the phone who promised me that they are still not done doing all the rooms (at 5.30PM) and someone should be there shortly. Well I came back to the room at 9.30PM and still no one came to clean and make the bed. Same thing the next day. No apologies no reduction in the room charges (some hotels in Vegas now quote room charges without housekeeping and they charge separately on the days you request one). These guys they charged and did not provide and charged me extra for early check in. Thieves!
50,Yesterday we visited the Caesar's Rewards desk to ask a few questions regarding our Caesar's account. As our questions were complex Lisa was asked to assist us. Lisa really took her time and made us feel like valued guest. She was able to address all items in a very positive professional manner. Lisa offered excellent customer service and an awesome happy attitude. Kudo's to LISA - she's a great Caesar's brand representative!
50,This review is for the manager Lisa at the Caesars rewards desk in Las Vegas. I had a hiccup with my Caesars rewards status and Lisa was able to get back to me within 24hrs resolving the issue. She went above and beyond in taking care of the situation. Thank you for the outstanding customer service.
40,Caesars is the best but still a lot closed and long wait times for the places that are open. Also I don‚Äôt care for the no maid service was there for a week and they didn‚Äôt clean the room once I had to ask for some clean towels they sent me a bag of towels - kinda weird also large room and resort fee per day with really no justification- $52 a day resort and $58 room fee and they can‚Äôt make the bed and put in some fresh towels and soap
40,Caesars is always a special place in which too much is just right. Caesars is always wonderful. They have 7 pools and more glitter than the mardi gras. I have just one complaint: the hours of the fitness enter.  The fitness center has a good collection of machines and toys but I do not understand why hours are limited to 9:30-4/ I was traveling t on business and was committed to work 8:30-6 or 6:30. Yet their fitness center is limited to the hours of of 7 to 4. It makes it really hard to squeeze in a workout and a shower. I hope with the growing tourism they will consider expanading their hours.
50,Loved the hotel. It is very big very fancy and with all kinds of attractions and restaurants and shops. You could spend a whole week here and eat at all the places. We are not so much buffet people so we did the restaurants and were not disappointed. The location is great right on the strip
30,In the 3 nights we stayed there housekeeping did not clean our room once despite us being away for long lengths of time and putting the ‚Äúattention required‚Äù notice on the door/room. Also a silver-dollar-sized hole in one of the walls in our room.
10,Checked in to a very filthy room with black dust covering the wall switches feces ON the toilet seat a phone so covered in muck I‚Äôll likely require a vaccination from having handled it and a staff lacking in concern and ability... (With the exception of the lovely folk assisting with luggage. They were superb). All else was so far below par I can‚Äôt even describe it further. Also no valet a room directly next to the elevator and facing Flamingo (VERY noisy/loud). Such a disappointment. Checked out immediately after a severe thunderstorm disappointing conversation with their ‚Äúguest services‚Äù. üòï
50,Cesar palace was a very luxury nice room with the perfect view Cesar palace is my number one hotel in Las Vegas thank you Cesar palace..The only thing that was missing was a refrigerator it will be nice to have one of those next time.
10,I am a police officer from Texas for over 32 years and completely understand policies.  I was embarrassed first by being locked out of my room.  Second by being rudely treated at the front desk when I tried to get my keys and third when I was escorted back to my room by tthreesecurity guards and a third to retrieve my pistol that was in my room.  Apparently the cleaning woman saw it and reported it.  I understand that one of the three security guards told me SEVERAL times that it is policy on the strip to not allow firearms in the room.  He stated the policy has been in effect since 2017.  Well no one stated that to me at check-in and being from Texas I didn't get notified of Caesar's policy that licensed officers from other states can't bring their firearm into their room.  I'm being facetious but the problem is if no one notifies me at check-in you are now asking me for my weapon I have carried for work and self protection for over 32 years!! The issue was further exacerbated when I willing gave up my firearm in my room and was told I had to be escorted by 3 security guards back down to lock it up. I explained I wasn't doing that and they can take my firearm give me a receipt and I was good with that.  I was then told they would call Las Vegas Metro Police and they would take my firearm and secure it and I could check it out from them.  Well I am sure Las Vegas Metro does not act as a property room for Caesars Palace and I told your security guard to call them.  He didn't and I explained to him it's not good to make idle threats.  I didn't abandon my weapon and voluntarily released it but was forced to walk down to security  under guard to secure my weapon.  I cannot overemphasize the embarrassment I felt after I was locked out.  I explained I was a peace officer from Texas and was rudely told everyone  Secret Service FBI and other officers are made to do the same.  I didn't have much choice since I was told I would be asked to leave if I didn't walk my firearm down to the security office.  I asked to speak to a manager and was told the security guards were managers.  I asked if I am told to leave would I be compensated for the two nights I have already paid for? I was then told they aren't managers and I would have to go to the front desk to speak to a manager about that.  I asked to do that but was told they were going to deal with the issue of my firearm first.   I decided to walk down with the security guards and then was escorted back
20,Do NOT come to Caesars Palace at this time. The check in was beyond comprehension- stood in line for a half hour to check in. Then was told we could pay $75 to get into our room right then (1:00 pm) or wait until 4:00. We chose that as we went for lunch. Came back at 4:00 to get keys- had to stand in line again for 30 minutes. Just for our keys!  Now day 2 without housekeeping. Yesterday at 3:30 we told the maid to just give us clean towels. Today after texting with their online concierge I finally had to hunt down a cart with clean towels toilet paper and a bin to empty our garbage (see picture) That was at 4:30.  Don‚Äôt come here until they get post-Covid things figured out. And we pay a resort fee???!!!
50,Everything is good except waiting for check-in  It is in a great location the room was clean and the hotel facilities are all great downstairs you find all kind of foods the pool was fantastic regarding the casino we were not lucky at all that day may 31st 2021.
30,I did not like the fact that we did not have a fridge or microwave in the room. It was only two elevators working to get to and from our room the entire stay the other 4 were down leaving the wait time very long to get to and from the room.
20,Well It is hard to know where to start with this trip. When checking in we were greeted by people who clearly are not enjoying their job. We then were presented with a room that had not been cleaned. How do I know? Because glitter and blood on the sheets is not what we call clean. YUCK! We were late for dinner because we had to supervise the housekeeping staff in our room and watch them change the entire bedding. We had to make several calls to get this accomplished. No one ever followed up with us about this complete fall down on their part.  Do you LOVE the smell of marijuana? Well you are in luck! Non-stop marijuana smoke at this casino. We gambled exclusively at the Bellagio and the Wynn because they have figured out the magic of removing smoke from the casino and hotel.  We will not return. This hotel does not look like it has had any type of renovation since 2017 and it shows. The entire place is dated and gross.
20,We usually stay here because we love the pool and their customers is great. All I can say is front desk check in has poor customer service and the manager hector was not accommodating at all. I had called prior to upgrade my room from a king bed to a 2 queens bedroom. The customer service lady said that once I check in at the hotel that they will take care of that no problem. We have the caesers reward app as well and they offered the upgrade there too. When we went to check in we were told they had no available to accommodate our request. Hector the manager then stepped in and just brushed what I had explained to him off. So it was what it was at that point for us. It was 1pm and they told us to check in early that we still have to pay early check in. I mean at that point you would think he would wave the fee for the inconvenience but no he said he couldn‚Äôt do anything. It was disappointing especially because we are frequent visitors with ceaser and are loyal caesers reward members too.
30,They do not follow directions in regards to billing. I had comps and wanted to use them for my charges not my charge card. I went over this over and over and was told that I could use my comps and it would not be placed on my charge card.  Well you guessed it they charged my account. It is hard to get someone on the phone and their inquires take at least 5 days for a response if you are lucky.
50,I reserved two suites and when I attempted to check-in using the kiosk only one of them was ready. I then spoke with the two attendants (Moses P. and Daniel P.) at the small podium and they were FANTASTIC! Moses gave us an upgrade for each suite and made sure we were on the same floor since we couldn't be beside one another. This was my best check-in experience at Caesars as well as any other resort/hotel I've ever had. Great job guys!
40,I loved my room. The view of the Bellagio fountains was amazing . The only downside was check in. I used the express check in and still did in line around 45 minutes. I would have gotten here earlier had I known that. When I walked into my room the wait in line was well worth it. Very pleased. Hopefully I'll be back
10,Worse long weekend I spent in Las Vegas. Express check in took me 2 hours to get my room key- and I think I was early on the line.    Results of management taking advantage of an early check in fee of 70$ before 4pm. So what will you expect hundred of customers weee checking in after 4pm- bottle neck  resulting with an unsatisfied customer. I Regret that this was my first and last using Caesar‚Äôs palace- never get an old hotel.  There were senior citizens on the line and I feel bad for them with temp. On the high 90‚Äôs -100s.. pretty sure some will pass out soon ! There were no water available for that long wait!    Avoid this hotel !
50,We stayed in a Palace Premium Studio king May 27-31. First time staying at Caesars Palace. The resort is a monstrosity as others mention in reviews. We arrived about 10am for early check-in. Kiosk check-in went smooth requested housekeeping at check-in also opted to use IVY the personal text assistant.    Could not find our elevator bank; apparently we cannot follow the directions provided haha. Asked security for directions; we were over by Almalfi and the security personnel walked us all the way to the Palace elevator bank; great service!!    Our room was on the 27th floor almost the end of the hall. Room is as depicted in the pictures. Very clean spacious. The room did not show signs of wear and tear; the only flaws would be one of the closet doors did not close flush (three closets) and the vent in the bathroom needs to be dusted otherwise very immaculate room. The shower has two doors and two shower heads. One of the bathrooms has a jetted soaking tub and a bidet. Made use of both lol!    Requested additional bath towels via IVY they were delivered within 30 minutes. Since we got the towels so quick we kept the occupied sign on the door thus no need for housekeeping. I thought the bed was great my husband felt it was too soft for him. I did not care for the pillows husband did.    We brought our own K-cups to use but since we smoke and drink more than a couple cups of coffee each morning we only made our own coffee once. In the mornings we would have our coffee play the slots and smoke. Did not want to make the trek back to the room every time we needed more coffee so we just ordered from Brioche. The cost of a black coffee is about double what you would pay at Starbucks however they are open 24hrs and we are early risers especially with a two hour time difference.    Bought our drinks from one of the Essentials shops apparently I made so many trips in there the cashier remembered my name the next day! For the amount of people staying and visiting the resort it was kept very very clean in public places. Never once did we have to wait for more than a minute for an elevator. Went to the pool Sunday morning got loungers in the Apollo Pool due to wanting shade. The pool was busy every day but Sunday morning guests must have been nursing some massive hangovers because it didn't get hopping until after noon. Drinks are expensive at the pool. Ordered a spicy caesar and a dole whip $60 + tip. I had two dole whips those are excellent!!    Our floor (27) was clean and quiet. Never heard doors shutting no loud parties nothing. Lots of guests but very well behaved! Didn't even smell the devils lettuce on our floor; casino and public smoking areas- yes it was prevalent. Had reservations for the buffet on Sunday. There was a long stand-by line for those who did not make reservations (don't know how many got in). We were seated right away. The buffet did not blow me away; good but I honestly felt it did not live up to the hype. Service however was excellent.Spent some time in the Alto bar the MonteCristo bar and Joe's seafood. Again great service.    Excellent hospitality and service from every single employee we interacted with. Very clean property. Drink service on the casino floor was hit or miss but considering the crowds for the Memorial Day weekend the cocktail waitresses and bartenders can only do so much.    Opportunity for improvement: given the size of this property and the amount of guests served there needs to be a lot more food options after 1030pm. More quick service or fast-casual that can feed us at any hour of the day. There just really isn't anything.    Overall based on our room type tower personal interactions and experience at Caesars I would highly recommend staying here.
20,We‚Äôre charged a resort fee each day for poor service. Check in took 45 min and it was very difficult to find a server in the casino. Rooms were also not cleaned each day. WiFi was not reliable. For the resort fee you pay the service is not good. Especially considering you cannot use the mini fridge in your room without being charged an extra fee (have stayed in hundreds of hotels and never not had access to a complimentary refrigerator). We do not plan to go back to this resort for the prices we paid.    For a company in the service industry they seem to forget the customer should leave happy and not frustrated with slow lines short staffing lack of basic complimentary hotel services. Making everything inconvenient/cost extra for the customer is going to cause people to spend their money elsewhere on the strip.
40,The wife and I visited Caesar's Palace May 22-29 2021. We booked a Palace Premium Studio Suite and it was a great choice! Two separate bathrooms connected by a walk thru shower was an excellent design. The hotel restaurants and shops were all clean. We only had two small complaints about the hotel (other than the overpowering cigarette smell once you got to the ground floor which I know they can not prevent). The first complaint is that the WiFi sucked. It is a part of your mandatory resort fees and half the time I simply used cellular service because it was faster and easier. The second complaint is that if you have a pool view room get ready for the gas blowers cleaning the pool area at 6am ish every day! We were on the 14th floor and could hear it clearly. We did not use the pool or casino so I can not comment on them. Overall we had a great experience at Caesar's and would surely return.
10,Caesars Palace is not living up to it‚Äôs reputation of a palace. We stayed in the Augustus Tower overlooking the Bellagio hotel fountain and the Strip. Our room was huge but in a state of disrepair and the carpeting next to the bed was soaked. When we called maintenance the solution was to place towels on the massive wet carpet. Extra towels were provided at no charge so that my husband and I could swap them out. We were also given cheap slippers to wear so our feet would not get wet. Not once was a new room or upgrade suggested by management. We then found that the hot tub and shower did not work. The hot tub was looked at but nothing done as we were told the hot tubs were old and parts could not be found. Again no offer of a new room by management. I requested a new room however we moved into the new room no help of Caesar's staff. In addition get ready to be charged for any customary commodities including room coffee maker coffee (21$) poolside (75-400$)‚Ä¶We were disappointed. My advice look elsewhere.
40,Room was clean and nice and great location  Disappointed at them having a coffee machine in the room but had to purchase an expensive coffee package at the mini bar if you wanted to use it. Bring your own k-cups or pay $8 a cup of coffee downstairs. Not a huge amount of money just the principle of it when we paid alot for the room and $51/nite resort fee and gamble there they can't provide free coffee. Feel ripped off.  They also charge $75 if you use the mini fridge for personal use. They should have one for us to use like every other (even much less expensive) hotel has
10,What should have been a great vacation with family turned out to be a horrible experience. We stayed at this property for a week and had to beg for our room to be cleaned. Make a request with housekeeping is what they said only to be told that check-out guest are a priority for room cleaning. They dropped a bag of sheets in front of my door and basically told me to do it myself. I work for Marriott so I totally understand coming back to some sort of normalcy but I was a paying guest in this resort that was not cheap at all and treated like I wasn‚Äôt valued. I finally got my room cleaned the last day before check out and that took me calling repeatedly I would never ever recommend this property to anyone if this is how you treat your guest coming over Covid-19 restrictions then it is a no for me. This property was only looking to book to capacity but not properly available to accommodate paying guest due to limited staffing. Zandra from front desk was amazing she greeted us with smiles and her customer service was off the chain she truly made our check-in experience great. We love you Zandra thanks for being amazing.
50,I really enjoyed this hotel!! I was worried that it was going to packed and noisy and trashy from reading some of the reviews but I was wrong. The biggest issue I had was that there was a time period for about 2 days that they only had ONE elevator working during my stay but the hotel was nice and quiet and just beautiful. I mean look at these pictures!!! Enjoy your stay!
20,We were so jazzed to stay here and while the rooms were very nice the LONG wait (30 minutes +) for each trip of the elevator killed our experience. Only 2 of the 6 elevators in our tower were working for the general public.    We won‚Äôt be back.
20,Forum tower is the last to be renovated it‚Äôs old and dirty; it‚Äôs a money grab before they renovation. Food services and experiences are over priced. For the cost value might as well stay at the Wynn.
20,Not sure if because of pandemic rules or whatever but couldn't get my room cleaned even though called and requested. So my room was filthy throughout my entire stay the bath tub wouldn't drain. I had to beg to even get toilet tissue for the room and when it arrived it was just in a plastic shopping bag left hanging on the door.    Food options were decent but they were either super expensive or the customer service was terrible. Particularly at Pronto by Giada.
40,Veteran Vegas goer here. Stayed at Caesars 4 years ago was the last time. We stayed here the week of May 25 2021. Some things are completely back to normal such as no mask requirements no social distancing requirements and all of the shops and bars seemed to be open. If you know what you are walking into you won't be so surprised. You know long gone are the days of cheap eats and drinks with on the spot player comps. The Disney land Amusement park is full strength now; Many of the properties maxing out a famous Chef name or reality star label to pump up prices 50% or more. Vanderpump and Bobby Flay are two that readily come to mind. Enjoy the strip but its prudent to spend most time away from it especially when spending.  -bring your K cups for coffee  -avoid the fridge and know you will not have it or a microwave a compacting cooler is what I bring. Free ice is still available. But free water is tougher to come by. Hit up the store.  -rent a car as Uber and Cab rates are out of this world  -eat off the strip always. countless wonderful places which you can find in my other reviews  -prepare in advance for your pool time and pay the $75 for a bed if you want a good location at the pool. Otherwise expect a cot wherever you might find one.    Our room in Augustus came as advertised from my wonderful hostess Martha Landeros who did an excellent job in accommodating our needs which changed 3 times. So a big thank you to her. 7 star/Diamond check in took 20 minutes at the most and came with 5 free waters. I immediately requested extra towels and pillows which arrived in less than 20 minutes too. This was great service.    Not a lot of time is spent in the room but the toilet was a bit low to the ground for me. I don't mind it usually if there is a handle but for someone over 6 foot might find it an issue especially if you have knee or hip pain. The Vent was also dirty in there. My biggest issue was the TV set up...which I didn't get a picture of but from the bed you can't see the entire TV. About 6 inches is cutoff from the shelving on the left side of the entertainment center. It should be more centered. The biggest disappointment came when the Laurel lounge was not operating. We weren't made aware of this so when arriving for the first experience and seeing the operating hours in plain daylight well it was pretty upsetting. This should be upfront upon check in. After all the Buffett was open gain so I'm not sure if the Laurel lounge was a staffing issue or what.  I am battling a few fraudulent charges to my credit card that was charged by one or two of the restaurants found in Caesar's. I'll handle that in a separate review. Overall the Caesars Palace hotel was good resting place despite a few hiccups.
40,We are Diamond members and Eric at the Diamond checkin was so kind and helpful! He made sure we were comfortable with our stay. When we got to the room in the Julius Tower the room was very dated and dusty. I asked for our room to be serviced through Ivy and it never was. We are tidy people and kept it picked up as best we could. That was the only issue with our stay. The room had not been used in quite some time and there was dust on everything. The dust bunnies were starting to settle on the items on the mini bar. I can‚Äôt say enough how amazing Eric was!! Thank you!
20,Will not stay at Caesars again. My wife told me after we left she cleaned hair up in the shower before the rest of the family saw it. Didn't tell me until we had left or I would have made them at least clean the bathroom right away. There is a frigde in the room but they say if you use it you will be charged for what is in it. Also have to be careful not to bump the dresser with the snacks because it is on a scale so they will charge you if anything is disturbed. $51.02 resort fee that only covers 2 devices on the wifi ($14.99 for each additional device per day). Did get to the pool one day but still have to pay the resort fee for the other 2 days plus $50 for a bucket of 5 beers at the pool seems pretty high. Booked travel through Southwest Vacations so didn't get any of the Ceasers rewards for the hotel room because it wasn't book through them. Never again. Only thing that is good is the location on the strip.
50,Spending our first stay in Vegas at such an iconic property did not disappoint. Perfect location with proximity to resorts  shopping etc. Loved the pool areas. I only wish there were more late night dining options.
30,Paid in advance for upgrade never got a room that I paid for. When I talked to the manager he said everything was sold out at the time and I have to stay in the room that I was assigned to. Not cool didnt get my money back also not like it matter for those 20-30$ but still not nice of them.
50,It was a sister trip and we had a wonderful time at the hotel. Location was perfect and the View from the room was amazing. The only thing I wasn‚Äôt very happy is that everyone was able to smoke at the hotel.
10,I stay in the Octavius Tower high floor end room. Quiet at end of hall. Facing pool. Room almost always cold. I order an extra blanket and I am in my happy place. VIP check in is great efficient and I can come to them with a rare problem. Shower excellent and room is large and comfortable. Was there during Shavuot for two night. My go to hotel for excellent service.
40,My buddy and I stayed at Caesar's May 24-28. I am a Diamond level member of the Caesars reward program.    We arrived on Monday May 28 around 3:00. There was a huge line at check in but fortunately as a diamond there was a separate room for checking in. Check in was seamless and reflected previously made reservations.  We were assigned a room in the Augustus tower. The 37th floor room had the best view of any that I have seen on any stay in Vegas. It overlooked the Bellagio fountains and the strip.    The room itself was quite large and included two comfortable queen size beds small couch nice upholstered chair small table very nice HDTV with a myriad of channels and cabinet with adequate drawers. There was a fridge but we dared not open for fear of being charged. There was a small safe in the closet. The bathroom was quite large and included a wonderful shower as well as bath tub (which we did not use but appeared to have jacuzzi jets). As we expected there was no housekeeping during our stay but we easily were able to obtain extra towels.    The property was in good shape but now we come to the only issue which caused me to downgrade the review from 5 to 4. We utilized the pool facilities each day. Of the 6 or so pools half were unheated. Seriously with the amount that people pay for a resort fee you cannot heat the pools? The Neptune pool which would have been my preferred pool for swimming required polar bear outwear...It was freezing. Two other pools were cold but not as cold as the Neptune pool. The circular pool was generously heated and was what I used for swimming though certainly not optimal. The pool by the bar was also heated probably because it had swim up blackjack. The other heated pool (Venus) could only be accessed if you rented a cabana daybed or lounge chair.    The casino had a myriad of slots though curiously not many of the newer ones I saw in other casinos. No big thing but curious.    Restaurants were quite expensive as to be expected. We did have the opportunity to eat at the Bacchanal Buffet. Thank goodness I was able to use the $100 credit as a diamond for the $70/ pp charge. While the service was impeccable and the open table reservation worked like a charm we were shocked that all the so called heated entrees and side dishes were either lukewarm or room temperature.    Overall we enjoyed our stay and were only disappointed by pools and Bacchanal buffet. The diamond desk personnel were wonderful.    Just a side note less than 10% of the visitors wore masks while 100% of the staff did.
20,I called four times for towels I didn‚Äôt ask for my room to be cleaned or anything else and every time they said they bring them I never got a clean towel. Complained to management and STILL no clean towels!
50,"We booked a couple of pricey rooms for our family's first group getaway now that pandemic conditions are clearing. Emma showed top levels of service and professionalism even in the midst of the peak check-in crush of the first ""post-pandemic"" long weekend to help us upgrade to a two-bedroom penthouse suite that would greatly help the family to spend more time together at no additional cost. Service like this makes the difference between a good vacation and a great one. Thanks Emma!"
40,No priority lines unless your Seven Star even as a Diamond Plus Only in the poker room did the staff upgrade your position on the waiting list Thanks James for your kindness it is appreciated  As for laurel lounge drink coupons very limited use if your a non alcoholic beverage person. Also the lines to use it at the Starbucks location are 15-30 minutes at all times of day.  Hearing rumors and no factual information from corporate on the decision to reopen the Laurel lounge?  Why not just tell us the truth if your not going to reopen them as it seems cost cutting is the ONLY priority since the merger  Had high hopes but I‚Äôm very disappointed
40,"After home confinement since March 2020 we decided on a Las Vegas trip staying at Caesar""s Palace.  On the whole a great change and pleasant except that you feel that the Vegas establishment is after you with a vengeance to part you with your money like a $26 hamburger and over $15 for bagel and a cup of coffee and with minimum $25/50 roulette tables and to add insult over injury no housekeeping. you call in for a set of towels to be bundled and left at your door. in spite of all this we encountered excellent interaction and friendliness from staff at all levels."
30,We had a room on the 12th floor of the Julius Tower overlooking the pools. Unpacked after arriving and noticed rug had seen better days since it was threadbare in spots and had many pulls. Bathroom floor tiles cracked and had dark stains. Room was well insulated against hearing door slams and the mattress gave us good night's sleep despite lousy pillows (all too soft). Most of the furniture was chipped in numerous places and lounger fabric was dark with wear. Room cleaning hasn't been done for a while: All high horizontal surfaces and baseboards were dusty. There was a bottle cap behind one night stand and a chocolate candy behind the dresser/mini bar. In fact we had no cleaning service done during the four nights we stayed and had to call in a request for towels. And speaking of the mini bar: if you jostled any item on top of the dresser it triggers an erroneous room charge for each incident so go over your bill thoroughly when checking out!
20,"I was giving the suggestion by the hotel operator to stay at another one of their properties for a better ""bang for my Buck"" - I will take his suggestion - I was disappointed with the room because I asked for a room similar to my stay two weeks prior and that's not what I got.. (Omar said it was similar and it was not)and I was charged an upgrade fee- (previous room had a sitting area..nice view and a bigger bathroom)I didn't like the short hours for the pool. (10-5pm ) The cost of the day bed was a little ridiculous for such a short amount of time....(if want to sit..you must buy a seat) The charge for drinks and the daybed leave less to be desired..(read the fine print when you book a daybed/cabana-alot of extra fees) The food options are limited for such a large Hotel /Casino and the options at the pool are even worse .. (Boxed sandwiches) Please eat before you go to the pool (maybe five items on the menu) IF i ever stay again.. I will stay at another location (planet hollywood was suggested)for what I paid for three days at this location.. I could have had a lot more- staff..more food options ..Sidenote: the check in for the daybed was a little disorganized and good seats are first come first serve....DIAGRAM on line on line shows an option to select and pay for the daybed but that's not the case.. (Bait&switch..deceitful) overall - spend your money elsewhere- I spent close to $1000 for 3 days and I would like to take it back.. but it was my birthday so I made the best of it."
50,Our room was located in the Augustus tower with the view of the Bellagio fountain it was beautiful. The room was really clean and the housekeeping lady was really nice. Location is plus!! You walk out of the Caesars and the main life of Vegas is right there.
50,Just returned last night from a 3nite stay. Upon checking asked Zorrex if it was possible to get a room with fountain view. We did. Room was very nice.  We ate dinner at the Bacchanal buffet. Food was very good. I especially enjoyed the crab legs.  We also ate lunch at the food court pizza and pronto by Giada.  Breakfast at Americana cafe. A little pricy but food always good.  Upon checking out Kristin was especially helpful and very pleasant.  Only disappointment was the fact that the only way to get to the pool was thru the Palace towers.  Hopefully they will change that soon.  Masks were worn by some but more not than with. I am fully vaccinated and felt comfortable without a mask.  I had some luck on the video poker machines in what I call the small casino.
50,Excellent service from Daniel at your front desk. Cordial nice and willing to help. Which these days is something you dont see or get. A great three days. David helped me get the kind of room I was hoping for and did it with a smile. R.A. Chavez / 5/21/2021 TO 5/24/2021
30,Affordable room rate. Check in was terrible very long lines. Room was excellent large and well equipped and very quiet. Small TV. Coffee not provided in room. Had a Keurig coffee box available for $22. Caesar's cafe ordinary breakfast was $70 for two. Good place to stay if you are not bothered by crowds high convenience costs and like to people watch.
10,If you don't use the valet parking you get penalized. It was a very very long walk from the car to registration through shops restaurants and casinos. The signage directing you to the registration is very poorly done. Had to ask security how to get there. At 4 p.m. the line to check-in is ridiculously long! There are only 6 kiosks for self check-in. The machines are a joke. We had to go up to the counter twice and were sent back to the kiosks with further info. Our room wasn't ready the 1st time my card couldn't be read. The agent was surly and short with us. It took over an hour to get through the registration process. Shame on you for not having it better thought out! Then another long walk to our elevator. Guess if you don't pay for the most expensive room you get shuttled to the back of the property. Our room was spacious and clean. We couldn't used the fridge because it is full of their expensive products. We got charged $19 even though we didn't remove anything from the honor bar. No one answered the phone after we finally got it to work. The check out line was long so I didn't get in it to dispute the charge. Pretty sure they do this on purpose. The restaurant was good but pricey. Room service rates were beyond stupid. $22 for pancakes? No thanks. Trying to get back to self-parking was another long long walk with a missed turned because of lack of signage. First time in Vegas and not going back. This place was an over priced joke!
40,Caesars was very nice but with buffet closed was hard to get something to eat without an hour wait not their fault COVID. Machines didn‚Äôt payout though so didn‚Äôt want to gamble to much there. Drink prices by the pull high and no snacks with only a few waitresses
30,Went to Vegas with family for three nights for our first trip and since Covid. ÔøºArrived at 1 PMÔøº and stood in line for an hour at the check-in desk only to be told that they had a strict $50 early check in fee before 4:00pm. If I agreed to pay the fee there was no guarantee if there‚Äôs a room availableÔøº. They told me to come back after 4 PM and stand in line again to get my keyÔøº.    Our room was clean when we arrived but housekeeping didn‚Äôt come either day. We Arrived back at the room each day at about 5 o‚Äôclock to freshen up only to find the room was the way it was when we left itÔøº. We had to call housekeeping each dayÔøº to bring us fresh towels and soap.    Tried to check out on the TV and my Caesars app and neither was working that morningÔøº. We had to go back down and stand in line for 30 minutes so we could check outÔøº.
20,I hate resort properties first they hit you with $45 resort fee. For what?? Internet?? Have more than 2 devices (who does not)-- add $14.99 per device. Suite gives no benefits.    We had an Octavius suite. Not bad. Furniture a little worn. But given a low floor and zero view.    Feel of hotel -- scuzzy patrons. Different from Bellagio or others. Nobody wearing a mask. Despite rule that only vaccinated can do so.    Not coming here again that's for sure!!
20,The service from the few ppl I dealt with at the desk was horrible. The room was not like what I seen online. The view was bad and even after I complained and stated how horrible I was treated I was offered a lousy food credit of $30. Ridiculous. For this to be one of the popular hotels you would think service would be better. I will be staying at a different hotel my next visit.
10,I‚Äôm deeply disappointed and honestly angry. I expected a lot better from this hotel. Our bathroom is filthy. Looks like the floor hasn‚Äôt been cleaned in god knows how long. The cabinets in this place look so old! They‚Äôre peeling super bad! All the glass has smudges and what looks like leftover toothpaste residue rolling down it. The shower is dirty too. The night stands in the room are covered with dust and finger prints. When we called guest services to complain they didn‚Äôt seem very concerned.    As if all that isn‚Äôt bad enough they have a mini fridge inside the rooms‚Ä¶except you can‚Äôt use it to put in any leftovers/your own food. They said if you open it and take out anything you will be charged 75 dollars. 75 dollars‚Ä¶not even to eat the stuff they have inside‚Ä¶ just to open it and put our own food in there.    I will never stay here again. And I‚Äôm going to tell everyone I know not to waste their money. This is pathetic. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre not even trying.
10,We were shopping at Caesar's Palace and followed the signs to a street level taxi/valet stand to catch a taxi back to our hotel. There were no taxi's and when I asked if the valet could call for a taxi to come around to pick us up he said no. He then told us to walk around to the front of the hotel to catch a taxi. So much for customer service.
20,We only stayed 2 nights but our room was never made up. When we called housekeeping they said they would send someone down. All they did was hand us new towels and bed sheets. We asked for a 30 minute late check out and they said it would be an additional $30.
50,I have stayed at many resorts and have received good service. However Tangela who works at the guest reservation is at Ceasar has exceeded my expectation. I can honestly say that she has been the bright spot of our vacation. I will return because of her service.
10,Room didnt look anything like online pictures..i was over charge..and paid more money that I was SUPPOSED TO PAY..SERVICE WAS BAD.i will never ever book another room there.i got charge for things we didnt even use.
40,My stay at the Caesars Palace was great with the exception of Elaina in the hotel‚Äôs check in area. Not only was she rude impatient and rolled her eyes but she blamed us for not knowing how to check in through the Kiask. Besides her everything was great at our stay!
30,I've been coming to Vegas 1 to 2xs a year since 1998. I have stayed at almost all the hotels but had never stayed at CP. Booked a Palace premium room. The room itself is nice but we were only on the 6th floor so had a view of the roof. The elevators to this tower get busy at the entrance as the pool entrance is near them. We never encountered busy elevators though so that was nice. Jetted tub in the bathroom didn't fully function. Not being able to use the fridge is inconvenient as well. Unless you want to pay $75. All in all it was an ok stay. I actually enjoyed the Paris or Planet Hollywood better. You get just as nice of a room and bathrooms with less walking to get to your room and you get a fridge. Cosmo is still the best place to stay but I can usually get comp'd rooms at Caesar's properties.
50,Caesars Palace customer service was amazing. We were unhappy with our room at the Palms and switched over to Caesars Palace. Upon check Tangela was amazing super friendly and helpful. Her attitude and customer service skills are impeccable. It was nice to be greeted by such a caring person. We also had the best bar tender ever. Donte service was unmatched. We can't wait to come back and visit again.
10,This was my very first trip to Las Vegas and I was very much looking forward to my stay at Caesar‚Äôs. After returning from a day of kayaking hungry and sun cooked I was extremely disappointed to wait a solid hour in their ‚Äúexpress‚Äù check-in line to receive my keys despite having already checked in online. Rather than allowing people to self-assort as is often the case at these sorts of kiosks guests were held behind a velvet rope and let in one at a time. Multiple kiosks were malfunctioning and a single attendant was responsible for both assisting customers and letting them through the line. This unbelievably inefficient setup resulted in only two or three kiosks being used at any given time. The ridiculous delay actually forced me to miss my lunch reservation. What should have taken one minute took a solid hour.    I had purchased late checkout when booking my room but apparently it didn‚Äôt take (it‚Äôs possible I made a mistake while booking but I was quite careful and particular so I don‚Äôt believe this was the case). After explaining the situation the front desk still attempted to charge me extra for a late checkout and were wholly unwilling to work with me despite my poor experiences the day before. The room was beautiful but I will not be staying here again.    Customer service goes a long way and lack thereof can lose a potential lifelong customer. I have never before written a negative review online but leaving such a sour taste in my mouth at the end of my first Vegas vacation has left me profoundly disappointed. If you end up staying here I hope you have a better experience than I did.
50,Absolutely gorgeous hotel. They upgraded our room for free do to unavailability of the room we reserved. Cleanliness is so important to us and it did not fall short in that area or any other. Needless to say...very pleased üòÄ
40,I was accused of using counterfeit $100 from Starbucks inside Caesars after a giant production and embarrassment they came to the conclusion it was real and was told ‚Äúwe‚Äôre very sorry‚Äù suck it Caesars
30,First off I feel for the service staff as they are short handed & bust tail to do the best they can. Cabana...waste of money! Limited food service & if you want more than prepackaged foods you have to go to the food court & get it. Had to spend almost 1hr waiting on food as we paid over $1000 to enjoy a cabana. Seriously just don‚Äôt open cabanas until you can do it right.
30,We came in on Saturday night what a zoo. Room was over booked given another tower. Not happy next day original tower but down grade in room ugh. Drank a water to take morning pill. ugh 9.75 charge crazy. extra charges on bill. But called and removed. So POOL area beautiful and relaxing. Great vibe. On Sunday night I was robbed of my stack of 25.00 chips only 3. But yikes. They were recovered and man was sent to jail and thrown out. Ugh. After all that NO COMP ??? Weird way to treat a customer. No nothing. Vegas is fun. Show was was gorgeous Absinthe. We LOVED IT !! But not so good other issues. As far as restaurant Homestead Steakhouse very nice food and dinner. Waters grill beautiful lunch in entrance of Forum shops. But totally packed.I will return to Vegas but different hotel. I wanted a seamless stay without other crap.I did enjoy the weather and location.
10,"Our experience was so horrific it's unbelievable. I double dog dare an executive or officer of Caesars entertainment to contact me .regarding the matter. First room was filthy. Second room was next to a psychopath throwing tantrums and screaming and cussing all night. We were terrified. Security came twice. A manager that said he was sending help to move us to a third room as I have cancer and my mom is in a wheelchair. We vacated the room when the man started crying and pounding on wall that separate our rooms and crying out ""why are you ""F"" ing with me nobody ""f""s with me. I made it down to the casino/guest services floor with my mom and luggage. I went to manager again who said he would send someone to get us and help us. We sat in hall next to elevators for 40 minutes and noone came. We then realized nobody was coming so we lugged our way and asked for the manager AGAIN. This time a woman came out and informed us the manager that promised to call us when room was ready and left us sitting terrified at bottom of elevators had gone home for the day. This managerMaria. gave us keys to room and got bellman to help us. This experience was straight out of a horror movie not to mention an abuse of two women with disabilities. Shame on Caesar's Palace."
30,"This was not a very impressive property - at all. There is a ""resort"" fee but nothing indicative of a ""resort"". Couldn't even get into ANY of the pools even though most COVID restrictions have lifted. Trying to get extra towels (only 2 were initially provided) was like pulling teeth. There is a fridge in the room which is nice but it's already stocked and there is no room for anything but what they stock it with. Overall the room was run down (carpet was ripped and not very clean) BUT - the bed was pretty awesome and the AC works REALLY well. Still - we would've chosen a different hotel this was our first visit to Vegas so now we know :)"
50,Great experience at check in Zandra really made us feel welcome and was able to assist with all of our check in needs.  Entire stay was wonderful rooms were clean and functional will return to stay at Caesars.
40,I stayed in the Palace Tower 1403. The room was clean and nice sized üëç. The view was of a parking lot üëé. Caesars is pretty much back to pre-Covid 19 normal. Courtesy bottles of water (in the room) and more breakfast food options (in the hotel) would certainly enhance my experience.
40,Rooms: modern spacious and clean. All of them are located in separate from casino towers that‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt hear any loud noise. Good soundproof on the floor. There is mini bar in every room.  Location: very convenient. The hotel is located in the center of Las Vegas Strip. There are grocery stores walkways nearby.  Parking: complementary parking for guests. If you are checking in after self-parking in Caesar‚Äôs garage be ready go to the reception through all casino area.  Restaurants: There are a lot of prestigious restaurants inside the hotel (Nobu The Hell‚Äôs Kitchen). A lot of restaurants are around the hotel.  Casino: Big casino zone is located in the 1st floor. A lot of different slot machines roulettes with different bets ($15 min) blackjack and poker zones - you can find everything you want.  Staff: friendly and polite.
40,Great hotel with nice staff great taxi service and lots of restaurants. If you are planning to dine at nice restaurants please make reservations ahead of time. If you like to be where the action is this is the place to stay.
40,The hotel is gorgeous but the check in lines are horrible with only 2 to 3 clerks. The pool closes at 5:00 I think the time need to be extended. The Ceaser rewards desk was always busy with only 2 clerks to serve you. This hotel is extremely large and need more staff on duty.
50,This hotel and staff were wonderful. Our room was clean and always tidy. Our view of all of the pools was exceptional. We had one very bad experience with a bar tender but with that being said one bad apple doesn't change our feeling of a great trip...than you Ceasars!!!
20,Our first two nights at Caesars Palace were sleepless due to the room 4 doors playing loud thumping music all night. Then to get an elevator you had to wait 20 to 30 minutes at a time entire stay!!!!
20,We stay in Vegas 3x/year... we booked at Caesar‚Äôs thinking we‚Äôd have a fantastic experience. It couldn‚Äôt have been further from the truth. When checking in they gave us a king room instead of the double queen we booked (as a joint room with our suite booking). As a Diamond member we thought checking in would be easy. However they messed up our rates along with our rooms and it ended up taking 45 minutes to sort it out. Housekeeping never came and when we called for more towels it took 2+ hours to get them. On our third day there was no water in our suite or conjoining room... when we complained to the front desk they gave us a $100 credit and told us ‚Äúsomeone would be up soon‚Äù. There were 6 elevators to our tower and only 1-2 were working throughout our stay. Safe to say we will NEVER stay here again.
50,Caesars Palace is definitely the place to visit. I received a complimentary upgrade to a suite because it was an issue with my room. I got locked out my room one night and I thought I had to walk back to the front desk. I was angry but security came and let me in. Their customer service is outstanding and they truly go over and beyond. I definitely will be returning in the future.
20,Where do I start? First night asked for extra towels took 8 hrs and me going downstairs to front desk to be acknowledged. Next day never had my room cleaned. Guess if you book with a 3rd party the hotel treats you less than. After 4 yrs not in Vegas and a hundred hotels to choose from this was a Mistake. Said I was getting a pool view ended up getting a view of a roof with ac units and vents on it. hardly a pool view. Had a better view at planet Hollywood pool. And the shower that was remodeled In my room poor job with the tiles. Jagged edges will Cut your feet. Overall totally Dissatisfied! Never Returning
30,I reserved a suite for my stay. Added notes I wanted a connecting room. Called to reserve a connected room. We arrive no connecting room. 30 mins to sort out after a 4 hr delayed flight. Is this still Caesars or is this still Caesars???? On top of it toilet was leaky. Smh...
50,I would highly recommend Caesars Palace. The details and all the statue around the property were amazing. The pool was nice. A little pricey but always something to do. The mall and all the restaurants were great.
50,My boyfriend and I stayed at Caesars LV in May 2021. Eric in VIP check-in was extremely helpful & resourceful for our stay. We ran into an issue that was out of our hands but Eric helped us get it all taken care of! We were super thankful for him.
50,We had a fun 4 night stay at Caesars. We were upgraded to the Octavius Tower and the room was first rate. Beautiful bathroom and lots of space. Only problem was we couldn‚Äôt get Jacuzzi tub jets to work. Not a big deal. The Caesars complex is huge and my wife complained about the amount of walking required to get around. We reserved chairs at the Venus pool and it was really worth it. Guaranteed chairs for the whole day and fantastic service at an adult only pool. Staff was friendly and property was beautifully maintained. Casino was fun with mostly personable dealers and fun seeking clientele.
40,Recently stayed at Cesar‚Äôs for 5 nights. We were in the Palace Towers in a Premium room with 1 King bed. There were a few notable upgrades & conveniences in the hotel room. The bathroom has been redone at some point there is beautiful tile throughout sunk in bath tub private shower area with great water pressure double vanity sinks and separate area for toilet with a door. Right outside the bathroom in the hallway was a vanity area with nice lighting and makeup mirror. Plenty of closet and storage space throughout the room. The bed was super plush and comfortable.  The walls of the hotel room are thin occupants on one side of us were loud and kept us up at night. Housekeeping was hit or miss over 6 days we had housekeeping come to our room twice one of the times was per request.  The overall cleanliness of the room was good but it appeared that the room hadn‚Äôt been deep cleaned in a while there were water spots on the bathroom floor dust on the shelves furniture & carpet is somewhat worn. The bathroom was definitely the nicest part of the room.  The hotel complex itself is enormous it does take a while to get in and out of the hotel. We were visiting during a time when the hotel seemed particularly busy so there were lots of people everywhere lots of partying.  We visited one pool I don‚Äôt remember which one it‚Äôs the pool closest to the Palace Towers it was a nice pool the water was ice cold though.  My overall impression of our stay was ‚Äúgood‚Äù for some reason I anticipated great and beyond. Cesar‚Äôs is an iconic hotel my husband and I always said we‚Äôd like to stay at. Back in the 80‚Äôs & 90‚Äôs Cesar‚Äôs was so glamorous maybe my initial impression of the property is what I still expected 20 + years later.  The Forum Shoppes are still beautifully maintained and there are many restaurants throughout the property. I‚Äôm glad we stayed at Cesar‚Äôs to try it out but I don‚Äôt think we will choose to stay there again.
50,First when I arrived I forgot my phone in the Taxi ... when I told the valet he sprang into ACTIOBN (his name was Eric) and called the Taxi Service on my receipt and chased down the driver ... the driver returned in 20 mins with my phone!    Next I went to check in and the Kiosks were not working properly so a gentleman named Jean came to assist me ... Jean was super nice and even upgraded my room to put me at ease and calm everything down.    Overall it was a great experience ... I would book again in a heartbeat 5 Stars!!!
40,Room was very nice great casino great location. Food was very overpriced. We ate breakfast  at the Americano Cafe...not a fancy place but the food prices were outrageous. $8 for a tiny glass of orange juice $8 for toast ! The other places available for breakfast items were very expensive as well.
30,Hidden fees are ridiculous we got there and paid the resort fee then on top of that was told we had to pay $100 a night for damage waiver..what if we was on a budget and didn‚Äôt have that! They need to put it on there site!! Couldn‚Äôt use the refrigerator. We was there 4 nights and had to buy a cooler for our drinks!! After spending that kind of money we was highly piss!
10,Caesars is a beautiful hotel. The decor is on point and it has plenty of shops and restaurants. However I‚Äôm so frustrated with it.    The most frustrating thing was that I had one debit card that disappeared from my room and was charged $50. Luckily it was a card that I leave almost no money in it but still mind-blowing.    The Forum Tower needs A LOT of renovations. During my stay every single day there was a broken elevator. The ones that weren‚Äôt broken were nasty and it felt like they were about to die at any time.    The classic suite was so disappointing: it had a nasty old carpet full of permanent stains on the doors and the bathroom floor loud AC. Also when we first opened the door the room was stinking like marijuana like as just someone just burned a whole blunt inside of the room. That smell was in the room during the 5 days I stayed there.    The bathroom was nice. I loved the jacuzzi but they give you the cheapest toilet paper you can find. It‚Äôs like wiping with notebook paper.    Checking in was also a hustle. There is no online check-in unless you‚Äôre a Caesars Diamond or something like that so the line was huge and we waited for a good half-hour in line to check-in.    The pools were okay. They look way bigger from pictures so expect to spend some time looking for a chair to sit on. The prices of the drinks at the pool bar are ridiculous. I don‚Äôt mind spending a lot of money on my travels as long as I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm being ripped off but $20 for a frozen drink is ridiculous. Plus they close the pools at 5pm so it is hot out and sunny until 8pm but they close their pools at 5pm. It makes no sense.    The gym was also okay. It isn‚Äôt too big considering the size of the hotel but it has decent equipment. There are no free weights though.    Overall my stay at Caesars was terrible. First time I had something stolen from my hotel bedroom. Be careful with what you leave in your room when staying there.
40,The room was fantastic lots of room second bathroom and very clean! Was not happy with all of the additional charges ( only two devices per room on wi-fi extra charge for coffee even though there was Keurig Machine in room & additional charge for putting personal items in mini fridge). As expensive as the rooms are at Caesar‚Äôs Palace these items should be included.
20,Arrived on 5/16 and stayed until 5/19. Line was extremely long to check in. The person was very nice once we made it to the counter. My room was very dusty from the coffee maker to the table to me being able to write my name on the TV stand. I was a little upset that they didn't have a refrigerator for person use or microwave. To make matters worse they ran out of drinks on my room floor so I went to the floor just below only to go inside and fall because it was a lot of water on the floor. I was helped up and taken in the hallway where there's a phone. Took so long to get someone to answer. Finally talked to security who said someone would be coming up. 10 minutes later my leg is getting more sore. We call security desk again and talk to s I someone else and said I would be going to my room. I was already embarrassed that my clothes were wet and assumed people might have thought I used the bathroom on myself. About 10 minutes of being in my room someone comes. He said he is dual or duo which means he does both security and injuries. He took my statement and I had to also write it out. I was asked did I need to go to the hospital I said I didn't but was some ice or pad for the pain. He said they didn't have ice packs anymore. He said once he went downstairs to view the area he would get some ice out of the machine and put it in a garbage bag to give to me. Twenty minutes later he comes up and said it was a lot of water and that he had to stay there until someone came up. When security was first called they said they were sending someone there but he had to call to ask them to send someone. They lied and never requested for anyone to check on what I had reported which means someone else could've been injured. We both signed the report. Pictures were taken. Never received a visit or call from a manager with an apology. Couldn't enjoy my time there with a sore leg.
10,I was informed by Valet it was $35.00 to use valet for a 24 hour period. Since I was checking in & had a good amount of bags use valet so I could use the bell desk to help with my bags. We added an extra day to our trip at front desk & got our room keys. We went to our room called the bell desk as we were instructed after 3 calls with no answer and an hour later because your just on hold the whole time then eventually you are hung up on we decided to walk to the bell desk. The bell desk said it was going to take 1 hour to get my bags that's fine. The bellman who brought my luggage to my room was VERY nice he got a tip from me & I tipped the bellman who help get the bags out of my car. Next day I go to get my car at valet and I was told I owe $5 dollars I explained I already paid $35.00 he said oh on the weekend it's $40.00 I told him I was informed at the 1st valet person it was $35.00 and the kiosk should know it's Sunday why didn't it charge me $40.00. Nothing he doesn't care I have to pay the extra $5.00 fine whatever I'm on vacation I'm not going to be in a bad mood. Walked around on the strip came back to our room at 9:00 pm no maid service she gave us plastic cups that we had asked for the day before but she didn't make up our room. We had put all the towels in the middle of the bathroom so they could be scooped up everything was how we left it. Called front desk explained that our room was not made up and the sink from his morning was clogged. She sent a person to our room and he gave me bags so I could place the trash in & another bag for the towels then at 2:30 am the room across the hall decided to have a party had to call front desk to have security ask them to close their door while they had 10 people in their room throwing a rave. Maintenance came & fixed my sink and we headed to self parking because that is where we parked so we didn't pay another $35 dollars and everyone told us it was free -- well it wasn't. I spent another $40.00 in parking fees because the kiosk has steps - step ONE put your parking ticket it in - Step 2 put your credit card in - Step 3 use your Reward Card - Step 4 use your room key - after step 2 it takes your money how can get to step 4. There is not a huge sign that says if your a guest insert your parking ticket then hold up your room key which should be step 2. We tried everything using my local Id and using the room key and it was say invalid credentials. Front desk would not reimburse me the parking fees.
10,"At Check In we ""upgraded"" for an additional fee to a premium hot tub room only to find pubes in the tub makeup smears on the counters and hair all over the couch. After 3 calls to front desk and 1 visit in person to the manager we were told housekeeping would be up to fix issues. We came back to our room to find our bed made and STILL all the hair and dirtiness in the room. At checkout we were still charged the ""upgrade"" fee.    We stayed at Caesar's palace expecting Filet Mignon and instead got McDonalds."
50,"Caesars Palace is definitely the top hotel recommendation for a first-time visitor to Vegas. First of all it has everything; plenty of nice rooms at fair prices an efficient check-in system amazing restaurants throughout top notch shopping a great pool complex 5-star spa and salon night club shows wedding options casinos and most importantly it is right in the middle of everything you want to experience being located right next to the Bellagio and right across from the Linq. Our only complaint was that there was no room-service even though we were asked at check-in if we wanted it and said ""yes""."
40,We stayed here to see their wedding venue which is amazing! The casino was great and loved the food options and shopping. The grounds are breathtaking! The room was just average. It was clean but the furniture was all scratched up. TV in the bathroom mirror was great. Will stay again when we get married here. Employees were wonderful! Drinks are $24 each and that was everywhere! Location is great! Less homeless people and people smoking pot on the strip on this side of the strip.
10,Half the amenities in our room didn't work. They changed our rooms and lied about the upgrade charge. When I asked for a Supervisor they were too busy to bother. I have traveled and stayed at over a dozen places in LV and this is the worst experience I have ever had.
10,Everything was great except people upstairs were partying all night! Who let them to do so I don‚Äôt know. There are plenty places to party but not in the room! Concierge is not working so had to call police at 3am still no help. They finished party at 5am and finally we could sleep. This is terrible!!! I missed breakfast and pool. By the time I could get up at 9am everywhere were big lines for 1-2 hour waiting time!! Hotel returned my 51$ fee for this inconvenience but it‚Äôs not worth my time and nerves. Will not come back again.
10,Our stay was horrible. We had to change rooms 3 times with little to no apology for their mistake. Then the hotel was booked solid but amenities were still at limited capacity which caused lines everywhere including the pool which was the primary reason for us to stay there. It was horrible. Don't ever book with them. I will never stay there again.
10,This was by far the worst Vegas vacation we‚Äôve ever had. Where do I begin we have reserved a supposedly two bedroom suite only to find out that it was an actual one bedroom suite with an attached room but when we checked in the chest room was not ready so our family had to wait an extra two hours for their room. Second in our room their was blood on one door the door to the bathroom would barley open and not to mention the view or lack of a view was laughable why even have a window if it just looks at a wall. To top it offthere is only one working elevator and the entire form tower weight of almost 15 to 20 minutes just use the elevator. And finally if that wasn‚Äôt enough we never felt safe walking through the casino with some multiple homeless drug attic‚Äòs walking through the lobby asking us for money and not one sign of security around at all. This will definitely be our last trip we didn‚Äôt feel like we were on the strip the more so that we were down in Fremont Street. Caesars palace is no longer one of the elite casinos on the strip for what we received do you have thought we had a discounted $59 a night rate of what we paid for and what we got not even close to worth it
40,"I live only miles from ""the strip"" and have alot of choices when I decide I need a break! I tried Caesars while back when things first opened back up and was less than impressed. My wife and I stayed there this last weekend and DEFINATELY on its way back. It still a work in progress. The room in the Octavius Tower was impressive....huge soaking tub and wonderful view of the pool. The TRICK with the pool is to ""follow their rules"" (which I'm not always good at) text for the check in and its really pretty quick to get entry. The food everywhere is pricy but a few new outlets to ease the pain there Cheesecake Factory in the mall nearby is a good option.. The cellular service (Verizon) is bad inside the hotel room but WIFI worked well. OVERALL definite B+ and rising... Truly a top 4 in Vegas!"
50,This was my first stay at Las Vegas and the room was AMAZING everything was super clean. The service was amazing and the room features and room view are incredible I will definitely stay again in this amazing hotel.
10,Great location on the strip unfortunately they didn't utilize the shutdown time to make repairs to the hotel. Most elevators were broken rooms were outdated pool access was limited Wi-Fi didn't work and staff were uncooperative.
50,Love this hotel and can‚Äôt wait to come back. Dealers are quite nice and helpful with the games. Our room is nice and comfortable and room services arrived in good timing and best are the shops are to die for. Prepare to spend when you there but all worth the trip!
30,"A very disappointing stay. Wifi was interment Rewards card issued did not work thru evening hours - ""machine making them was broken ck with Guest Rewards when they open at 10A"". 5 star hotel with spa like qualities in room did not provide robes had issues with tub draining. Quick fix by maintenance only lasted one use. The next use drain control knob fell off in hand. Mini-frig locked despite $100 deposit paid in advance for three nite stay. Was unable to be unlocked until the following business day . . . No pricing sheet on items in frig. No Hotel Guest information book in room. Ice machine locations? Check out times? Asked for a room near elevator - recvd room 3/4 way down hallway. Nice view clean room but lacking quality one would expect at an historic upscale hotel."
50,I planned a Mother‚Äôs Day getaway for my 77-year-old mother as she has not been to Las Vegas in over 50 years. I did my research booked an accessible room through Caesar‚Äòs website and looked forward to our trip. Upon checking in (5/7/21) we were given a room different than the one we had booked which happened to be much smaller older and with no view at all. (Thank you Emma who also knew about my mother)  I went downstairs knowing that they had already given my reserved room away and had placed us into another hoping for something comparable to the original booking.  We were greeted by Daniel who realized right when he saw my original reservation what I needed. He quickly found a solution he assured me my worries were over. They were. He went above and beyond to give us a beautiful room (accessible) overlooking the strip. It was stunning.  I cannot say enough about the level of customer service that he provided.  We spent a lot of time and energy to bring a wheelchair-bound 77-year-old woman to Las Vegas just to show her a couple of days of fun and he realized that and really worked hard to make sure it happened.  Thank you Daniel. Thank you.  My mother loved the view and had all the luck on the casino floor.
50,Hotel is very nice seems to be in the middle of everything I only had these issues my pillows smelled really bad couldn‚Äôt use them also paint is chipping in bathroom didn‚Äôt affect anything just an eyesore
10,"What can I say but Cesar is dead in this case by the clueless management staff. Can't really blame the non existent house keeping staff cocktail servers wait staff etc. Customer service lip service. The hotel services folks answering the phones offer zero help saying ""housekeeping is extremely backup"" and ""don't know when they can get to you"". That or ""that restaurant is not managed by Cesars"" excuse. House keeping didn't come at all the first day and now it is day 2 1500 hrs and no ETA. They did drop off fresh bath towels at 1730 last night though after a second phone call. The staff in general is indifferent appear overwhelmed and apathic. Of course the prices (outrageous by even by their staffs opinion). That and most everything is not price marked and ""dynamic"" according to the staff at the various shops. The ""covid-19"" card is on full display charging high prices for non existent customer service. Total fail never again!"
30,"First time at Caesars and I wasn't all that impressed. I supposed they're short-handed but texting a bot for concierge services is disappointing to say the least. The pool situation was ridiculous which I guess can also be blamed on covid? Though the behavior of the employees guarding the pool entrance cannot be. The lack of personnel in the Hotel is my main complaint there was never anyone around to ask a question of... for anything? We had a Palace studio room which was fine but also unimpressive for a ""Vegas room."" It was large but not well-lit which in turn made it feel small. The bed was comfortable but the shower didn't drain properly so you had to turn the water off let it drain and then turn the water back on. Ugh. The dual-bath/shower room is overrated imo I'd rather that space be in the room itself. We did appreciate the center strip location of Caesars but I'm not sure I'd stay here again with so many other choices in the same area. Rating: Meh"
10,"During our stay at Caesars Palace we experienced several issues that travelers must be aware of that the hotel will not inform you of.    We booked two rooms in the Forum Tower on May 10th 2021. On the first night one of our rooms had a broken toilet that would not flush and appeared to have feces coming up from the pipes. The shower knob was sealed shut not allowing the water temperature to be adjusted the room phone was broken and the bed was extremely worn. I went to the front desk to inform them of the issue and I was moved to another room down the hallway near our second room. The room we moved to and our other room both had broken phones and we were waken at 7:30am all three days to the sound of construction in the hallways directly outside our room doors. there was plastic on the hallway floors and several workers were painting the hallway and upgrading other rooms in the hallway. It's also important to note that this building has 6 elevator and three of them were out of service our entire stay making it difficult to get up and down from our room in a timely manner. I'm puzzled as to why the hotel would allow customer to stay in this area of construction and dis-repair. Clearly they are not concerned with the overall satisfaction of guests as this floor should not be used during their upgrade. For years Caesars Palace was the top resort in town and very clean... Not anymore. You can get a better RESORT at the local motels. I would also caution readers from leaving the hotel after 11:00pm as all exits are over taken by homeless panhandling. I walked outside the front entrance near the valet and was greeted by several individuals doing drugs. The valet employees and security seemed very friendly with this activity. When I brought my experience to the management attention they removed 2 days of resort fees. I asked that they all be removed due to our experience and was told they will not give further compensation because ""they have done enough for me"". Clearly they should not charge any RESORT fees as this place is anything but a RESORT. It seems like a large motel under construction with broken elevators. BEWARE OF THESE ISSUES WHEN CHOOSING YOUR NEXT HOTEL TO STAY AT IN LAS VEGAS!!"
10,"10 for craps crew; -9 for terrible food and beverage service. I came as an invited ""comp guest"" for three nights. Impossible to find any place for one person to get a burger slice or noodle bowl without 30-minute delay; Caesar's Rewards up malfunctions with iPhone 8 so can't order for pickup and delivery and restaurant s don't take calls; last night from 0200-0300 there were ZERO cocktail waitresses serving ANYWHERE in the casino and at 0200 one pleasant but overworked waitress for entire casino; casino hosts won't accept phone calls concierge no help but said she'd transfer me front desk currently slammed by check ins. Great dice crew but I'm back to Bellagio. I hate this as I have 35 years of great memories at Caesar's including Ali v Foreman fight. Maybe gamble here but stay somewhere else that cares more for guest basic needs and the well being of line workers. PS I never did get the $15 burger I was looking for but a very nice hostess at Nobu moved some barstools around and I had a nice $87 meal."
30,The hotel doesn‚Äôt seem to believe in microwave at all. The rooms don‚Äôt have any and neither does the food service at the pool which served us cold nasty sandwiches (for $15 each) . The hotel is super huge with shops food and a bunch of casino area but to be honest it‚Äôs just the name that‚Äôs you‚Äôre paying for. There‚Äôs a bunch of other interesting hotels on the strip.
10,The service was horrible. We had to wait for everything including the pool. 1-2hr wait for food. Didn't get our room cleaned one night and was over billed us for hotel fees. Poor signage throughout the facility made it difficult to find things. People were asking where do i go for whatever. Never will stay again. Food and Alcohol was over priced! never got one free drink and I spent over $500 dollars in gambling.
30,My wife and I have been coming to Las Vegas for many years and this was our first stay at Caesar's Palace. The staff was great and the room was fantastic but the pot smoking throughout the hallways and different sections of the casino and outside the entrances was unbearable. There is an ordinance that makes this illegal but the security seem to look the other way they need to clean up their act if they want people to continue coming there and not just the potheads
50,During this troubled time when everyone seems so stressed out it was a breath of fresh air to be treated so kindly at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas and to be given true personal attention. Especially since personal attention seems to be nonexistent any more. That's why when Nayeli at the check in desk at Caesars when she went way out of her way to make our experience at Caesars a memorial one without me asking it meant so much. She had an hour left to her day and you could tell it may have been a rough day at work. I can't imagine how hard it must be to work with the public during this strange time. But that didn't faze Nayeli. We got there early then I asked about checking in early and she seemed so happy for us that we were on our second honeymoon and we ended up upgrading our room and it was a great deal! She said she would call my cell phone when the room was ready and of course she did exactly that. And then we went up to our room and we just couldn't believe it! We were able to check in early and she got us such a beautiful room - we can see the Bellagio Fountains right from our window. It's people like Nayeli that make a real much-needed positive difference in the world. My husband and I are having the best experience here at Caesars Palace and we owe a large part of that to Nayeli. Thank you so much for all of your hard work and fighting for us to get us that deal and especially for your kind and caring attention! We won't forget it. üòä‚ù§
50,Mr. Delano was very accommodating. Once we got there he welcomed us and not just by the script. He was very genuine and actually happy to help us out. He gave us great service and will be happy to come again soon!
10,Stayed for 3 nights everything was fine I was excited to stay at a decent rate until I got charged a $75 mini bar fridge restocking and weight balance fee for opening the door. There was no tape on the door thus just out of curiosity I wanted to see what was inside the fridge. We didn't use any items from the mini bar during our whole stay. I called the front desk during checkout to dispute the fee they said they would send up a mini bar attendant to check the fridge. After waiting a hour they were never sent. I called again and they said a manager would call me around 3pm. No one ever called me. After the weekend passed I called Caesars billing department and they said they can't take off the charge. Because of this I will NOT stay at this property ever again. It will be my first and last visit. Horrible customer service.
30,Staff very inconsistent. Some were courteous and professional and others were opposite. You could not really tell who would help you with kindness. Did not get the room that I reserved and paid for according to the website. That changed everything for our wedding party.
50,Wonderful trip. Great stay at this property. Debub was the person who checked me in. She was polite professional and very helpful. We had a great time gambling and strolling through this massive property. They have everything you would ever need. The best shopping and restaurants. We had a great stay.
30,Complaints:  - slow internet. I've been traveling in the past few months this is the hotel with the highest star level and definitely slowest internet  - dark room. The main room area is dark no ceiling light a few table lamps and requires Tobe turned on individually. After all turned on still dark. I'm on a work-from-hotel trip and this just doesn't work well  - 2 Keurig coffee pods for $30!!! What a rip off
10,This property has awful customer service. Either unresponsive or very long waits on hold. One of the worst in terms of trying to speak to someone by phone. Unresponsive to website complaint This is a casino and not a hotel in terms of hospitality unless you have lots of play.
10,The hotel is pretty but I would not stay again and I'd recommend other places for a better value. I'm disappointed. The check-in time is 4pm but they still definitely charge you for the full day of resort fee. Also I checked in early online via the email they sent but we still had to wait 1.5 hours in a line of hundreds of people to get the room keys? The front desk was so poorly staffed and supposedly this is only at 50% capacity. There are several pools but I never saw the warning online that you can only use 1 or have to pay $250 daybed rental to use the rest of them. Pool was packed with no chairs by 10am. Also for this price point there is a keurig machine in the room but you have to pay for the pods! I think this hotel would be even worse once it's at full capacity. I spent a lot of money here and didn't enjoy anything about it.
50,We enjoyed being able to have access to so many activities. All kinds of shopping.The food was good. My husband enjoyed playing in poker tournament. I played slots & they are you everywhere!!!. We had a good time.
10,Do you want a water? Try 8oz for $4.25. Want to play craps? Try $25 dollar minimums with dealers that couldn‚Äôt care less who you are or how much money you have spent. (Didn‚Äôt scan my players card for 35 minutes). You play machines? Please try getting a drink. It took me four and a half hours to get my first. Caesar‚Äôs has simply been allowed to exist for many years and that‚Äôs our fault. It is ‚Äúcool looking‚Äù but does not deserve to be the considered the ‚Äúbest‚Äù casino in Las Vegas. They stopped caring and so should you. Trash. Absolute trash.
10,Me and my husband stayed 4days 3 nights.. we got woken up every day at 6am by our next door neighbors. It was so frustrating that we even called hotel security. not to be able to sleep the whole night was horrible. There was stained blood on the sheets unfortunately we did not see this until we checked out. Very disappointed in my stay. Figured it being a huge hotel that they would pay more attention to the cleanliness and had better quality sound proof room. But you could hear everything from the hall as well.
50,We needed to change rooms and spoke with two other staff members. We felt brushed off until we walked downstairs and met with Bryan. Bryan was patient understanding and extremely helpful. He resolved our issue within 10 minutes with the best attitude. Customer Service at it's finest. I would recommend this hotel to anyone if all staff service is close to Bryan's.
20,Honestly I felt that the entire experience at Ceasars was an exercise in bad faith business practices. My room rate was high. For that rate I received nothing but a bed to sleep in and a television to watch. I was nickel and dimed at every turn at an exorbitant cost. Low budget hotels in the middle of nowhere offer their guests coffee self service in their rooms. Ceasars on the other hand wanted 20 dollars to access coffee in room. Budget hotels along interstates offer something of a breakfast at no cost to guests. Not Ceasars. For two days I was denied pool access because non guests were paying for cabanas. On top of it all... I was charged a 50 dollars per night resort fee for services I did not utilize. In short... when I left Ceasars I felt wrung out and unsatisfied. Shan't return... ever. Disproportionate ratio of cost to return.
20,Booked on a promo rate that seemed too good to be true. Apparently everyone else got this rate as the hotel was packed with low-rent clients rude and loud guests and over-extended service.  Room didn't get a visit from housekeeping. Called and requested attention and was ignored as we used the same towels for 3 days.  Bathrooms were atrocious and the pricing at restaurants was inconceivable.    You can book a better experience elsewhere.
10,I cant think of one good thing that happened during our stay. The staff were ALL rude with the exception of in Americana Rest. No amenities in the rooms Keurig but no coffee everything way over priced.  Couldn't get into the Pool even though had to pay Resort Fees every day! My Check Out experience was deplorable. The person helping me was awful! Never will I return!
10,When my husband and I booked our room with Caesar‚Äôs Palace we were so excited! We were looking forward to a high quality room in one of the fanciest hotels on the Las Vegas strip. We booked a deluxe king bedroom. When we got in the room  There was a red beverage stain on the nightstand as well as smudges on the couch. The room was extremely small. We also had NO refrigerator in the room.    After making the front desk aware of the issues in our room. We decided to upgrade at an additional cost to US! Another $30+ per night. They also double charged our account for our safety deposit and resort fee so at one point their was over $1000.00 taken out of our account on a trip we had already paid everything but the resort fee on! We did get the rest refunded ($ was back in our acct by day 4) but we had to make a money transfer to cover it which I know some  people may not have the financial means to handle. After all this the hotel management only approved a $35 meal compensation credit that couldn‚Äôt even be used in all the restaurants in the hotel!    After we got to the second (supposedly recently renovated) room it was definitely nicer than the first but that‚Äôs not a high standard to beat... the bathroom had brown smudges on parts of the walls there were smudges all over our window to the strip air vents were caked in a THICK layer of dust and there was a hair from someone other then my husband or myself in the bedding. We just ended up calling for a bedspread change and I walked to CVS got Clorox wipes and I CLEANED MY OWN ROOM ON MY VACATION!    Also this hotel is so big... you spend most of your time just navigating your way back to your hotel room. It‚Äôs easy to get lost. I wish I could say our hotel stay was amazing... However it was anything but.
10,This is the WORST place to stay in Vegas. Few things that happened. I stayed at The Cosmo Park MGM and Bellagio before this week just seeing which I liked the most for next time. This was by FAR the worst. The customer service the casino staff and the hotel itself.    1 It took 2 hours before my toom was ready and my check in was at 4 and didn‚Äôt get in until 630.  2 the room key they provided broke 3 different times. I left for dinner came back to get cash and it didn‚Äôt work. Had to go to the front desk. Then left to gamble came back and what do you know broken. Then left for a show and what do you know broken.  3 When I went back the 3rd time I ask for a manager and guess what. They made me wait for another 40 mins to get one...  4 The room was in the Forum tower which getting there is crazy compared to others as well as their parking. Very confusing layout compared. You have to walk about 10 mins to the front desk.    I would rather pay more for less then ever give them my money again.
40,"Walked in the door on ""Cinco de Mayo"" ordered a traditional Margarita for the occasion at the Casino bar and have to say I was shocked at the cost of the drinks. Ordered 3 drinks and was charged $57. not including gratuity. In other words a $100 bill won't even buy two rounds of drinks for three persons. The same was true at the Pool Bar are outside. A Mai Tai cost me $38.00 + tip for one drink. I'm sorry but even in todays world that's out of control pricing. I'm sure they're not the only Casino's doing the same thing and although I'm not cheap nor poor I'll likely go to other places than Caesars and perhaps Las Vegas in general in the future."
30,I've stayed at many different hotels in Las Vegas but not Ceasar's so I booked in for 3 days. The hotel property itself is beautiful. The pools are gorgeous and the water is warm. They have a lot of very high end shops. The hotel says it's 5 star but the Forum Tower where I stayed is definitely 2-3 star. The furniture was probably quite hip in the 70s but hasn't been changed since. It needed a coat of paint. The chair and dresser have probably been there since the 70s the walls were scuffed. The last day I was there the toilet wouldn't flush. The bed was comfortable however. While the room wasn't expensive there were many other options in Vegas that were cheaper and of the same quality. They provide a coffee machine but no coffee (you have to buy it from the mini bar) I think this is the first hotel in the US I've stayed at that didn't give you coffee. I bought a Cappuccino in the cafe for $9 each morning. With all the options in Vegas I won't stay at Ceasar's again. If you have any questions about anything don't use the self check in. I did and called the front desk to ask a question and hung up after 10 minutes because no one answered the phone. Also if you want to use the pool they tell you to be there at 9am to make sure you can get a spot. That was a little frustrating but I think it's because of Covid.
40,The first day we got there we went out to have a relaxing time at the pool. Although we spent over $100 for 4 drinks we were told we couldn‚Äôt be in the large pool even though we were staying at Caesar‚Äôs palace for four nights. That night we lost $650 in the casino but the next morning when we wanted a cup of coffee we noticed there was a coffee machine but no k-cups available for it. We had to purchase coffee in our room or go down to buy some. A few days later as we were walking around the Casino we purchased a couple drinks then headed out to the pool but were stopped and told we couldn‚Äôt take the drinks we had just purchased at Caesar‚Äôs Palace into the pool area. REALLY!!!!! When we did get out to the pool my husband asked one of the Bar Waitresses for drinks and was told she could only service those people with a cabana. So my husband stood in line for a very lengthy time to get our drinks. Customer service appears to be a lower objective.    While I was waiting for him I was told I couldn‚Äôt sit at the edge of the pool with my feet in the water without a mask I had to be in the pool so I obliged as we understand the restrictions. This enforcement was not consistent especially for those sitting in the main pool with a cabana.    While I was sitting there I was approached by larger dark haired girl being extremely friendly asking if we would buy her a drink I said no. Then she proceeded to talk and laid a zipper bag along side of my leg. I asked her what she was up to and she said she wasn‚Äôt a prostitute. It was very weird later I learned she had done that to other women. I went and told my husband what had just happened so we reported it the bartender and security. Though this was not a Caesar‚Äôs issue it did not help our experience.    Your policies made us feel very unappreciated. You also left the impression that you‚Äôll do anything to charge people money.    We will visit Las Vegas in the future but Caesar‚Äôs Palace will be low on our list. We feel obligated to share our experience and unfortunately you will not be part of our recommendation to anyone.
10,"Resort fee - for what? Internet and fitness center? Couldn't find fitness center saw where it was on internet map no signs in the tower no well-marked stairs floor and elevators numbers do not jive. Also cut off my phone internet - had to use theirs which was intermittent in coming in. No comp coffee for coffee machine supposed to buy in mini bar bought our own at CVS. There was no dirty clothes bag and there was only one time cleaning should provide extra towels. No phone book hotel info strip info pen or paper provided The deadbolt did not work. The hotel/casino is very large with lots of confusing walkways and has very poor signs - need directory boards with ""you are here"" restrooms not very well marked. Wanted to find one restaurant that says it is in Caesars but never could find it. Never thought a $4 clear plastic bottle of water was a bargain until we stayed at Caesars and one place in Caesars charged $8 per bottle. At casino needed waitress for drink never came went to bar charged $10 for one Heineken - other places on strip only charged $5. Beds were decent and bathtub had wonderful jets. Overall unless I am swimming in money wont stay here again."
50,Can't say enough great things about this place! Starting with the check-in process Dany was unbelievable. It was my first time at Caesars and my girlfriend's first time in Vegas ever. Dany was extremely welcoming and had a lot of great ideas of things for us to do the whole time we were there - both on and off-site. He didn't steer us wrong and this just set the stage for the best vacation both of us ever had! We stayed from 4/29/21 - 5/2/21 and have already made plans to come back and stay at Caesars - we're now Reward Members and are Caesars people all the way! Thank you Dany!!!
50,Loved the room. Had a great time. We had upgraded to a bigger room and we had a view of all the pools. Staff was friendly and helpful. Checking in and out was a simple process. We ate at several restaurants at the hotel food and service was excellent
10,The room or floor we stayed on was outdated. Rooms shower head leakedsink faucet was loose and the bed hurt my back to the point it locked up and ruined our vacation. We could hear neighbors talk and phone alarms go off.
20,The room was nice. The rest of the place is a joke. An hour to check in. $25 for 2 pancakes! No room cleaning one day. $75 to use the in room fridge. Terrible service & unfriendly staff. Nickel & dime you to death. $51a day resort fees above the daily room rate. Limited pool hours. There is more bad . Stay someplace else.
30,My husband and I stayed here for three nights Monday - Thursday for our anniversary. We had a room in the Augustus Tower floor 40 facing the Bellagio fountains. The view was incredible. You can watch the show (and sync it up with music on Spotify or something if you find the schedule online) and you can hear the explosive sounds coming from the fountain at times too.    We like to spend time at the pool in Vegas and we were disappointed that only the Temple Apollo and Fortuna pools were open. You had to reserve a day bed or cabana even to enter the Venus or Neptune pools. Jupiter seemed to be closed entirely. The water in the Temple pool was pretty cold and there wasn't much shade (no umbrellas). There was no food service and the only drinks they had were Fat Tuesday-style slushies not good quality. We never once had someone take our order. There only seemed to be about 2-3 servers working so we went straight to the bar. There was only one entrance open to the pool area too so it was quite a walk from the Augustus (and Octavius) towers all the way to the other side.    We ended up spending more time walking around the Strip than at the pool since the hotel is so centrally located.
50,I have to give a review to give credit to Abbey and Princess in the Diamond Check in. I had a reservation for 5 rooms for my wife‚Äôs birthday. They bent over backwards to find me the suite I wanted for her surprise party and to get all of the rooms correct in the same tower and near each other. Very impressed with what they were willing to do.
30,I arrived at the property after a long early morning flight to immediately having a filthy bathroom in my palace suite . After 30mins and contacting the front desk to clean twice they made me return from the 19th floor to the front desk very tired to redeem a key card to a room on a much higher floor which changed the range of our view . Both rooms I recorded at departure.Furthermore my new room 2730 was never cleaned during my entire 3days and the housekeepers didn‚Äôt even want to give us towels off there cart when seen cleaning another room. Lastly I was charged a fee for a mini bar and I have video recording proven nothing was ever eaten from the bar and receipts for all our snack purchases . I have visited the St. Louis hotel location before and I know Ceasar can offer quality top notch service and Las Vegas has somewhat dropped the ball and disappointed me . Today after reviewing my folio I have contacted the hotel several times to be passed along and avoided offered bill department numbers that I can‚Äôt get anyone live . So at this point I have been charged extra and not even accommodated properly .
10,AC does not work half the stack doesn‚Äôt know where they are!!! Would not recommend!! Stay at a motel 8 and you will be better off! I cannot express enough how much better my stay was at the aria! Seems like this place hasn‚Äôt been update like Rest
30,They charge you for everything if they can charge you for breathing while in they property THEY WILL! I tried to use the fridge to store my water & NO it‚Äôs an additional fee. I‚Äôve been to tons of hotels none charge for early check in & caesars charge me $85.00 Dlls you guys $85 for early check in. It‚Äôs ridiculous. Now when I checked out they said that they will charge me for 3 beers that were in the Mini Bar which I didn‚Äôt drink I took a video and they said ‚Äúvideos don‚Äôt work with us‚Äù rude to the max.  It‚Äôs nice clean pools are nice but not worth all that money! Save it and go somewhere else.
20,I‚Äôd like to say another great trip in the books but what is going on in Vegas?! In particular Caesars Palace. This has been the longest we have been away from the place we love as we haven‚Äôt been since the beginning of the COVID lockdowns. Everything started out great with Tangela checking us in. Great customer service and such a professional! Got a great room and we were ready COVID be damn!    We went down to the casino and noticed immediately there was a totally different clientele. People were seriously inconsiderate and rude! I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I saw people in slippers and clothes I wouldn‚Äôt wear out in my yard let alone in a hotel/casino! The elevators reeked of weed as did the hallways. We thought maybe it was the weekend crowd but this was all five days we were there. My wife swore Caesars was having a baby convention that‚Äôs how many kids and strollers were around. Newborns and toddlers everywhere. Please someone tell me where in the heck the cocktail waitresses were too?! Practically nonexistent-right along with housekeeping!  There is NO housekeeping. Don‚Äôt let anyone else tell you different. One of the best parts of vacation is the pampered feeling of walking out of your room with unmade bed dirty towels on the floor and trash can full to come back to everything all cleaned up and you didn‚Äôt have to lift a finger!! Well you will not get THAT at Caesars Palace! I asked called down and requested and all I got was that someone will bring you up towels and trash bags! I couldn‚Äôt even have my friends that live in Vegas come to the room because it was a crap shoot when or IF someone would come get the dirty towels piling up. We haven‚Äôt been able to figure out yet if it‚Äôs Eldorado Resorts the new owners and who they are advertising to or maybe we are just in Bizzaro World. I‚Äôm thinking it must be Eldorado Resorts as our experience  Qqqq  q  Qq  was truly disappointing and I can‚Äôt figure out what they are thinking that they can run a ‚Äúresort‚Äù and not provide something as basic as housekeeping. To think we waited over a year for this!    Pros- Tangela at the front desk- check in and check out!!!! Yay  -Great view!    Cons- literally everything else!
50,First time back in almost two years due to pandemic. So MUCH FUN! Rao's Restaurant food was very good. The Steakhouse was just ok. Casino was busy no spectators at the tables - players only. Plastic separation at the crap tables but not at the Blackjack or Roulette. Slots were lot's of fun. Gotta hand it to the bathroom attendants some of the most underappreciated folks in the property. They have a tough job but all the public bathrooms were very clean.
20,"It was pretty when we entered with many Greek and Roman statues but quickly went down hill from there.We booked our room on Priceline and paid for the room prior to our visit. At check in after waiting in line 15 minutes or so they asked for a credit card to charge the extra $50 resort fee and add a $100 for incidentals that the $100 would be refunded at check out if not used. We presented an ID and credit card for these. The desk clerk told us that because my husband's ID said John and his credit card said Jack we could not check in. We had already paid for the room through Priceline. We have NEVER had this problem with renting a hotel room. We asked to speak to the manager who told us we couldn't check in. We asked if we could check in my ID and credit card. No we could only use a credit card that said John. We asked if we could pay cash and after much discernment they agreed to take the cash of $150.02 and refund the $100 when we checked out in the morning. Finally we got our room key for the Forum tower. We had to walk quite a way through the casino to the elevator to the 50th floor. Our room was quite shabby with very worn dressers and furniture. We were disappointed that there was only a shower and no tub. My husband tried to take a shower but could not get the water warm enough. There were snacks on the dresser and in a refrigerator but a sign said if you moved the items you would be charged. There was no price list for the items but I assume they were very pricey snd we refrained from touching them. We went down to the food court to the Earl of Sandwich and ordered an Italian sub for $12.99 that was tasty. I wanted a glass of wine but it was outrageously priced at $21.99! Beer was $7.99. We drank bottled water we had with us. Fortunately the beds bedding and pillows were quite comfortable and we slept well. The cutains had an electric button to open and close them but it didn't work. The mirror in the bathroom had what appeared to be a tv screen that no longer worked. The door had a lose bolt that didn't work properly and I didn't feel particularly safe. This hotel was apparently nice at one time but is truly showing its age. My husband doesn't like elevators and when we took the stairs indicated by a sign that said ""stars"" instead of ""stairs"" down 4 stories we walked through a series of back hallways and several more sets of stairs until we finally made it into the casino. It was spooky. We had breakfast at a Starbucks of a coffee bagel and breakfast sandwich for $20 but had a friendly server the first warm person we'd encountered. We were very disappointed with our experience at Caesar's Palace."
10,I could write a book request room near lobby was told was booked in back tower (even though when reserved requested close to lobby) I would have to pay 30 dollars a night more for room near lobby.  We paid extra went to room for bed at night noted crumbs on night stand and under glass at night stand crumbs on floor near and under couch a former guest ring was found on floor. In am when I awoke and threw back top covers a blood stain was on top sheet. Was told when reported issue that the union does not allow housekeeping to change bloody sheets ???  Carpet dirty all around baseboard areas tape on ceiling and walls from another guest room not cleaned last day despite only having occupied sign on for less than two hours called Front desk and was told put trash in hallway and they would leave towels on door.  $ 50 dollar daily resort fee but not able to use pool two days because was full where is my resort fee Refund  The one time at pool ordered to frozen drinks Total price $ 62 dollars no menu to reflect pricing  Dirty and run down common areas chipped paint self parking down right scary filthy needed cleaning of doors glass and elevator smelled of urine  Blatant prostitution in lobby front of hotel my son was repeatedly stopped in casino  By prostitutes  Will never return left a negative impression
20,I don't usually write reviews but I would stay away form Caesars until they can staff appropriately. It took over 30 minutes to get a drink at the pool. Very minimal food offered. Our room was never cleaned and we didn't opt of cleaning. This casino/resort has definitley gone down hill. I recommened staying elsewhwere.
10,I used to go to Las Vegas 8 years ago on a monthly basis and I frequented caesars palace and a lot of the top hotels like the bellagio Wynnaria and the Venetian. When I used to go to Caesars the front desk staff were great and cared about the client the check in area smelled amazing and the rooms were spotless. I recently booked a 4 nights at caesars palace ($330 sat night) and I was completely shocked at the lack of care by the staff and the condition of the room. The front desk had 3 people with along line. I checked in at 9:30pm at night and waited in line to check in for 30 Mins even though I downloaded the app and they confirmed I could pick up the key without waiting at a kiosk. The kiosk were closed at night I guess. Once I check in I go to the elevator where no one was monitoring the elevators most casino hotels have a staff member who scans your room key to access the elevators so they can screen who goes up. Well caesars didn‚Äôt get that memo and I was in a elevator full of scumbags who looked like they we‚Äôre gonna a rob me. Once I got to my floor I opened up the room and the carpet had garbage on the floor and the room was rough and dated. After a long flight from the east coast it was by now 1 a.m. est. I went downstairs to complain and the line was long. I could t wait 30 more min. I was exhausted so I went up the elevator and went to bed. The next morning I went to the front desk to explain how terrible the room was. The front desk staff member looked at me like she could care less and she showed it.She said they could send a cleaner but it will be a while or I can switch rooms to a newer tower for a upgrade fee. Why the hell should I pay a fee to get a clean room which is what I was expecting from the beginning. I told the lady at the front desk who could care less I would just check out early and cancel my remaining 3 nights. I got my luggage and went next door to the bellagio. I walked in to normal people I waited in line for 4 mins to Check in as they were over staffed. The check in area smelled amazing. I went the elevator. A staff member screened everyone to make sure you were staying at the hotel. Opened up my door to my room and it was exactly what I expected of Caesars palace 8 years ago‚Ä¶.great room clean smelled great and the staff at the front desk were nice.
30,The building and facilities were spectacular but I was not impressed with the cleanliness of the room. When I pulled back the sheets I noticed brown stains. I called the front desk and had to wait almost 45 minutes before housekeeping came with a fresh set of bedding. Other than this incident we had a great stay.
30,To get in pool you need to get in line an hour before they open or else you wont get in. Room needs updating and walls are so thin it‚Äôs hard to sleep. My first night I had to call front desk because it was hot AC unit was not working properly. For the price I was expecting more. Wont be staying here again.
40,Had an amazing time in Vegas. Caesers has the perfect strip location. Gambling was fun and the food was great. We were disappointed in the lack of food options late night. Even tho our room thermostat was set to 65 it felt like our room was 90 degrees the entire trip and it made it impossible to get a good night's sleep. Next time I'll bring a fan. Overall we had s great trip and would consider staying at Caesers Palace again.
30,My recent stay was less than I think I was expecting from Caesars. This was my first time staying here I normally thought this was so fancy a hotel to book. So I always stay elsewhere on our family trips to VEGAS. But the upgrade was less than desirable. I actually hated to think how much smaller a standard room would be since I had an upgrade. Then coffee maker and no coffee?? Only available for purchase at Starbucks. My 16 yr old daughter went down to rent a cabana (starting at $250) and was told $800 ?? Why?? Couldn't get a response to that one. But thank you bell desk for letting me know that this mini bar is time sensitive no where on the stickers does it say that.
10,We paid for a suite that had no TV's that worked. We paid over a thousand a night  for a room was old and dirty. The culture needs to change. the employees said that management did not want to spend the money to fix things. We called to have an engineer come to the room 3 times and not one of them could fix the TV issues. We also called 3 times for coffee and water and it was never delivered. We could not get a seat the pool on Friday due to overcrowding. We couldn't even enter the pool area!!!  I am a Stock holder in this company and this week  I will sell the stock because it is poorly run and lacks the management to set the right culture to get things right.
40,We stayed in the Augustus Tower for the 3rd time. The room was beautiful and very clean. We checked in around 1 pm and the line went pretty quickly. They did waive the early check in fee due to our Caesars rewards level. The room is 650 sf! Bed and pillows very comfortable. The reason I took one rating off is the lack of a refrigerator. We have stayed at the other CET resorts and enjoyed the use of a refrigerator. The refrigerator is full of overpriced items. Also the top of the entertainment case has a tray of more overpriced items and is really in the way to set other items there in fear of knocking something over. These two things may keep us from booking a room at Caesars Palace in the future. We didn't request any maid service and had plenty of towels for our stay. We did have a lot of fun in the casino and got a lot of play.
50,Everything about this place was the best. The food was amazing every day (or every day that we got it from a restaruant downstairs at least) the environment was very very friendly and welcoming the room was amazing with an even more amazing view. And it was for the bigger part clean! If youre going to Vegas at anytime through the week I'd highly highly recommend staying here!
50,I went on a business / fun trip with my oldest son and we had a great time. Ceasars palace was wonderful and the price was awesome. The only issue we had was our key card wasn't coded for parking so I had to pay the first time but we told them and they made it right and credited it back to me. Great customer service.
50,Fantastic stay for my Father Daughters trip to Las Vegas. Check-in was quick and we checked in 2 hours early without a fee. We stayed in the Palace Premium Studio and it was beautiful and huge. The service was impeccable. especially LJ at our pool cabana. We will definitely stay ar Caesars Palace on our next trip to Las Vegas.
30,I wanted to give a real time review of the Caesars Palace Forum tower room. This is my 6th stay (5th in a year) but the first time getting a Forum tower room. I have Diamond status and have gotten upgraded every stay but did not expect it.  I had booked the forum tower 4 of the 6 stays.  The room is actually good. It‚Äôs got a good layout and amenities. Large walk in shower with bench Double shower head in bathroom TV 7/10 bed comfort sitting area good square footage. Short walk to elevators. But there‚Äôs the problem. The elevator lobby is a standard 6 shaft. They would be adequate for the size of the tower but 2 are dedicated to the 2 penthouse suites. Leaves 4. One‚Äôs been broken. Construction Rope there. Don‚Äôt know how long. 2 others have faulted during our stay. I almost got stuck in one voice was saying to call emergency. Luckily it let me out but wouldn‚Äôt move. A crew came to work on a different one the next day as it wouldn‚Äôt close all the way. Leaving just one good elevator. ‚ÄúGood‚Äù. All of them rumble and shake on the way up and down. Very unsettling. It was probably the best thrill ride open during Covid.  They had a long time to upgrade or fix these when they were shut down or slow this past year. As I write this it‚Äôs backed up a good 20 minutes just to get up to your room during peak checkin time or the weekend.  Thank God for happy hour at Seersucker to wait it out.
40,"We stayed in the Augustus Tower in a lovely room. We could see the Bellagio Water Fountains and the Eiffel Tower. Check in was lovely and Keli who took care of us was very accommodating and took time to find us the perfect room.  Gambling was fun - the machines ""gave"" a little and we had play time.  Our dinner was perfect.  My only complaint (which is my problem) it was a good walk to get from place to place. And the cocktail waitress service seems non existent.  Check out was also perfect thanks to Jay. Lovely people working there.  Thank you to our fabulous Casino Host Jeff Glantz. We so appreciate you."
50,Zandra was very professionalI explained my situation and she took care of it.She was warm and courteous she is an example of what customers service should be .She the reason I will come back to Caesars.Cause I wasn‚Äôt happy when I got to her.
30,My expectations about the Caesar Palace were different until today because last night didn‚Äôt clean my room and not let bath towels to take a shower five stars??? I have been in other hotels of the group and it was a so diferent experience!!!!! The sad story was that this trip will be our 2nd honey Moo!!!
10,I will never book with Caesar‚Äôs. $20 for in room coffee. Never had to pay for in room coffee. Bought upgrade with details that robe and slippers are included with upgrade. Did not provide due to Covid was the reason. Makes no sense at all. With that logic Caesars would not supply towels and bed sheets. What they don‚Äôt launder the robes after each guest???
20,This is the first time staying at Caesar‚Äôs and will be the last. First off they tie up almost 1000$ in fees and security deposit when you check in. Second every other slot machine or craps machine is out of order. They weren‚Äôt fixed at all during the entire duration of our trip. Don‚Äôt even get me started on trying to order a drink. A waitress comes around MAYBE once every 2 hours. Don‚Äôt even think about using the refrigerator in your room. They are packed full of mini bar items and if you move them slightly a sensor will charge your room for the item. I called the front desk to ask if they could remove the stuff so we could put our drinks in it and they said no! Don‚Äôt advertise that your rooms have refrigerators if we‚Äôre NOT ALLOWED TO USE THEM! The valet summoning the taxis gets an attitude when he feels like your trip isn‚Äôt far enough for his liking. I‚Äôm sorry but the Venetian is not ‚Äúright across the street‚Äù. It‚Äôs at least a 15-20 min walk. There was a freaking waitlist to get in their pools. And the one thing that really burnt my biscuit is their ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS rule about wearing a mask while outside at the pool!! That is the dumbest crap I‚Äôve ever heard in my life. I‚Äôm a nurse. I am probably your biggest pro-mask person. But any idiot knows you can‚Äôt catch covid while over six feet away from someone WHILE OUTSIDE!! If you‚Äôre going to catch covid it‚Äôs going to be in their casino. They don‚Äôt make anyone wear a mask when they‚Äôre puffing away on cigarettes and there‚Äôs absolutely NO disinfectant wipes to be found. I even asked a housekeeper for wipes and she didn‚Äôt have anything I could use to wipe down machines before playing on them! Did I mention the waitress at the pool didn‚Äôt wait on us once while we were out there? When anyone flagged her down she‚Äôd say she‚Äôd be right back and never come. She only paid attention to the people that rented the overpriced cabanas. Caesars you were a huge disappointment.
40,Good place to stay on the strip. Lots of high end shops (really expensive) good gaming but accommodations were not top of the line like I was expecting. Would have liked to be upgraded at a lesser charge like I was told to ask for when I arrived.
10,Was dying to go to Vegas since forever and stayed here because I always stay at Caesars in AC well clearly the customer service is unmatched. I am having the worst experience ever.    We check in and the room is NOT clean. There's cheetos under the bed and wrappers under the other and the bed board has catches as if a cat attacked it. Then my kids room had ditty pillows. Call down and they offer to move us so we moved    Get new room and now I'm in a weed fest. Refusing to move again because now I'm further away from my kids room... wake up to bathroom flood and rude front desk staff which by the way has been since yesterday with the exception of Evander. As of this morning Yvette sent me through the roof. Wouldn't even get a manager for me.    I'm looking for another property at this point and handling on the back end. Furious to say the least. Great first time experience. NOT!!!!!!!
50,Check in process was agile and relatively quick. Great customer service from all the staff. Amazing pools we had a couple of cold and windy days but the heated pools did just great. We had the impression that safety could be improved as we had some neighbors constantly arguing and others smoking marijuana in their room but we saw no immediate action from any security staff. Overall we loved the stay and would definitely come back.
20,My wife and I stayed in Caesars Palace in Las Vegas for the first time. And it will quite possibly be our last stay here. The room that I made a reservation for was not the one I received. According to the check in clerk it was no longer available. When I asked with regard to the reservation that I had made her response was equivalent to ‚Äútake it or leave it.‚Äù The room itself leave much to be desired. I requested different pillow and was told there were none. One of the sinks was clogged up and maintenance had to be called. On the second day of our stay housekeeping did not make up our room. When calling to inquire they advised that all the staff for that department had left for the day and that we would have to wait until tomorrow. And I find it odd that if we use the refrigerator in the room for ‚Äúprivate use‚Äù we will be charged $75.00. Can you believe that?! I am so glad that we leave on Friday and as I mentioned we will not be using Caesars Palace in Las Vegas again.
20,Stayed at Caesars Palace in the Palace Tower 17th Floor Apr. 26 - 28.  A few important things check in is 4pm check out is 11 am. Parking is no additional charge for hotel guests. Mini bar $75 for use plus each item is more than $9.00 for cookies..chocolate and a small bottle of liquor $30 or more. Daily resort fee is $51.02. I'm going down my recipet list.    Self Parking- Be prepared to walk a long ways.    Casino- Very few slot machines at $0.01. Smoky. Didn't witness employees wiping down machines.    Restaurants-Lots of options expensive to eat at Casino. Recommend finding places outside the hotel to eat.    Location- Great location near a lot of shops and restaurants center to strip. Near Bellagio fountains....High Roller  .Ice Bar...multiple Casinos..    Cleanliness- needs improvement. Did not witness staff cleaning slot machines or wiping down chairs. Room was cleaned fairly well though.    First timers- I don't recommend this hotel for first timers. Not one staff member educated visitors on shows open and available now club openings interesting things to do on the strip tours and hotel did not offer services to book events. No breakfast was included or transportation.
20,The front desk lady was very short and rude. We were told that housekeeping would not come to our room or enter without us asking and they did. Didn't even really clean the room just moved our stuff around. The showers in the rooms were not thought through very well. You had to run the shower for at least 30 minutes to be able to get hot water and by the time it was up to temp your bathroom was flooded. You were allowed to be shoulder to shoulder with people in the casino but couldn't go to the pool without being put on a waiting list for hours. Extremely disappointed in the hotel and will never stay there again!!!
50,Harrah‚Äôs Las Vegas was great! Jessica at the front desk is Stellar. Great customer service and met all my needs. Jessica‚Äôs attention to details and recommendations are top notch. Even though this hotel was busy Jessica‚Äôs focus was priceless. Everyone was amazing at front desk. As a front office manager myself..... Y‚Äôall ROCK! Great team
50,I travel to Vegas often for work and had yet to stay at Caesars. I checked in at 9:50am and was greeted by Tangela. She was so kind and accommodating and made the whole process easy and client friendly. I was able to get to my room so I could do some work before I had to head to my visits. Lovely experience!
50,"I've been coming to Vegas for 20 years (with a plan usually). I decided to join some friends for a last minute weekend trip to Caesar's Palace. I do not have any sort of membership there and I was so busy at home in Cali before leaving that I just winged it and showed up with no res. I realize this is not a great way to travel but the team at CP made it work! Thanks to ""Zandra"" at the front desk she helped me find a room and have a fantastic weekend stay. I'm back in cali now but I hope to be back again soon! Thank you Zandra and the Caesar's team!"
10,****Stop Stop Stop****** Before you book. You need to know this is not a Caesars Palace that you think you know. This is a 2 Star resort now and being managed accordingly. Be aware of hidden charges and extremely expensive place to eat even a cup of coffee. We got a cup of hot water and was charged $2. They charge you for the resort fee but everything is fully booked and Un usable. Rooms are not cleaned daily and if complain they will tell you that they are short of staff and will send you bunch of towel in a plastic bag. Overall you would get a much better service at a Motel 6 . Do not even think about this place. You will be extremely disappointed with your experience. Do not ask for Manager there is none and they will tell you that. By the way I stayed at Caesars for 15 years so I know what I am talking about. This is not Caesars anymore.
20,Caesar's Palace is very bad. I forgot to call Visa and my credit card didn't go through until the third time. Without my consent; they put a charge of $600.00 on the card. The fees were to be $40 per night/tax. They ended up $51.02 with tax. They had a refrig in the room. We were to put our water in there. No room and if we took any of the things out in there; we would have been charged. There was a Keurig for coffee; but if we wanted a cup; we had to buy it in the room. Some of the help were nice but a lot were crabby. I would never stay there again
30,Prices for items drinks/snacks/meals were unreasonable. Room I stayed in had worn headboard paint coming off. Smell of weed throughout the resort. Broken glass on floor in several areas of the resort did let them know. Was gone the next time we came through the area. Pool access was far from room. Disappointed that the buffet was closed. Response to requests for items was excellent.
30,Hotel was clean and has beautiful theme and decor; pool was the best and casino was nice. Poolside drinks were refreshing on a hot spring day and hotel service was good. Housekeeping was good. Suggestions for room upgrade at check in was thoughtful
20,I‚Äôll run through a review of some for the common issues.  The resort fees cover WiFi which is limited to two devices. Completely inappropriate. Alone I have cell phone and a laptop my husband had his phone and laptop. I‚Äôm sure many travelers have an iPad or two. This restriction is absurd and decidedly not good service. What‚Äôs worse the WiFi doesn‚Äôt work! It was incredibly slow and would not stay connected. Absolute nightmare.    The prices for everything in Las Vegas are astronomical. Especially the mini bars. To somewhat mitigate this we purchased wine and water from the nearby store. After checking in we discovered our upgraded one bedroom suite did not have a refrigerator. Even roadside Holiday Inns have refrigerators! Instead Cesars has a minibar the has completely filled the one refrigerator so that nothing can be added to it. When I requested a refrigerator I was told that all were removed due to COVID. Say what? A refrigerator will give you COVID?    Cesars refused to remove the items from the minibar so that I could use the existing refrigerator. I fail to understand why housekeeping could not personally remove those items- they fill it up why can‚Äôt they infill it?    After much discussion a refrigerator was delivered- that had a capacity of about 4‚Äùx4‚Äù. I‚Äôve never seen anything so small. After addressing this yet again a larger refrigerator was brought but this only a bit larger than the first. I don‚Äôt know what kind of game Cesars is playing but this is ridiculous.    Room service itself is not available. For whatever reason you can only order from restaurants to-go orders. You can imagine how long tedious and expensive this is. Often I‚Äôd just like a coffee in the morning - but not if it takes a couple hours and costs an arm and a leg. Don‚Äôt even think about going to get one yourself line actually wrapped around two turns in the building.    The room came with a coffee maker as any 3 star hotel should. However rare in Las Vegas as our other room (friend) did not have one. The coffee itself was on the minibar which came with a charge for each cup. Approximately $20 for four K-Pods. Unbelievable.    The TV remote failed just as we wanted to shut the TV off for the night. That was approximately 12:15AM. When we called the front desk to replace or repair the remote we were told it would be 1-2 hours before someone could address it. We were expected to sit and wait until 2 in the morning for a repair on a remote?!  In summary terrible stay. Don‚Äôt waste your money.
40,Public areas were not clean. Confusing lay-out. Not everything open. Taos and old homestead were very good. Family wedding. Treated bride and groom well. Juno gardens were beautiful. Lines everywhere and not enough workers to handle crowds.
50,1st time staying at Caesars and it was very awesome. We decided for our 2nd honeymoon we would do Trump and Caesars Hotels. Caesars i will have yo say took the lead. Great atmosphere and the Forum shops and Restaurants were awesome. Definitely coming back for more. Great Valet and Express check in and out
20,"Location is good. Property is good. Service is crap unless you like standing in line. you pay $45 resort fee yet you don't get to use the facilities...we waited over 2 hours to use the pool (we left by then)...""can't because of covid""... My restaurant doesn't charge for meals we don't serve because of covid. Asked for a blanket...""don't have one because of covid"" Caesars resort is like other people that use covid as a reason to say no."
20,We just came back from staying at Caesar Palace for a week. We travel to LV often we stay at a different hotel every time to try them all out and this was our experience at Caesars.    We paid extra to stay at one of their best towers the Palace Tower which is their newest with the biggest rooms.    The Pros:    Nice hotel with a nice environment.    It's great to have the Forum Shops next door.    Our room was nice at the Palace tower.    The Cons:    Highly overpriced. We went for breakfast at Cafe Americano for example. We ordered an Avo Toast and coffee. The dishes were awful plain toast with a slice of avo thrown on top of it and some slices of dark tomato. One poached egg in the middle. The cost for this? 89.00 dollars.    We ordered a package from Amazon and they charged an extra 10.00 dollars just to hand over the package to us.    Pools were a little cold for our taste.    The cost of the resort fee is completely ridiculous since most services are closed. The fitness center is closed the Qua Baths are closed (hot tubs etc. only a few services are available) we inquired about a room Peloton machine and they never answered our request the room Internet allows 2 devices per day only. So what are they charging 50 dollars a day for?    Customer service was awful. We only got housekeeping some of the days. We asked for extra pillows and shampoo and it took them 1 1/2 hours to deliver.  45 minutes to Check-in.    Overall:    Not worth it. If you found a good deal to stay here bear in mind this is only about 50% of what you'll end up paying at the end. With the resort fees hidden charges overpriced restaurants you'll wind up paying much more.    It feels like they've become cheap they want to extract as much money from you as they can. This is totally fine as long as they offer the same quality services in return which was not the case with us.
10,"(1) Deceptive advertising: Day of arrival email said ‚ÄúSkip the line. Check in now.‚Äù We did that & then received an email saying ‚ÄúThank you for checking in. Proceed to the Express Check-in Kiosk near the front desk to pick up your keys.‚Äù The kiosk said our room was not yet ready but we‚Äôd be emailed as soon as it was ready. Two hours later after spending $18 a drink at the Lobby Bar still no email. So to the front desk I go. Needless to say frustration reigned. The treatment I received at the front desk was condescending at best. I would have been treated better as just a number instead of a person standing there. (There is a charge to ""check in"" before 4:00 p.m. according to the so-called front desk manager but that little fact was nowhere in the emails we received.)    (2) Our room was a nice large suite in the Palace Tower with 2 bathrooms & a jack & jill shower. PROs: very comfortable bed immediate hot water at faucets and lamps with dimmer switches. CONs: $75 charge if you use their refrigerator $12 for using the coffee from the mini-bar in the provided Keurig machine limited-to-no daily cleaning shower doors that leak water onto marble floors outside the shower and filthy HVAC system (see pictures).    (3) Day of departure. Caesar‚Äôs Entertainment has a great policy for veterans and their spouses upgrading both from gold to platinum on their rewards plan. But the veteran needs a ‚ÄúSalute‚Äù card for that to happen. And the ‚ÄúSalute‚Äù card has a time expiration. Due to Covid this had been the first time we were in any casino for over a year & the ‚ÄúSalute‚Äù card had expired & so had platinum status. Platinum status gets you some nice perks especially valet parking. When we checked out there was a $30 charge for valet parking on the bill. When I called Guest Services I was told that when we arrived we didn‚Äôt have platinum status and therefore didn‚Äôt have free valet for the first day. REALLY??? Why would an organization offer this great benefit to our veterans and then turn around and slam them in the face? (And by the way the ‚Äúcheck out‚Äù function on the TV doesn‚Äôt work.)    So if you still decide to stay at CP don‚Äôt plan to use the refrigerator buy Keurig pods before you get there and if you‚Äôre a veteran get your ‚ÄúSalute‚Äù card and platinum status at another Caesar‚Äôs Entertainment facility before you get to CP.    During our stay we did find out that when El Dorado bought Caesar‚Äôs Entertainment in 2020 they did away with the customer satisfaction department and it shows that they no longer care one bit about ‚Äúcustomer satisfaction‚Äù. We expected ""luxury"" and don't mind paying for luxury. but received at best low to mid range. We'll spend our money somewhere else next time."
20,We stayed 5 days and room was semi cleaned only 2 days. Got my keys from the kiosk and no directions at all from desk attendant or kiosk. Had to find my room. I had high hopes of this hotel. I was not impressed. Very disappointed with the services. A bit rundown and the walls are pretty thin. I think they're surviving off their name. I don't think I'll be going back. Sorry Caesar's Palace!
50,I just wanted to say my trip was Amazing. The room I was in was very nice and spacious. The view was Amazing and the shower was Awesome. I never heard any noise from the other rooms. The bed was really nice also and housekeeping did an amazing job.
30,The rooms where nothing special. Our itinerary said strip view they were not. We asked to be close to each other and where put on separate floors. When asked to change the desk lady was rude. No instructions on how to use the pool and jets in tube do not work. The check out was not easy. Not my favorite place to stay.
40,I frequently visit Vegas. This was my first time staying at Caesars. Upon arriving (past midnight) check in line was incredibly long the self check in kiosk wasn't working. The host not only quickly checked me in she upgraded me for no additional cost. Her customer service was amazing and for this I will return. Since this visit was during 'COVID' I was VERY disappointed that you have to wear a mask at the pool even if you are 'distanced!' Unfortunately it's not a Caesars thing but prob a local government thing. Stupid! The room was absolutely amazing 2741!
40,The main floor is quite extravagant with lots to see and do. The shopping is area is just amazing.  However the rooms are just average and the only way to get to from them is a long walk and wait at the elevators. On one occasion we waited for 30 minutes for an elevator. Granted there are stairs if you're up to it but such an extravagant place should have more elevators. There was also a long wait to check in because they only had two people working the desk area. The self-parking area was literally 1/4 mile from our room so bring your walking shoes.
20,We stayed for 2 nights. The first day the valet yelled at my husband. Was rude and mean about car locations. When he asked for the correct place to go he didn‚Äôt answer. Totally ignored.  When we get to the room there was a piece of wallpaper falling from the room like falling aparts.  Then the toilet was making noise like dropping water all the time. A never end flushing.  The day after we didn‚Äôt get housekeeping at all no towels no room made nothing. (During check in they ask me if I wanted hk and I said yes). We call housekeeping and they told us that they didn‚Äôt do the rooms at all no room service to anybody. That was unbelievable the worst part was that we saw the room across from us being made (they were there the night before).  Everything you do you have to be careful because they will charge you for it.  The place is beautiful but the customer service is terrible. I am completely disappointed.
50,Celebrating birthday and FD spelled out her name!!!! Best TM ever!! Kudos to Shelby Eric Princess and Abby. They were the best sports and took the time to spell Tori. Thank you so much. This is why we come to Vegas and stay at Ceasars !
50,everything was in perfect condition!! besides all the comfort in the room for next time i hope to have a perfect view from the room to las vegas boulevard! The housekeeper was very nice when she went to the room in the morning
10,No coffee no coffee cups no sugar no blanket no room service rude when called didn‚Äôt know about resort fees when we upgraded you get better service at motel 6 for the price we paid for upgrading
50,Love staying at Caesars Palace. We booked a room facing the fabulous swimming pools in the Octavius Towers. Everything was spotless. Very comfortable bed. Ample enough towels and washcloths. Temperature control in the room was perfect.
10,For this being a nicer hotel on the strip I was really dissatisfied with the poor quality of our stay. The TV phone sink and AC were all broken; construction was taking place in the early morning for hours each day. When reported on check out guest services basically said ‚Äútoo bad‚Äù.
20,The resort fees was ridiculous with no room service and the harassment at the pool with mask wearing outside at the pool area where we were already spaced 6 feet apart. And the people were already limited
10,I complained 4 times that my shower broke and they responded 4 different excuses why they did not care or could not help me. First time it was too late for service order. Second was come back after 11 am the next day and check in with them and maybe they could move us. Third was we were checking out that day so problem could be fixed after we left. Fourth was they did everything they could but we booked third party so they really could not do anything.
50,My husband and I absolutely loved our stay here at Caesar‚Äôs. Zandra checked us in at the lobby and was extremely generous helpful and so cheerful absolutely loved her! The room and view was perfect!
30,I had spoken with 2 managers on separate occasions before my trip and no one told me about the security deposit. I asked both managers was that all i would have to pay and they both said Yes! Neither Expedia nor Caesar's Palace told me about the deposit.
40,Our family had a very pleasant stay at Caesars Palace last week from April 13-15. It was our first time staying in this hotel and was pleasantly surprised considering all negative reviews on this site. Pros: Booked 2 Augustus tower rooms and although the concierge was not able to assign adjoining rooms we we were given 2 rooms on the same floor with excellent Bellagio fountain views. Rooms were spacious and well appointed. Next the hotel boasts several notable restaurants and bars such as Hell‚Äôs Kitchen and Vanderpump Cocktail Garden which I highly recommend checking out. Entertainment can‚Äôt be beat as well as Absinthe and Omnia are in Caesars as well. The hotel provided a mini fridge on request for my dad‚Äôs medication which was very convenient. The pool although could be a bit warmer was gorgeous and easy to get into no reservation needed on a Wednesday afternoon. Late check out was granted for a nominal fee of $30 plus tax until 2 pm which came in very handy as we had very late flights. Cons- It‚Äôs a bit tacky to be charging for parking as other hotels could afford to make this complimentary. Not making coffee and bottled water complimentary considering the amount charged per day for the resort fee is quite disappointing. Also of note it wreaks of marijuana immediately after leaving the main lobby. It may not be a big deal to others but the smell is really quite offensive. These were just minor areas for improvement that doesn‚Äôt affect our overall experience at this property. It remains to be one of the most impressive hotels in Vegas and will not hesitate to recommend it to my friends and family. It has everything you need and has the best location on the strip. Just a couple more suggestions: The hotel is huge and if you have difficulty walking unless you have a wheelchair this may not be a good option. Go on a weekday for cheaper rates and less crowded stay. Meeting place for all tours are located near the Forum Shoppes and the marker is the Planet Hollywood globe ( make a left when exiting the main lobby). Again don‚Äôt hesitate to stay at this property. It‚Äôs an oldie but most definitely a goodie.
50,Caesars is such a cool place and Gemma who works at the counter was soooo helpful. Caesars is so large it can get overwhelming but Gemma helped with tips guidance and recommendations. Caesars is a great place with a wonderful staff!
50,Starting with an easy check in with Gemma she helped us with lots of information our stay has been smooth sailing and everyone here is very helpful! We have an excellent view and our room was very clean!
20,Room smelled of deodorant and odor of Marijuana smoke became more evident as deodorant wore off. Walking hallways could smell 3 or 4 rooms each floor with marijuana odor. Apparently management is not concerned with smoking in the rooms. Room Key did not work for self park lot 3 days. Resort fee of $51 each Day? what IS that for? 10 to 40 people in line at desk Unable to address these issues :(
40,We stayed in the Augustus Suite and the room was large and clean. The bathroom had a large deep jetted tub. The property was modern the service was decent. The prices on drinks have increased recently and are a bit excessive now.
40,PROS: over all pretty good place to stay but due to COVID pool was still limited with a long wait or had to pay for a chair and some restaurants were still closed so can not blame them for that. Room was clean just about every employee we delt with was more than willing to help with what ever we asked.    CONS: only real issue was with the room and check-in. We booked a room in the Octavious Tower with a mountain view but when we arrived we asked about upgrading our room. We were basically not given the option to upgrade and the check in person basically just kept telling us how good this room was and how we were in one of the better room already. This tower is on the far end of the resort and the mountain view is barely that since we were also on one of the lowest rooms. There was also no refrigerator except for the one prestocked with alcohol and no room to use for even a drink. Would have been one thing if there were no up grades but another for him to basically not even offer it and I found out later from another couple that if we would have slipped him a 20.00 we would have likely gotten an upgrade likely with no cost. So I guess the lesson is if you want even a room upgrade you have to pay off the person helping you. Again not a bad place but I would not recommend that tower for your stay unless you request a pool view or an upper room.
10,Upgrades to a suite to find Blood on sheets put in a smoking room when i was sold a non smoking room. Manager Veronica Hernandez is useless and said my only option was to spend $1500 a night on upgrades. Said they were switching my room never even called to switch. Take your money to the aria where you will treated like the money you are spending.
50,Such a friendly guy helped check in very quick. Was clear about the security deposit when I wasn‚Äôt fully informed. He was very friendly I was very happy to be helped by him. When I come here I want to see him again!
20,We stayed from April 4th thru April 9th 5 nights. I had to request towels two times throughout the week and a garbage bag for the garage. The Front Desk told me to set everything in the hall. I blame management for this happening. We will never stay at Caesars Palace again. Our friends will here about our experience.
40,The hotel was outstanding we had a wonderful time. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable of items and events at the hotel. I just love the easy checkin/out. One aw shucks wish one cup of coffee would at least come complimentary with the room but I'm easy...
40,We stayed here on Easter Sunday April 4 2021    First impression when we walked into our room was ‚ÄúWow this is nice‚Äù! We had an excellent view of the pool area definite plus. The room was spacious and very comfortable. The jet tub was big enough for two people the bathroom itself was spacious clean. I like the tall shower with the wide shower head. Clean carpet. They have the quickest elevators I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of riding on. We enjoyed our visit so much that we have already booked our next visit to stay in the same room.    We were told $75 fee to check in before 4 pm. The mini bar fridge in our room was ‚ÄúLOCKED‚Äù and no one TOLD us nor ASKED us before we got into our room if that was ok. The cleaning person forgot to replace one of the drinking glasses. The room is a little dated and the pillows are ‚ÄúEXTREMELY ‚Äú soft. I will have to bring my own pillow don‚Äôt want to pay extra fee for a firm pillowüòä. Even with the resort fee and all their extra added fees Caesars Palace is still the best place to stay.
50,beautiful Hotel Amazing loved evertything about itso much too see in the hotel its self rooms very clean staff so sweet and very nice  will be coiming back with a group of people you will love your stay
40,We always stay at Caesar's but this trip was a little disappointing. Maybe it was because the hotel had been closed but the room was dusty in corners. Our duvet cover had a rip in it. It seemed as if they were just catching up after being closed for Covid 19. However the common areas were very clean.
40,There's a $50 fee to check in before 4pm. The mini fridge is the only fridge and charges $75 for personal use. Resort and property fees were $300 for 3 nights. Room had no hair dryer and we only had 1 soap couldn't find a fan in the bathroom but it had a random phone by the toilet haha. Gread location.lots of shopping. Make a reservation for restaurants ahead of time. Pool is beautiful. I'd stay again but keep in mind the fees.
50,Had an awesome time. We will definitely be back. Thank you! We took the trip for a break from our crazy life. Enjoyed the room the restaurants and all of the amenities offered at caesars palace. The optio. Of different pools was great. We rented a day bed on the second day and then just spent the day in chairs on our third day.
30,I went to Vegas for my birthday I actually wanted to stay at another hotel. But a great friend who picked this hotel said I would enjoy it.    The best part of the entire stay was the great pool side crew. They definetly made it a great expiernce.    The cons:  CheckN takes forever & do not use the kiosks they do not add additional guests or keep requests. Most request have to made at the front desk. The only time its free is late evening-middle of the night. I had a great pleasure to meet one of the rudest front desk members one night due to many issues & fustrations. She took it all personally and advised that my friend & I would be kicked out & escorted out. Mind you she was advised multiple times that none of these issues were her fault. It was extremely disgusting because it happened on my birthday. A supervisor disculated the situation. She was apologetic & was stern with her position. Requests we asked to be made were again not added after the incomfortable situation. We both later found out the next day. requests were not added. I‚Äôve worked in travel industry & it was sickening that most front desk folks I spoke to took it all personally & very few apologized. In all reality regardless of your social status or who you are; we all work hard so we can apperciate a good time. In addition to that this was a Mon-Mon trip plus an additional room with also room issue. I can go on & on about the negatives but it won‚Äôt do me any good.    I highly advise that due to Vegas picking up the service in some places is not up to par. Unfortunately Ceasers needs to reevualte the help they get when having personalized contacts with future or current guests. The many hiccups that happened during this trip was completely unacceptional.    The main reason I would come back to Caesars is because of the great pool side crew other than that agents in a variety of areas need to be reevulated. I think individuals need to ask them self what if this happened to my friends/family etc??. Completely unacceptable.
50,Easy Sunday check-in for a four night stay in Augustus Tower 38th floor with a wonderful view. We had a small shower issue which was fixed by an engineer within a few minutes. Without us asking the engineer adjusted the jets in the Jacuzzi type tub and changed the air filter the latter improved our air conditioning. Always available elevators where everyone social-distanced. Pools were amazing and climate controlled. So if you prefer a somewhat toastier or crisper pool you have your choice. Rooms were always freshened up albeit one night a little later. There is a city-wide shortage of maids and housekeeping is trying its best. Fresh towels and bathroom supplies daily. Poker Room dealers are the best. Table game minimums are a little higher than pre-pandemic but video versions for smaller stakes are plentiful and more relaxed.    Most under-appreciated benefit of staying at Caesars is its central location. The hotels' large grounds cuts down appreciably on the time and number of steps one needs to take to go up and down the strip. Caesars has several well maintained short cuts to the bridges across the strip as well as easy access to crosswalks. Believe me on a hot day cutting down on time and/or distance are godsends. And Las Vegas has a lot of hot days.    Thanks again to Caesars for making our first post pandemic trip a memorable time!
30,Always wanted to stay at Caesar‚Äôs Palace glad I did but was very disappointed. Did not seem very luxurious at all. I never saw anyone cleaning or wiping down anything. The casino did not seem very sanitary during Covid. They did not supply coffee in the room. With such a huge resort fee coffee should absolutely be included. Bonus free parking for guests. So many choices in Vegas.
10,The stay was ok . However after the checkout we hit with $60 charge for valet parking but we never used it so emailed the Caesars Palace customer service they were saying it takes 7 days to resolve the case but it depends on the parking company because they are the one in charge .    So the money debited by the hotel but the same day deducted again by the parking company. It's just so amazing and desperate attempt to keep customers money for a service never been used .    This was one the first and last stay at Caesars.
50,Xavier made my check-in smooth. I originally booked a few days for a retreat but arrived early to add 5 days to my stay. He extended my reservation without any issues was professional from start to finish. He even told me a bit about Gordon Ramsay whom I'm determined to see while I'm here. Thanks Xavier for your help! I know I said I'd have my review up in 24 hrs but I still did it. I appreciate you! @ashleyapple131
10,So I booked this through Travelocity some months back. I booked a Studio and there was no problem with pricing or check-in.  The problems started after check-in. 1st of all there were 3 times more children there than adults. The pool was overbooked all three days we were there and the hotel had a policy that masks were mandatory while not in the actual water...that's right even with social distancing protocols mask tan lines.    None of the essentials shops were open except the one in the main lobby. The food courts and restaurants except the high priced one didn't open til 11am.  There was a keurig machine in the room but the hotel offered NO K'cups.    Customer service was non existent at Ceasers.    Even though we prepaid the studio Ceasars charged me a $51/day resort fee after the fact and would not give me a logical reason why.    Never again will I stay at a Ceasers property
50,"My boyfriend had walked through several casinos years ago with his family. When we decided to plan a last minute trip to Vegas this month he recommended I book this hotel. This humongous hotel was amazing and classy!! There were so many exquisite details put into the decor sculptures fountains art work lighting flooring etc.  . I'm not even sure what percentage of the hotel we actually walked through due to its' size. Our room that was in 'The Palace' floor 5 room 500 overlooked part of the pool area. It was well maintained and very clean. Maid service came everyday. In our room we had a king bed (super comfortable) for the two of us had TWO separate bathrooms with a spacious shower dividing them- what a cool concept. We don't have trouble sharing a bathroom but this was an unexpected surprise (didn't read the room descriptions close enough I guess). A strange perk we didn't get with the room were coffee pods for the Keurig. You could ""buy"" a coffee package from their min bar selection for around $12 (without even knowing what or how much was in the box-but it was quite small). We went to CVS instead and bought a big coffee pod box for$10. We had appetizers drinks and a breakfast at the restaurant by the lobby (can't recall the name?). The menu is fairly small but we still found delicious things to eat. There was a crazy amount of places to eat at in all different types of cuisines and price points. We ate at their food court one day for lunch which had some decent options if your short on time. Beware however-we got a hoagie at one place and a single can of pop or sparkling water was $5.99. Per can?? Guess we should've walked down a ways and bought one at the many shops throughout the hotel or brought our own. We knew things would be expensive in Vegas but some prices are ridiculous (we aren't cheapskates by any means just try to be conscious of the price gouging going on). We thought about enjoying the pool for an afternoon but having to ""rent"" a pool chair for $100 per person changed our minds pretty quick. $200 to swim for a couple hours at ""our hotel""?The pool opens at 9:00 am and people started lining up at crazy early hours yet that still wouldn't guarantee a spot (and remember this was during COVID- I can only imagine what it's like during ""normal"" years trying to ""rent"" a chair). However we had no problem paying $175 for an amazing massage at their beautiful and calming spa. Although many parts of the spa we couldn't use due to COVID the staff did their best to pamper us. The hotel was centrally located within the strip which made walking all over a breeze. One day we walked over 6 miles! We did need to take a cab a couple of times. The hotel had an employee that organized getting cabs for each group and then telling the driver where we needed to go. Super quick and easy. We aren't into gambling yet still had lots of fun going to shows museums restaurants and shops. Our 4 day/3 night stay left us wanting to return soon for another much longer stay."
40,First of all I‚Äôm Horribly disappointed with the turn Vegas Strip has made in their Blackjack rules. Only found tables that pay 6-5 and $25 minimum. If you‚Äôre a cheap gambler like me this is NOT the place for you!!    Now for Caesar‚Äôs- it‚Äôs a beautiful place. It‚Äôs honestly not any greater than Paris across the street. Paris is much more reasonably priced. Drink staff at the tables is VERY scarce!!
30,I expected a lot more from a high end hotel. We did not have any extra blankets or towels no fridge and we had a suite. Check in & check out was not easy and took long to process. Overall not satisfied considering the fact that this is a high end hotel.
40,So if you are completely social distancing at the pool in your chair in the sun you have to wear a mask? You can totally swim and talk to strangers in the pool with no mask. Hotel was great but who wants a suntan with a mask?
50,I love everything about this hotel I will be coming back it will just amazing seeing all the statues and the restaurant was great and all the stores on the shopping area was great the view of my room was everything
10,The room I was in had someone‚Äôs throw up inside of it was not mine & it was dirty face hairs in the sink. Nasty how did someone not clean the room before someone coming ! Nasty I will not be going back
30,Check in process was a complete nightmare. Our room was cleaned once during our 5 night stay. They charged us for drinks in the room that we never drank. Customer service is horrible. Casino was good.
30,We got a good deal on the room however the room seem outdated furniture was old  Our parking card didn‚Äôt work our full stay super annoying.  We choose not to have our room cleaned however when we asked the cleaners for additional towels they only gave us 2. Also we were woken up one morning around 6 by a loud alarm coming from an inside speaker when I tried calling the front desk it took them about 5 min to answer.  We actually expected more from  this hotel ! :(
20,My card was charged over $2000 and I had already checked out! They put the next guests charges on my card! Also I had two pending charges for my stay - $400 and $199. Nobody could tell me why. It took 5 days to get them removed.
20,For Caesars Palace I was disappointed. For three days my room was never cleaned even when I called and asked. The light in the restroom didn‚Äôt work there was no vent in the restroom or bathroom when showering the water kept turning off and on which was extremely frustrating.
50,My wife & I took a Vegas trip to spend some time away together. Southwest cancelled our booked 12pm flight & moved us to a 6am flight. We rolled with it knowing that we could at least check our bags in and hit the Strip until our room was ready. Upon check in Jeannie (sorry if I misspelled) kindly asked about our morning departure & said she would call us immediately upon our room being ready. She was very kind & compassionate. We checked our bags in and headed for the Strip planning on being out half the day. To our surprise a little while later Jeannie called saying our room was ready. Needless to say we ecstatic that we could settle in after a very long morning! Caesars Palace lives up to all the rave reviews so much to do and so many wonderful people make this casino the gold standard on the Strip! Also wanted to give a shout out to Montecristo Cigar Bar great assortment of cigars and top notch old fashioned's. We can not speak highly enough of our recent stay it was important for us to mention what an amazing Caesars staff especially Jeannie. We will not forget this trip!!
50,We had an amazing quick stay at Caesars! A huge thank you goes to Tomek at the front desk. He was simply the best!!! He made sure we had exactly the room we wanted and understood everything we needed to know about this amazing resort. He was kind and patient and a pleasure to talk to. The resort itself is beautiful and so fun. And at the end of the night after roaming around some other locales it just felt right coming back to Caesars. Again Tomek made sure we knew where everything was and where to go if we had questions or needed anything. He is a credit to your organization. We cant wait to go back!
40,Our only real issues with Caesars this trip was the lack of communication regarding the pool capacity. Due to Covid obviously there are headcount limitations. Most of the day it won't be an issue but text down to the pool EVERY TIME you are considering going down or else you may be really disappointed when it's full and you need to get into a virtual waiting list without any real idea of how long the wait will be. Our first day was super disappointing because this wasn't disclosed to us at check in resulting in me waiting outside of the pools for 45 minutes with 2 really bummed out travel weary kids. Aside from that the rooms were in good if not pristine shape. The building is obviously really cool to walk through though it's ENORMOUS and I cannot stress to you enough to BRING COMFORTABLE SHOES and to expect to wait for everything.
10,This Place is so over priced it is Ridiculous. $7:50 for bottled water. They Put a coffee maker in the room. Guess what you have to buy the kurig cups. The room is old run down and worn out. Never say anyone cleaning a slot machine!  I guess Covid-19 doesn‚Äôt exist at Caesars Place!!!! Never again will I stay there.  Take your hard earned money and enjoy at a different resort! Stay far far away
20,We recently returned from staying at Caesar‚Äôs Palace and while it was okay it definitely did not meet our expectations. I‚Äôve never been one to spend my time writing a review but after this experience I was left a little disappointed.    We were very excited to stay at Caesar‚Äôs Palace after staying at the Paris in November. The room itself was clean and modern and did met the description online. We were given a room on the 5th floor of the Palace tower so our only view was of a roof. After calling down to the front desk to see if there was anything else available the rep that we spoke to was less than helpful. We decided it wasn‚Äôt a big deal and just let it go.    Something else that really bothered me was that housekeeping did not clean our room at all during our 5 day stay. We would be gone for 12-13 hours a day and upon our return we were always surprised that our room had not been cleaned. Luckily we were able to call down to get extra towels brought up to us.    Overall Caesar‚Äôs was just okay. This was the 2nd Caesar‚Äôs property that we have stayed at in the past 6 months after staying at the Paris in November but after this experience I will be looking in to other options when we return to Vegas
30,This place has gone down hill. Not the best for families w/kids. Rooms-Beds uncomfortable shower lame and bracket falling off the wall. The cigarette smoke was gross and all throughout the main casino.
50,Abbey was outstanding with helping us at check-in and added the additional room we needed. She has to be one of the best concierge I have ever had an experience with and extremely pleasant. I will certainly come back and stay here at the Palace whenever I come in town.
50,Best hotel there brilliant place been to them all very nice there gambling is the best you see others attending from other hotels when asked they prefer it there will return and use this not tryd New York one yet thoy
20,I have stayed at multiple Caesars properties on the strip and I have enjoyed all of them except for this one. I checked into the room and then walked up and was instantly turned off. The floor had multiple stains and was ripped. It didn‚Äôt look like they vacuumed so I called down and they instantly switched my room. When I got to my new room it was even worse. The floor was not vacuumed there was hair all in the bathroom the mirrors were dirty and they didn‚Äôt dust. The worst part was the bed there was a large red stain boogers smeared and a rip in the comforter. I was so tired at this point I called house keeping to just come change my bed and I would deal with the rest. It was dinner so I left and when I came back that night I had to make my own bed because they just left the sheets inside the door. Also I know COVID is still a thing but it was super hard to find breakfast. The only place open in the food court was Starbucks and the line was a mile long. I would say save your money and stay at a different property on the strip.
30,Non-negotionable fee to use the pool..We tried but were told they were at capacity.    Pools are a LONG hike!! Got in once IN 4 DAYS ONLY to find there was NO CHAIR ON WHICH TO SIT!    Fee should be only for those who get to use the resort!
40,The hotel was amazing close to everything that you needed. If for any reason you had to go anywhere that was not within distance they had taxis available for you. Hotel was clean and plenty to do there and the staff assisted you with anything that you wanted.
50,My fianc√©e and I love Caesers Palace. It has great pools and the best location. Elpidio helped us when we checked in and provided exceptional customer service. He is a great value to the company! Thank you for a great couples weekend away!
10,Hotel is open to full capacity but most shops are closed or at 50%. No room service at 11. Hour wait for everything including checking in they do not care about your time. I will stay somewhere else next time.
30,Front desk sucked clerks were rude no housekeeping.had to ask for towels. Toilet backed up a 4 hour wait for engineer . Hot water slim. No ice in ice machine.sad trip...    Will try Reno or Tahoe next time. Not a ceasars resort either!
30,Room was nice spacious and clean. The thing sI didn‚Äôt like was the fact that they do have a coffee maker but do not have complimentary coffee. No bathrobes even though their website shows guest in bathrobes. Their room service (you can have delivered or pickup) which is food from the restaurants tasty good quality but for breakfast my kids like pancakes but the pancakes were $21. Other than that. Pools were incredible friendly staff
50,My husband booked caesars as a birthday present and I couldn't have been happier! The service there was amazing and everyone was so helpful! Florante B at check in was so nice to us and even helped us with a better room and the room was spectacular! We had also rented one of the day beds at the pool and Cody was amazing! She literally could not have been more helpful. She even brought me her own sun screen because I forgot mine! Loved spending my birthday here would do it again!
50,Came here due to a bad experience at another hotel on the strip. What a difference! I had not stayed here before and I am NOT sure what everyone is complaining about but if this is bad then sign me up! Yes there were some annoying COVID-related things like limits on the number of people at the pool etc but it was necessary not in their control and enforcement was greatly appreciated! I always thank everyone for COVID-related enforcement we all should. Just plan your day and beat the crowd. I am sure the staff will adjust quickly and the bad comments will disappear. We are very sad to leave!!! We stayed at the Palace Tower (it was nearest the pool entrance) at a most wonderful suite with double bathrooms (connecting shower) and it was perfect for a family with teens. Plenty of space and hard to leave the room it was so very nice and clean! Everyone was amazing!
30,Overall disappointing stay. I‚Äôve had great stays but this was not one of them. Room was not ready until 5 and check in took 30 minutes . Makes it difficult to get ready for dinner reservation. Overall lack of empathy and and my assigned host was not helpful and stopped responding to my inquiries. Now that the Mlife properties are fully open I would recommend staying there
40,The property is pretty although colossal. I didn't see enough restrooms on the gaming floors and waitresses. The forum shops is amazing and a shoppers delight. I would go to another property and shop at the forum.
40,We stayed in the Octavius Tower great view of the pool. Room was very clean and appeared to have some recent TLC. Caesar's now has Keurig coffee makers in the room. Bing your own Keurig cups. Overall great stay!
50,Of course after a year of hibernation our first trip from home on a plane we went back to Vegas.  We wanted to see if our friends that we have made over the years were doing well so we stayed at our favorite hotel Caesars.  Check in was fine easy if you are Diamond or above and the Diamond/Seven Stars check in was still there. Check in staff was great welcoming and accommodating.  Stayed in the Octavius Tower always a great tower and nice room. Room was clean but furniture is a bit tired. Great view of the pool. Pool entrance was routed threw the Palace tower and one entrance in and out. Access was handled very well bit may take some time. We got a cabana in the Apollo area(furniture very worn out). We had a problem with our TV Jason who assisted us tried to get it fixed but instead was granted permission to move us and wow did we get a lovely surprise and upgrade to the Bacchus VIP cabanas! This was a lovely cabana the way all cabanas should look and feel. Our server was Peggy who was fantastic! She worked VERY hard to meet our needs being one of only a few servers who worked the in the entire pool area. Caesars send more help! Only down fall of our first return back was the lack of staff for the entire property. Just not enough help. Not everything was open especially in the food side. Just to get some coffee in the am was tough. Gift shops which had snacks or drinks were also closed and only open a few short hours except for the main entrance shop.  Make sure you make a reservation anywhere you can if not you gonna wait a while.  If you have not learned patience after being home for so long don't come if you have then I recommend coming to Vegas. We hope that the Caesars Entertainment folks work out the issues with hiring more staff updating furniture and opening more food venues. They should appreciate the wonderful staff they have now everyone we met or who served us were wonderful! Give them all a raise!
10,We are LV locals. We got a 2 night comped room mid week. Still had to pay a nightly resort fee of $45.00. For what... we don‚Äôt know. FREE is free to me but not at Caesar‚Äôs. We valeted our car. Checking in was a long line with only 5 attendants. Took over 25 minutes. Not enough help. It was 2pm. Was told checkin was not till 4pm. Sorry. BUT a room could be ours now at 2 for just $40.00. No thank you. Then another magical room offer upgrade for only $35.00 ready now. No thank you. Don‚Äôt try to up sell a room for a lousy 2 hours and charge for it. After only 35 minutes we were notified room was ready. How pathetic was that. Picked up room keys. On 8th floor in the Augustus tower. Hallway was beat up. Room was right next to the cleaning staffs storage room. Terrific. Immediately called desk to request another room as we didn‚Äôt want to hear noise all night from staff. No problem but we had to go back down for keys and paperwork. Forget it. They wouldn‚Äôt bring it up to us. Now for the room. Small dark low ceiling (7-8 foot) and it was so beat up. No view. There was a Roman type lounge chair that was disgusting. Who would sit on it? No tub only shower. No separate commode room...where do you see that anymore? Towels were thin and old. Room was again so small. Basic toiletries. Honestly we haven‚Äôt stayed in a room this bad in many years. Like a cheap Holiday Inn you find on an interstate. Went down to the Players Club Desk. Another joke. Took about 40 minutes to get helped. They blamed it all on COVID. Give me a break. Casino has good slot games but was smoky. Hey what‚Äôs the deal with all the dogs üêïüê© in the hotel and casino?? Who is going to bring a pet to Las Vegas? Especially to a casino. I can tell you who...someone too cheap to pay for boarding at home. Must be very enjoyable for the dog. Tell me this...where does one take it when it needs to relieve itself? I was very bothered by this because I love animals. Kids in the casino area too. Young clientele that looked hard. Not what we expected for sure. We went to the Vista Lounge one night. $18.00 for a Crown and soda. And $9.00 for their potato chips. Who charges for potato chips? Caesar‚Äôs that‚Äôs who. I can‚Äôt recommend staying here. Wynn Bellagio and Venetian will take better care of you. And the surroundings are much nicer.
20,"I want to start my review by first prefacing that I am a Caesars Diamond Member and have stayed at almost all Caesars properties. This experience left a lot to be desired when compared to Caesars casinos and hotels and is significantly more disappointing when you compare it to casinos and hotels from other brands.    As I am writing this I am on my 4th day of staying at Caesars Palace checking in on April 3 and staying for a total of 5 nights. Most of my experience has been mediocre.    My first issue was in the self-parking structure. One of the ticket machines was broken jammed paper and it just so happens that is the entry I selected. No problem just back up and select a new lane right? Wrong. I had 7+ cars piled up behind me and more cars kept coming. The button to call an attendant didnt work and I was stuck due to the traffic jam behind me. After that situation eventually worked itself out I parked grabbed my items and walked to the casino elevators. I passed a casino staff member and told him about the parking machine not working and he tells me ""it's been like that for a few days now. Not sure why they haven't fixed it."" Excuse me!? Days! Come on put up a sign that says ""Do not use this lane"" or maybe a cone to prevent people from selecting that lane. The fact they did nothing is confusing and frustrating to me.    Usually most of the Caesars properties have a line dedicated to Diamond Members for faster service but at the time I was checking in there was no one staffing this area at Caesars Palace. I thought this might be due to COVID regulations or staff downsizing but the next afternoon I saw that the Diamond Member line was open. I can only assume that they didnt have enough staff to dedicate to the Diamond Members line as the hotel was very busy. Probably the busiest I have seen since we are going back to pre-COVID days. At least the check-in line moved decently fast. Kudos to those workers. The check-in process was straightforward and a nice front desk staff member welcomed me and offered to move me to a room with a view of the Bellagio fountain without any cost. The caveat was the room was handicapped accessible which meant it only had a shower and no bathtub. This was not an issue for me so I accepted the offer. Little did I know what I was getting myself into. After finishing the check-in process I go to the Augustus tower elevators up to the 35th floor and walk down the long hallway. Entering the room is when things continue to go downhill.    The room smells of food. Not like someone on the floor is having room service dinner it reaks of food as if someone is having a potluck or buffet served. I start to unpack my items which the entire time wondering where this food smell is coming from and continuing to get worse. After poking around I notice the mini bar fridge is cracked open. I made the poor decision to open it and was greeted by 3 huge tinfoil take-out boxes filled with food. These take-out boxes were so large that they had removed everything from the minibar fridge tossed it on top of the bar and tried to stuff all of this food in. There was not even close to enough room so the minibar fridge door wouldn't close which means the food stuffed inside was spoiling. Disgusting! I called down to the front desk and the staff was not sure who to call housekeeping minibar attendants maintenance? After him checking on this he had housekeeping come and collect the food. This poor woman arrives and takes these 3 gigantic take-out boxes which are smelling of rotting food and apologizes multiple times. Before she leaves I ask her who is going to restock the minibar fridge and also to make sure I am not billed for any of these items. She assures me someone will come and handle the minibar fridge situation. Not only does no one ever come but no one ever even follows up to check on things. Since I was exhausted I decide to leave most items packed and call it a night. I crank the AC and hope that will remove most of the smell and fall asleep.    The next morning I wake and the room still smells like The Pasta Barn. I am grossed out and call down to the front desk to inquire about my options to resolve the situation. Maybe send housekeeping to do full decontamination of the room? Maybe move me to another room? Maybe offer me a free dinner for my troubles? Maybe some gambling credits so while they give the room a thorough cleaning I can kill some time? Not only was nothing even offered the staff member says they can maybe move me to another room but I need to go down to the front desk and request such. This was surprising to me as other casinos and hotels will usually send staff to the room with new room keys and even help you move items between rooms but apparently I am just not worth the time. I collect my belongings and trek down to the lobby and talk to another front desk staff. She says they dont have anything comparable available doesn't offer an upgrade doesn't offer an apology and tells me she has a room on the 25th floor with terrible views but thats all she has. I am not even joking when I say she said ""terrible views."" She didnt even try and make it sound like a decent room. At this point I am annoyed tired from not sleeping well and just want to get to a new room so I accept whatever she can offer and change rooms dragging all of my luggage back to the elevators to the new room.    Can you imagine my disappointment when I get to the new room and it has no views unless you consider the roof of the hotel a view and it's very dirty. Unique liquids on the floor and chairs the bed was not made some of the lights didnt work wi-fi service in this area of the hotel was poor among other things.    Now I understand that casinos and hotels are suffering through COVID and getting back to normal is going to take time. But it seems like Caesars Palace doesn't seem to care much about their patrons. All I am asking for is a decent room that is clean and has wi-fi that works and no weird fluids on all of the furniture and floor. Is that asking too much?    With 2 more days and 1 more night left I am nervous about what else I might experience next."
50,My mom and I came to Vegas on a last minute girls trip. We have spent many a long weekend over the years in Vegas being one of our favorite places for a quick getaway. Normally we stay at another resort on the strip and had booked that as usual. Upon arrival though we were in disbelief at just the level of people and lack of respect for masks and social distancing. The pool line was over 100 people and family‚Äôs crowded an hour before the doors even opened. We knew this was not the place for us any longer. And in a turn of events found ourselves at Caesars and could not be happier. Staff were incredible and courteous and had no issue welcoming us same day. We were able to secure reservations for the pool guarantee-ing a place to enjoy the sun and relax as we had envisioned for this trip. Staff were diligent and respectful enforcing the mask and safety policies giving my mom and i peace of mind that we were in great hands. After this we will be Caesar clients for the foreseeable future.
10,We will not return to Caesar's any time soon! From my initial check in right up until check out I felt like just another number...at check-in I waited in a line only to be re-directed to another longer line. After checking in from line #2 I was provided my room. The room was great but everything is extra. If you open the weighted refrigerator you are charged $60. The hotel does not even provide free coffee- it's $20 for coffee!!! At check-out the express kiosk did not work so one of the employees named Adrianna said she would take care of my check-out and email me the bill. I never received an email but I was double charged!!! I had to call my credit card company to dispute the charge!!! Awful service Caesar's you are not worth it.
50,Kudos to Tyler W.! Such amazing host for this trip. Helped me and my family with my room needs.  Very friendly accommodating and personable.    The hotel room was clean huge with two bathrooms.    Room service was great!    We will come back next month to see Tyler W!
50,I would stay here every time I come to Vegas! From the beginning to the end and in between was easy and great! Right in the heart of the strip too! My room was able to see the light show from the Bellagio Hotel!
10,Stayed for 4 nights the room was comped. Got home to find $600 in charges for resort fees and valet parking (never valeted a car). Signed a bill that clearly stated $0.00 in charges only to get charged $37 a day in ‚Äúresort fee‚Äù. I have no issue with the cost don‚Äôt have me sign a document that says $0.00 and then charge me $37 a day.  Also the hotel is charging $11 for a beer. That is embarrassing. I would be ashamed to gouge my guests. Just avoid Las Vegas in general at the moment as the entire place has lost their minds. Shower had no water pressure the bath tub flooded as well. Avoid at all costs.
30,What Cesar‚Äôs got right  Check in/check out very quick.  Room was spacious & clean bed very comfortable and the shower water was hot.  Numerous places to eat on site and within walking distance.  Staff on the casino floor and in the various shops/restaurants were very helpful and polite.    What Cesar‚Äôs got wrong  Wifi is sketchy  Charging for self parking  I had to call 3 times and it took over 4 hours to deliver a medical refrigerator to room.  Limited housekeeping services means your room is not cleaned until you check out. I put the trash from the room in a bag outside the door and it sat there for a day even though towels were delivered to my room they failed to take the garbage. During my stay it was not uncommon to see garbage in the hallway. Not what I expected from a Cesar‚Äôs property.
20,"My wife and I stayed at Caesars in March 2021 and the experience was dreadful. Here's a quick recap of our experience:    - The first room we walked into had half-eaten food and crumbs on the furniture along with some sort of sticky syrup substance on the walls and a tub that didn't work. The front desk moved us to another room fine. (Since this is vegas I expected at least a small upgrade but whatever)  - Next up we had a $100 ""Celebration"" dinner since we are diamond members. We went to Giada restaurant and where we were reminded that we had the $100 to use GREAT! Except when we went to use the credit when the bill came they said that they ""couldn't find the credit on our account"" This is weird because we were told by everyone ""Mr Frank don't forget to take advantage of your credit!""  - Their way of making up for this embarrassing experience was to give us another credit to use and comp one night of our stay. Again this sounds great until I got the bill and they didn't comp the room or apply the credits.    All in all I spend more time on the phone with customer service switching rooms trying to figure out credits and BS back and forth than I did enjoying our vacation.    I want to give some positive shout-outs to the Giada restaurant for AMAZING food and the pool bar staff for being super-friendly.    I would stay away and try somewhere else."
10,I have stayed here multiple times in the past and not sure I will ever stay here again. There was dog crap in the lobby room was not clean shower and both sinks backed up and toilet leaked. People smoking weed inside the hotel. We left a day early because we were so disappointed.
30,I‚Äôm not exactly sure if it was the pandemic or the norm for this hotel but I found my stay mediocre and I‚Äôm not a persnickety person.  I‚Äôll keep it succinct. My 23 year old daughter chose the hotel. Our room was in the Octavius tower. Room was large but shabby had a great view of the pools beds were super comfy no fridge or coffee maker only overpriced mini bar ( not a surprise).  In the mornings couldn‚Äôt get coffee or breakfast without waiting in a ridiculously long line. Lots of frustrated people. I went without breakfast or coffee every morning. My choice.  Paid 175 for a daybed at the temple pool. Too many kids. I picked the wrong pool I guess. No coffee available at the pool (wishful thinking) pool menu was very limited and they were out of several items by 2pm. Ordered a roast beef sandwich and it was delicious. The service was super slow but the cocktails were very good. They are obviously understaffed but the staff they did have were working like dogs. The pool was beautiful.  We ate outside the hotel most nights as my daughter had places picked out in advance but we did eat and have drinks at the cafe near the registration desk on two occasions and it was pretty good.  This place is too large for my taste but I will say that every employee I came into contact with went above and beyond to provide great service.
10,On the night we stayed at Caesars‚Äô Palace hotels at all of the large Vegas resorts were $270 or below. ($270 for Wynn or Encore $200+/ for Mirage etc.). My gf really wanted to experience the pools at Caesars. So we booked a room for just under $500. When we got to the hotel we used the super cool automated check in machines. They were great. But that was the first of many times that Caesars let us know that they are there to nickel and dime us throughout our stay. We opted to pay the $75 early check in fee so that we could drop our bags and get on with our day. 4pm was the normal check in time which is later than most hotels that I go to. (Note: I‚Äôm a Marriott rewards member and used to Marriott‚Äôs amazing customer service and accommodation. Stepping out of the Marriott ecosystem made me feel like I had been living a lift in the Truman Show where Marriott just maintains this fantasyland of perfection for me). Marriotts are very well maintained accommodating clean on and on. The room was outdated and thoroughly damaged. The water pressure fluctuated as if we were in a third world country. The bathroom mirror had an inoperable TV inside of the mirror making it feel like a real throwback to when that was a neat fad. The baseboards were heavily damaged all of the furniture in the room was outdated and damaged. Even the $30 conair magnifying mirror on the counter in the bathroom was unplugged because the light didn‚Äôt work. The hotel just clearly doesn‚Äôt care about maintaining a high standard. I have stayed in $80/night rooms that I would have gladly taken over this $500 per night room. And the neglect and damage wasn‚Äôt limited to the room the elevators had broken tiles and damage.    As I mentioned we were there for the pool. Then we learned that the pool has limited and restricted capacity due to COVID-19. So you can put your name on a list and wait hours to see if you can get in. But if they give you a spot you only have 15 minutes to get in. Once in the pool area there are almost no chairs. We asked a few employees if certain chairs were available. They said that they were. Then we sat down and within ten minutes an employee asked us ‚ÄúSo how would you like to do this room charge?‚Äù Confused I said ‚Äúyou mean drinks? Yes room charge please.‚Äù No the chairs were $100 but he was going to do it for $60 for us. What a guy. These weren‚Äôt those premium cushy beds that are poolside this wasn‚Äôt VIP stuff. Don‚Äôt go here.
50,Nice property.plenty of wagering options.dealers and staff are friendly and helpful.only thing missing is horse racing and sports betting.the comps are off the charts.will come here more often in the future but it's a classy resort..5 star
30,Enjoyed the room and the view offered. Is very sad to see they no longer have concierge who happened to be most helpful on previous trips. Supposedly due to covert 19 no housekeeping was available. At no time during check in or on one call to housekeeping were we informed her this was going to be a situation. We would have been absolutely fine with that if we were told upfront. Could have same to her towel to take her own trash down. It was not until a second call to housekeeping at this point was clarified. Trash was seen in the hallways as well as on every elevator ride. During this time also please be aware many shops are no longer open 24 hours. Restaurants can be almost impossible to get into. And the expense on everything is through the roof.
50,This palace is amazing.  Super comfortable rooms.  Clean everything they have in the room is good quality. Friendly staff that show you how important a client is. What really amazed me was their knowledge of Vegas.  Every section of the resort is beautiful.
50,Let‚Äôs be real. We all have been locked down for over a year. At first I bought into the idea that we would take a ‚Äú3 week pause‚Äù but now that we are at 13 months... I‚Äôm done! I decided that since I am a Diamond Member of Caesars Rewards that I would check the rates. Remember just 4 weeks ago. Nobody was in Las Vegas. Now this place is on fire! There are PEOPLE... And I mean lots of people! My experience at this property began today. I have a large following on Facebook and I plan to vlog many of my experiences. I checked in at VIP and was so fortunate to meet JAY who is a true Customer Service Superstar! He got me checked in at 1:00- nearly 4 hours early. he knew right away who I was (maybe from YouTube) and he was so sincere accommodating. He put me in a room on the 24th floor and the room is... you can look at the photos! Leaving Guest VIP I started to trek my way toward the tower I am in. When I look out my window I see the most insane pool ever! On my way to the resort I stopped to get some treats and some Coca Cola. Because of Covid they can not deliver refrigerators but just as I was looking around the room in popped Kevin from Engineering. He told me not to worry about the no fridge issue and left. 10 Minutes later there is Kevin.. With a BUCKET of ice... Problem solved (see pics). So now here I am all checked in and ready to spend 4 amazing days at this Supreme Property.
30,Pros-  Bathroom was huge/2 sinks and private toilet.  Room was huge.  Easy access to self parking without needing to drive of Vegas Blvd.  Cons-  We were there for 5 days and the room was not cleaned once.We we‚Äôre not supplied with garbage bags and had to use our own shopping bags to haul trash out as it was piling up.  No coffee maker.  Had to pay $75 to use mini fridge.  Only given 2 bath towels ( registered 4 guests).  Took 3 requests to finally get two more towels.  Very difficult to find our way around this hotel even after downloading the map.  Small flat screen TV that was glitchy.  Only two devices could use wifi without paying $15.... this is not cool for a family of 4!  We found things in the room at check in- champagne cork and a thong in the dresser... guessing this room was not thoroughly cleaned.
40,We always stay at caesars and always love it. It‚Äôs a beautiful place that we are just in awe with all the statues and art. The only downside was the lack of housekeeping. I suspect they laid a lot of during the lockdown and either haven‚Äôt any enough employees or are trying to financially recoup by keeping housekeeping to minimum. We had to chase down towels & I suspect that will be temporary but other than that it was great
50,We enjoyed are stay at Caesar Palace.. The Palace tower is awesome! Comfortable beds and clean room.. location is very accessible.. the forum and restaurant is a plus..it's a great hotel every thing is there.. shopping comfort and restaurants..
20,Waited in line for over 30 minutes to register. Rented a cabana at the pool and the tv did not work. Room smelled like marijuana and they said it would be 45 to get someone to fix it. Self parking garage gate didn‚Äôt work and it took over 15 minutes to get out of the garage. Lie for coffee was over 45 minutes.
20,We stayed 5 days at Caesar‚Äôs and never had our room cleaned because they said they were short on staff. However there was plenty of staff reminding us constantly when we were at the pool outside 6 feet away from other guests to pull up our masks even when drinking their $21 drinks! We use to love Caesar‚Äôs but it was not good this time!
50,Had an amazing 2 day stay at Caesars Palace. Tangela at the front desk was amazing. It was our first time here and she provided all necessary information to help make our stay more enjoyable. She also saw that both of us in our party had recent birthdays and gave us a free upgrade to a suite! It elevated our stay and we are so thankful for all her help!
10,Nothing was available to the guest not even housekeeping we couldn‚Äôt even get clean towels hard time trying to get reservations at the restaurants hotel employees was very rude couldn‚Äôt gain access to the pool unless you paid really couldn‚Äôt gain access to anything that was supposed to be free for hotel guests unless you paid extra.Book elsewhere
40,Had a bad experience with a host. Host Brunner was less than accommodating. One of the Kiosks was out of paper. We tried printing vouchers. Host said your husband needs to take more initiative to find a floor manager. We felt humiliated.
10,I came to Vegas for a romantic birthday getaway and woke up to the water not working.. at that time I had to be moved to another room so I missed my reservations that was set for the morning .. front desk offered me 35.00 in room credit and late checkout.. well when I returned to the new room to do homework the WiFi was awful the air didn‚Äôt work and the tub took forever to fill up so again my romantic night was ruined üò°üò°
10,Caesars Palace is beautiful. However for being an upscale venue they certainly nickel-and-dime you for everything. For example the pod of coffee for the coffee maker inside your room is $5. The hotel staff at the reservation desk is incredibly rude and unfriendly. The Highlight was at checkout when concierge showed us the mini bar bill and when I explained that we took nothing from the mini bar he said that all the items had been removed from the mini fridge. I explained that we removed the items to hold our leftovers but returned all the items to the mini bar. She then told me that the mini bar is not for personal use and they charge $75 if you use it. Seriously. I calmly replied to her that we would not be paying that as no one explained that to us upon arrival.
10,Don't stay here if you want clean rooms I came in to a dried urine toilet seat Unvacummed room . I gave them the benefit of the doubt an thought maybe they hadn't come to my room. Its was 4:30pm. I leave get back at 11pm an nothing. I stayed from Monday to Thursday an not once did housekeeping come . I called 3 times an each time I was told they'd come and mind you I had no towels unless I called I asked for towels to be picked up an nope!! Clean towels were thrown outside! Save your money resort fees are alot an you don't even get housekeeping!! Never again will I stay here.
10,Our trip was booked over a month in anticipation. We were celebrating a birthday (50th). When we arrived there after traveling for more than 10 hours there were no rooms. They over sold rooms and apparently they do that very often.
30,Just stayed overnight on my way to another destination. Arrived late and the line to check in was fairly long (11pm) but the staff were very nice. Kiosks for ‚Äúquick check-in and out‚Äù were non operable. Fairly good walk to my ‚Äútower‚Äù past many closed restaurants. There are signs everywhere to direct you to call for pick up and delivery for food but they all close by 10-11pm. The only place to get hot food was the Americano which had a substantial line and a substantial price for rather unsubstantial food. The guy taking our order should get a raise for his patience. He was very pleasant. The room was spacious clean and had a very nice bathroom. I was very comfortable and felt very safe. Casino as expected. Checkout was ditto of check in. Signage to direct me to taxis was poor but ok. It seems like a very nice hotel but chaotic and not very efficient. Please take my comments with a grain of salt since I was just passing through. The people around me seemed like they were really enjoying themselves and I realize that is what Las Vegas is all about!
20,If a face lift is possible for this place a total body make over is well overdue but may be too late! From the dim  out dated gaudy light fixtures that look like hand me downs from a B gangster movies in the forties  to the lame interior decor resembling left over movie set auction left overs the dismal energy emanating from this cave like enclosure looks like and feels like zombie hell.
30,Carpet in the room had some cutsframe on doorway was damaged.Big window looking into the strip was dirty.minibar setup was setup so bad.Door handles inside bathroom were dirty.I was expecting more for this Casino Food court was a joke only a few restaurants were open. Checking in was very slow.
40,If you're going to do Vegas I must recommend choosing a resort like Caesar's Palace. It is epic visually stunning and comfortable. The staff was extremely helpful throughout the duration of our stay when we needed help with room keys. Of course being in Vegas nothing is cheap but I felt like we got an appropriate value. The location of the resort is great also because it's basically in the center of the Strip. We didn't gamble much but the places to do so are clean and well-staffed. On-site food was delicious. If we come back to Vegas we'd consider staying again.
20,My two sisters and brother and I travel to Las Vegas for a family funeral. We chose Caesars palace due to his reputation and I belong to the club. We were extremely disappointed. Our room was beautiful and we had a nice view but there was no place to eat. I‚Äôm 80 years old and due to knee surgery I am using a cane and my sister uses a walker. We had to go to the other side of the strip to look for meals to eat. We should‚Äôve been notified that you only have most of your restaurants open on weekends. You except reservations for rooms to full capacity lines all over the place to register and yet you cannot open your restaurants. When we arrived we had lunch at the caf√© America which was our only choice. Two out of the four meals we‚Äôre an edible. Eggs bacon and dried potatoes with no toast $25. Your prices are outrageous. You had no other restaurants for us to go to dinner. So we had to limp our way up escalators across the bridge over the strip down escalators up elevator and over another crossing over another street to try to find someplace to eat. You charge a resort fee of $45 per room. What did we get for this. I did not even use your Wi-Fi service. I wanted to look at the swimming pool and I was told I had to sign up and the people in line told me that they had waited from 4 to 5 hours to be able to go into the pool. When you get notified that you can use the pool you have 15 minutes to get there otherwise your appointment is canceled per the email sent to me. Even without my cane my room is more than 15 minutes to get to the pool. All I wanted to do was look out the window and see the pool and she told me I could not. I called today to request my resort fee be refunded due to your lack of services. I was told they will never do that. And I should‚Äôve read Cesar palace his rules. I said no when I made my reservations it should‚Äôve stated that you were restaurants are closed during the week. I have traveled all over the world and I have never written on TripAdvisor to complain about some thing. We were under enough stress as it was but they have four adults age range 64 to 80 years old all of the slim and we had to find another hotel to eat in who
20,Stayed 03/28/21-04/02/21 at the time of the review still at hotel.    Well the good. Hotel cleanliness seemed to be great on the casino floor as far as looks. However didn‚Äôt see one employee clean the slot machines maybe due to them being highly busy Idk it was our 3rd visit to Vegas during covid and would see other hotels clean their slot machines often. My wife and I were married in Vegas but probably our worst trip. Drink service seemed to be ok much better at Paris which we stayed at a few months prior. Housekeeping was non existent we were told after day 3 that they do not do housekeeping at the hotel because of covid but they do send someone to your room daily to restock the mini fridge my wife took a WhiteClaw and they were on it next day replaced....lol. So covid entry is not a issue if you gain entry to go through the fridge and replace used cups. But I‚Äôve stayed at Treasure Island and Paris both had housekeeping and both during covid. So very disappointed in that part of the trip when you expect finer quality at a 4-5 star resort I‚Äôd rate it closer to a 2.5-3 star resort. Also be careful of the flooring if you stay there my wife slipped going down the hallway due to the tile not being dry from the pool area and fell she twisted her ankle a little I did report it to a staff member but she seemed like there was nothing she could do she recommended we stand in line at the front desk my wife didn‚Äôt want to waste our time in line just to tell them they had a safety issue that they should‚Äôve been fully aware of. Plus when you report a safety issue to any employee the first response should be let me contact my manager not go somewhere else with your issue. Food quality at restaurant was great and the service staff there seemed to enjoy their jobs and take pleasure in their work. Overall great hotel to visit but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend staying there from our experience. Much better options elsewhere.
30,Experienced water temperature issues our first night there and next days to come it wasn‚Äôt any better to be honest. I wouldn‚Äôt stay again I‚Äôd rather stay at other Cesar properties. Overall for the price you pay isn‚Äôt worth it
30,Unhelpful staff not just one staff member several. I asked about the pool and they could not tell me where one of the seven pools were located. The pool was only open from 10am-4pm!! Every food/beverage was extremely over priced. Didn‚Äôt even get complimentary coffee. The deadbolt was broke in my room barely any towels. No prices on mini bar/fridge.
40,Caesar's Palace Las Vegas is a nice combination of things both new and classic. Over the years they've done a nice job of adding casino floor space new rooms/towers a new/revamped lobby all the while maintaining a familiar feel. The rooms in the Augustus tower are nice though a swivel TV mount would be a huge help in being able to take advantage of the sitting/couch space. Plenty of places to eat and drink (though not all will earn you Tier/Rewards credits which is a hassle of a maze). I did find getting a cup of coffee at 4 a.m. pretty much impossible unless I wanted to get in a long line in front of Cafe Americano (which I didn't). I would both recommend and stay at again.
20,We recently spent 3 days and 2 nights at Caesars Las Vegas. The upgraded room we had was spacious and clean and a partial view off the pool which was nice. But then noticed pretty quickly that there was a coffee machine with no coffee. After asking the maid apparently that doesn't come with the hotel stay you have to pay for the mini bar for coffee. What? Coffee lines at the Starbucks were long each morning and I've never stayed at a hotel without coffee provided. Everything seemed to have a extra cost: Checking in before 4pm a chair at the pool (which we couldn't even use because there was no room for us at the pool) even though we already paid a resort fee charge to get a seat at the sports bar (most if not all) coffee etc. They didn't set up my room key card correctly so I got stuck in the parking garage and the intercom didn't work so I had to rummage around for my ticket and pay to get out even though it was supposed to be free with my room. Most things seemed to be either difficult to do or extra cost not at all the relaxing and entertaining weekend I had expected for the high price I paid for the room. It was even difficult to get help and answers from the front desk on hold for too long and then having to wait in line to ask questions and no one asked how my stay was which is usual when checking out or going up to the front desk to get information.
30,I was not impressed with the service with every employee we interacted with there. Employees were rude and rolled their eyes. Just acted like we were wasting their time if we had questions that didn't come with $$ to them. The hotel could use renovations. For the price it wasn't worth it
10,Our room was gross hadn‚Äôt been dusted in what seemed like monthsdried wax on the floors and furniture ‚Äúlove‚Äù stains on the couch and curtains. The garbages were not even emptied. Not enough towels for 3 people (even after asking for more). And 20+ minute waits for elevators. Not to mention mask reinforcement was none.
50,Eric was great. We had just arrived for my birthday to spend a week here. I love Caesars Palace. But initially I was given the wrong room number so imagine my frustration of getting to the room & the key didn‚Äôt work. That‚Äôs when I went back downstairs and met Eric. He corrected the issue & informed us about our rewards during our stay. We got into our room in time to change for dinner because of Eric
30,We first had a suite in one of the old towers. Big mistake. There were rips in the carpet and chips in the floor of our suite. Definitely what we expected for such a high price we paid for the room. Then my brother showed up with an adjoining room to our suite. There was a dirty black sock and a penny left on the floor in his room. I expect a lot more from Cesars Palace. Especially during COVID19. That‚Äôs when I lost it and went downstairs to complain. I‚Äôm 45 years old been to Vegas about 50 times al least and have never experienced this. The manager was great. He got us another suite in a new tower. Well not clean either. The microwave looked like someone cooked a plate of spaghetti uncovered for about 30 minutes. I took pictures of everything on my phone. I‚Äôm very disappointed in Cesars Palace......
40,There was a bit of a line but checking in early was easy and the desk clerk was very friendly and helped us get our rooms close together. We stayed in a Palace premium studio. The room was spacious clean and very comfortable. The dual shower heads and jetted tub were really nice. Housekeeping was great as well.    Be very aware tho not to pull anything out of the mini bar even to look at because they will charge a hefty $75 restocking fee even if no products were used. It would be very helpful if management would keep the mini bar locked and/or have a clear sign not to touch anything or pay the price. I had to spend an hour on the phone w it's customer service trying to get it figured out. It may not seem like a lot of money to some but when you spend a good amount for a nice room it was a big disappointment to be hit with a charge for something that wasn't even used. For that I can't give it five stars.
30,The hotel is nice except too many things were closed or at reduced capacity due to Covid. Hell's Kitchen Restaurant was awesome and the food was excellent. The only issue with the hotel I had was with them charging for coffee in the room. Really? $20 for a few K-cups to use in the room after spending all that money for the room plus resort fees? Ridiculous. So instead of paying $20 for coffee in the room I decided to go down to the Starbucks in the food court. I guess everyone else had the same idea because the line was literally 500 feet long wrapping all around the casino. I wasn't going to wait an hour for a cup of coffee which is usually free in your room at most hotels including Motel6. So we checked out and left noticing on the way out there were only a few places to eat in the hotel and they all had lines wrapped around the casino. There were plenty of restaurants away from the strip with no wait time.
50,We stayed here Jan. 2020. I have been to Vegas few times but so far this is my favourite hotel.  The room was very clean and spacious we stayed in one of their suites. The location was perfect. I highly recommend it.
40,The hotel is beautiful! The location is perfect! Fantastic restaurants inside the hotel as well. My only issue was that the phone in the room was not working properly. The handset did not work. Every time we attempted to call the guest services the line was busy. The room service option also did not work. So if we needed anything we had to go downstairs and speak with a staff member. But all of the staff were really nice and professional.
10,The room has hairs in the shower we called and asked for another room they answered in a rude manner because we had a tour to Grand Canyon and they don‚Äôt want to wait until we come back but it wasn‚Äôt our fault the room was dirty. In this pandemic time you expect extra cleaning and from a hotel like this you expect more. They gave us another room where the shower was so hard to turn on. Very disappointed
20,It was way overpriced the pool sucked service was poor the rooms was dirty outdated they was very rude I'll never stay there again they didn't offer any information there staff was not knowledgeable it sucked
50,The shops run for ever. It is really huge. Lots of food at the food court.Ate at Taco and it was expensive and please fill the bowl. I was still hungry and had to order chips and salsa. Only decent priced thing. My wife got a vegetarian burrito and I got the carne asada bowl. Tasted all right but please fill the bowl!
50,My husband and I just returned from Caesar‚Äôs Palace Las Vegas! Diamond Registration Desk was efficient. Shout out to Jay and to Princess! Wonderful employees and very kind and polite! Also a big thank you to Patrick Stewart a Caesar‚Äôs Host for his kindness and help with my bill.  And I must mention my incredible host Jesse Lybbert! He always makes sure my trips to Vegas are stress free and goes the extra mile to make these getaways perfect!  Caesar‚Äôs Palace continues to be an outstanding Las Vegas resort because of the employees I have mentioned!  Keep up the great work and we will see ya again soon!
30,I will start with saying I love vegas and have stayed there many times. Specifically the strip. The convenience alone is worth paying higher prices for hotels. Check-in at Caesars was easy the room was moderately clean. They claim to leave the room empty for 24 hours and sanitize everything buuuuttt you can tell not everything had been wiped clean. The bed was clean and very comfortable. Caesars is doing some construction so waking up the next day was def inconvenience. I am not a morning person so the last thing I want to be woken up to is drilling above my room. Overall it is an amazing casino to tour and stay at. But they can work on their cleaning for sure.
30,I stayed at Caesars for 3 nights and the room I got was not cleaned as well as I would expect in the time of Covid. I had a pencil fall off of the night stand and when I reached under the night stand to pick it up I ended up touching a sock that had been there who knows how long. Then in the closet there was some sort of garment that was left behind by some one and the amount of dust around it it had been there a while.
10,Rudest employees I've ever encountered in any service industry. Even above rude.....mean. I encountered three employees within an hour and two out of the three treated me worse than I've ever been treated by any person in the service industry. I'm 48 years old and traveled extensively and this was the single worst experience of my life on vacation.
30,I came with a friend and we had a 2 queen bed room in the Octavius tower. It was a pretty room. I usually use toiletries the hotel provides to save on packing space and they only have bar soap and body lotion. I had an incredibly hard time sleeping as well- it seemed as though our A/C wasn‚Äôt really working and the room was super stuffy. Additionally the elevators were repeatedly broken which seems like a bit of a liability with a bunch of people partying in Vegas and hiking up 20 flights of stairs. The hotel itself was kind of boring- other hotels had some live music and such going on- Caesars didn‚Äôt offer any of that. To use the pool we had to reserve a space a day ahead just to enter. I get it‚Äôs all because we are in a pandemic but a heads up at check in would have been appreciated. Overall my first trip to Vegas was very.... mediocre?
40,Service was excellent. Room was excellent. Casino could of been cleaner or at least have wipes available to wipe machines down . Not all food court restaurants were open. Excellent service by desk workers. All employees provided excellent service.
50,Went for our 10yr anniversary and from the moment we arrived we couldn‚Äôt believe the service that was provided even though the COVID pandemic staff was friendly helpful and accommodating which we never had to leave!
10,The room type given to us by the counter staff on the first day was different from the one booked. The quality of the room was very poor and did not inform us in advance. It was a deceit! Until we found out by ourselves we had to go to the counter again and line up again wasting a lot of our time and ruining our short vacation.
30,So we get into the room after check in. The room was great; however the there was hair all in the shower. We went to the pool and were treated like crap by Preston. We were told prior by another employee that we need to wear our masks around our ears so we complied. Then here comes Preston a little while later. We were drinking our drinks we ordered from the bar. Preston passes up several people who were not wearing masks were not drink or smoking. Preston said nothing to they. Preston told my wife and I who are drinking that we need to put our masks on. I informed Preston we were told by an employee that as long as we were drinking we had to have them around our ears. Preston told us that we needed to put our masks on after each drink. I told Preston if that is the case to refund me my money and I will keep my mask on the whole time we were at the pool. Preston said he was going to talk to his supervisor about the refund and left. As he walked away he did not say anything to anybody around me about them putting their masks on. Preston came back a little while later and stated his manager said they dont do refunds and if I don't like the mask policy we could leave. We informed Preston that we did not have a problem with the mask policy and that we were doing as he told us by putting our masks on after each drink. I informed Preston that I did have a problem with another employee telling me that I could do one thing and him telling me something completely different. I further explained to Preston why did he pass up numerous people without masks to come tell me and my wife something. I asked Preston if he was singling us out. He stated no. So I asked him what is the difference between me having my mask down drinking and pointed out all of the other people with their masks completely off with or without drinks. I also asked him what was the difference between someone sitting on the edge of the pool without a mask and me sitting on the chair without my mask drinking. Preston got upset and stormed off. I continued to follow The rules of Preston with taking a drink and putting my mask on. Preston passed by numerous times and he rarely would tell anyone else about wearing there masks.  This was my 30th wedding anniversary trip. My wife has always wanted to stay at Caesars Palace so I booked this trip since our Mediterranean cruise was canceled. This was the first time staying here and it will be our last. This is our 4th trip to vegas since COVID.
50,I really loved the room that I had because the room was so beautiful. I didn't like the fact that the room I was in didn't have a refrigerator in it. The room only had the drink refrigerator that you had to pay for to drink. I was very disappointed because your videos show the rooms with a refrigerator.
10,Last time we sayed at caesers palace was nice - not anymore... The room was ok which we upgraded they charged us a resort fee but we couldn't use any amenities because of covid. Rude customer service (didn't care about our needs) bad communication. Low-end circus circus -like crowd. Will not stay there again.
50,Eric at the front desk at Diamond registration was very helpful polite professional and patient. The line was super long and i know it gets stressful since I worked in Hospitality. I was there for one night and he put me on Octavius room (one of my favorite rooms). Room was spacious pool view and clean. The beds are very comfy!
10,Visited for 3 nights the week of March 15th. Room got cleaned the first night. The second night it didn‚Äôt get cleaned. Was told that it was because of Covid. Also was told the house cleaning manager would call me. Never did. Asked two different staff members for clean towels. Just like the promised phone call towels were missing in action. Not the level of service one expects from Caesars.
10,The security was very anal about the 6 foot spacing in lines but everyone is shoulder to shoulder throughout the casino. No distancing there. Clerks were very picky about masks over the nose too but you could walk anywhere with it hanging around your neck. Very inconsistent protocol policies. Extremely annoying in general. Never going back.
50,Caesar Palace great place to stay! Middle of the strip near lots of restaurants kid‚Äôs activities shopping. Had great service all week hotel was clean nice quiet room with view of fountains and strip. Been to 4 different resorts so far and Caesar Palace is the best!
50,200 characters is not enough to express my gratitude for Team Member Mehvet (at the registration desk). She was an amazing help with my mom's reservations. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALL YOUR HELP!! God Bless
20,Checked in on tues AM  by wed room not cleaned. Called front desk was told need to request service. By thurs still no cleaning. called was told will be cleaned by noon. By 5 pm  still no cleaning. After calling Again was told they will remove 1 day Resort fee ($50) Checked out on friday  no clean room yet and no fee removed. Called desk was on hold for 25 min  then they hung up. Also if you order a Large mix/slush drink expect to pay $30. You can be in the pool with 50 people without a mask but if your in the corner on a chair (by no one) to sun Must have mask. Overall Not what We expected from a Top Hotel.
30,I always wonder what it feels like staying here. Tried other hotels along the strip but this one was kinda disappointing. The room we booked is way to far from the rest of the casino side. We found chips left overs inside the drawer of the nightstand. We cannot find the TV remote & when called to request for one it took them 1.5hrs to bring it over. I know I got a good price for this hotel but hey $200 a night ain't cheap plus resort fee and parking. The bathroom drawers are falling apart & needs future renovations. I expected more since this hotel looks like first class to me. Lastly you can hear your neighbors closing doors in the middle of the night while you sleep.
50,I visit Vegas often and have stayed at many properties. Caesars Palace was by far one of my favorite places. The staff was attentive and kind. The pool is heated so the water feels nice. The rooms was very nice. Great location center strip. The crowd there was mostly middle class to upper middle class. Not a trashy crowd at all which can be somewhat common at some Vegas properties. I had an amazing time and I believe anyone who stays here will too.
50,When I saw the room online I was in awe but when I actually stepped foot in it it was amazing and the view was beautiful as it overlooked the pool area. The bed was so soft it makes a long day relaxing.
30,The hotel was nice. Did have multiple problems with our room key not working as well as the jets in the tub and the clock in the room. Front desk was nice. Also had maid service come into our room while we were sleeping. Do not disturb light was on and hanging on the door
30,Aside from being incredibly large and at times exhausting hotel to navigate Caesar's Palace is really an incredible strip hotel. Our Augustus strip view room was beautiful and the staff very courteous and attentive. Unfortunately I cannot say the same about employee Anaya at the Starbucks in the forum food court. She has been incredibly rude and unprofessional and corporate is being contacted. For that reason I cannot give 4 or 5 stars.
50,Got here early and was able to get early check in upgrade for an extra $75 which was totally worth it! The lines were very long at check in time. Nice suite overlooking the fountains & strip. Pools were open with a lot of available loungers but no drink service unless you go to the bar. Need to make reservations at restaurants as Vegas in opening back up. Need to sign up for Texas Holden tournaments early as they fill up too. We have great service from all the staff we encountered. Nice time.
10,Currently staying at Caesar palace till Friday 19th March roll on Friday been here since Monday by far worst experience in a hotel in along time service is appalling none existent in fact litterally que for everything 1 hour que to check in then when we finally did room stunk of cigarette smoke so after the long que we then had to move rooms due to the smell. They only have one bar tender serving and making drinks In the bar next to check In and casino do not expect to revive drinks when gambling as the waitress will take your order but never return with your drink I have actually complained tonight to management about the service and covid rules in place I was credited $100 to my room which is a very small  Gesture especially when I won‚Äôt get to use it as they have no staff on hand to serve drinks or take my order which was whole point of my complaint to manager. I would not recommend this hotel they blame everything and anything on covid now so I explained why re open and operate and take customers money when you can‚Äôt meet the customers needs and are over working staff that probably have no option but to work in the pandemic we are in. Shame on this hotel they have a million rules not have I seen a slot machine wiped down after use 6ft distancing is not in operation unless you get a staff member who is pissed off then decides to take out their mood on you and enforce every covid rule to make their self feel better. It‚Äôs a joke choose another hotel do not waste yr time or money on this dated hotel.
50,Service was excellent friendly helpful staff food at Hells Kitchen was to die for. Will most def stay there again. Location is right where you wanna be on the strip. Room with double shower head and spa tub were over the top
10,I normally love This hotel( see previous review) but this time was different    First issue  Check in- I checked in via the app which was supposed to be mobile- we should have only had to pick up the keys from the kiosk- well all of the machines were down and roped off.  Hour wait in the line. Not happy :(      Second issue  Parking - I was there 3/4-3/7 and not one time did the keycard work to come in and out of the garage.  We tried assist button but one of the gates were broken.  I tried to have it resolved through concierge- their suggestion was to go to front desk.  We waited an hour to check in - I will not wait another hour for my key card to work.  My boyfriend went down at like three am and asked about it. The rep DID NOT change card and told him refunds are handled through a third party. Total cost $90 which was supposed to be included in the resort fees. Upset :(    Third issue  On Saturday we got a text saying they would extend the room for free. At this time - we were going to leave Sunday.    Unfortunately Sunday we locked the keys in the rental car and had to do late check out which was an additional $60. Five hours later keys were out of car. By this time we had missed our flight so we had to stay another night. I again texted the concierge and they said the free offer was not for the same type of room... 24 hours ago it was and the hotel for sure is not packed on a Sunday night. Done :( :(:(    We packed up and moved over to Bellagio.  Mobile check in/out. No lines no contact free parking.  Caesars palace is not worth the headache.
20,We travel to Vegas often and always stay at Caesar's Resorts as Total Rewards members and we were so disappointed after our last stay. I have never written a review before but feel it is necessary. We stood in check in line for over an hour (at 5pm after check-in time) then were told that our room was not yet ready and waited another two hours. After we received our keys we walked into our room to realize that we were not given the room that we had booked which was what we were told the reason why our room was not ready. Our room was not the cleanest but we decided to move on and enjoy our trip. But then we were not able to get any sleep as the room was not soundproof at all I totally understand that it's Vegas and people will be up and about all hours of the night but have never had a room where I could hear the people in the room next to us speaking at a normal voice level.    We then got our flight cancelled due to weather so we asked to extend our stay and were told to speak to the Casino Host. I have never been spoken to so condescendingly by anyone in the hospitality industry as I did that day by the front desk and casino host. Overall there was just one thing after another on this trip and we had the worst experience we have ever had visiting a Caesars Resort and it is hard to say if we will return. There are SO many wonderful options in Vegas I would recommend booking another hotel.
50,Our stay here was fabulous! Everything was clean and the staff was amazing. Daniel N at check in made us feel so comfortable. He went above and beyond to help us extend our stay and ensured we got the exact room with a view that we wanted! Overall great trip. If you have never been to LV I highly recommend staying here for a fun clean and safe experience!
50,Our stay was absolutely incredible. The only negative was the food court. We really wanted some sandwiches and noodles but other than that we have no complaints about our stay. We will be coming back again in the near future.
10,Upon Checking in the Front desk Representative told me he was giving me an upgrade from my King room to a King Suite with a view. When we got to the room it turned out to be a dirty room. I asked them to send me keys to a new clean room and I was told that I needed to go back down and go through the line process all over again for another 25-minute wait. When I received the new room I was told that I would not be getting the upgraded King Suite but a Premium King room which was smaller now this room had several maintenance issues and housekeeping. I feel like Caesars has lost it touch for customer service and the property is going the wrong way. They need to focus on the guest satisfaction and the property upkeep. This room was in the Augusta Tower RM 3888.
10,I‚Äôm not sure where to begin. My wife and I booked with Caesar‚Äôs palace because we had to cancel our wedding due to covid so we figured we would book a nice hotel for a honeymoon Caesar‚Äôs has always been our dream hotel to stay on  on the strip. We checked in got to our room and automatically noticed hand indentations on the wall above the bed we let it go we figured we wouldn‚Äôt let that ruin our stay. Then when we got ON the bed it was SO LOUD horribly loud. We also let it go. But then the next day we went to lay down again and we saw black bugs all over our bed. We were in disgust. We called down and they told us to come down so we could get a new room. . So we did we got an ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù room  but when we got to our new room our neighbors were EXTREMELY loud there were at least 15 people in the room next door keep in mind we had a 3 am flight so needed to get some sort of sleep. We called down and pleaded for a different room EVEN if it wasn‚Äôt an upgrade we didn‚Äôt care we just wanted somewhere to sleep. They told us they couldn‚Äôt help us. Overall it was NOT a good experience. The staff seemed to not care about anything we mentioned not to mention they seemed annoyed we were even complaining. I know it‚Äôs Vegas and it‚Äôs party city but we just wanted a different room we didn‚Äôt care about the elegance or upgrade of the room. It was not a good experience and for that reason I would not recommend . We had a better experience staying at treasure island last time we stayed in Vegas than staying here at Caesar‚Äôs which was disappointing considering we were so excited.
40,I came to Vegas to celebrate my husband‚Äôs 50 birthday and my daughter‚Äùs 21 birthday. The hotel is beautiful and clean. The room was clean and the only issues i had was with the pillows on the bed and the elevators. The pillows was a little hard and a couple of the elevators broke down while i was there. I was located on the 63rd floor and their was a long line to get on the elevators that were working. Other than that we had a great time at Caesars.
50,Customer service was great. Atmosphere was very fun. Will definitely come back again. First time ever going to a casino in Las Vegas so I didn‚Äôt know what to expect. We created great memories and made new friends.
50,Moses at front desk was extremely nice and helpful. Room was very clean and the bellhop was helpful as well but we didn‚Äôt get his name. Everything met our expectations. The bed is comfortable. And the service was very fast.
10,Horrible trip to Vegas. Came July 2020 and things were much better this time not so much. This review will only address the horrid pool policy. First the hotel has social distanced all chairs..which is good. But they‚Äôve mandated a mask policy at all times while laying out at the pool. Even though you are outside and at least 10 feet from all other visitors you are required to wear a mask unless you are actively eating or drinking. In fact the moment you take off your mask the lifeguard is quick to come over and tell you to put it back on. To recap outdoors nobody around and they force you to get a mask tan line. Absurd!
30,I've been to Vegas dozens of times and I've recently been trying out Caesars properties but never the Caesars Palace itself.    CHECK IN  Check in from the line to the front desk was a 15 min wait with someone standing by asking if you had any covid symptoms.  Upon checking in the front desk Attendant though he wasn't rude was kind of snarky when telling me about the petite sweet I booked. I get it you're trying to upsell me on an upgraded room for $70 extra per night. But telling me the room i got has a bad view isn't a good at all and I should definitely upgrade unless I want to stare at a wall kind of rubbed me the wrong way. Im a tired healthcare just looking for a week getaway didn't need that bit of attitude to be honest.    THE ROOM  I arrived to my room in the forum tower petite suite. Upon entering I was blown away at the size of the room. The bed was huge the bathroom even bigger with a tub and long shower with a bench seat and rainfall shower head. After initially entering I dropped my stuff off and went to buy water. I came back and turned more lights on noticed quite a few stains on the couches dirty carpet water on the sink tops And towels that looked to have been just thrown. The one thing that surprised me was there was not one bar of hand soap in the whole suite. I did call guest services and was told to go down to the front with all my belongings.    I proceeded to do so and was told I'd been moved to a room in the Julius tower(I believe) the room although was alot more updated seemed just a bit smaller definitely had a smaller bathroom no tub no rain shower head nor bench. The view was of the parking garage and mountains in the distance. I did appreciate that the room was cleaner and yes it had hand soap.    CASINO  always a fun environment plenty of table games the slots had alot of options though not some of the more popular ones. This casino was definitely not good to me but thats probably 90% of us.    FOOD  I went midweek and found that most on site food options were closed some only open on weekends. The food court had a few options but only starbucks smashbuger and a pizza place seemed to be open. I ended up going to the forum shoppes for food most days.    CHECKOUT  this was an easy process I did this through my TV remote. It was an instant process and was then emailed a receipt.    PROS:  Its historic Caesars Palace  Check in/out was easy(despite the Attendant)  Location is near mid strip  Suites are larger than most    CONS  Resort fee is one of the highest on the strip  Stores for basic needs (drinks/snacks) have outrageous prices. Paid $27 for 3 bottles of water 32oz  Cleanliness(could have just gone on a bad day)  Its easy to get lost looking for your room tower.    Overall I would stay here again and likely will given I find a good deal on it. As things start to open up more I feel Caesars will just get better.
10,We stayed at this hotel because it came recommended to us and I was asked to evaluate it for major upcoming events. I liked how clean the rooms were and the double-door walk in shower/jetted tub were awesome; but that was where it ended. There were several lights in our room burnt out. After several calls for service they finally came on the last day and changed all of the lightbulbs out. There were no signs indicating that snacks/drinks (just left out on the counter....) had a cost. I called down to the front desk and was told it was complimentary since I am a current Queen.I had 2 waters 1 soda 1 candy 1 mini Pringles over the 3 days. Our room keys worked at check-in/the first day after that every time we left the room we had to stop by the front desk for new room keys (there is always a long line of people checking in/out but you have to go to the front desk to get a replacement room key no exceptions). On the 4th day I went to the front desk for a new key was denied & told that my friends had racked up a $660 bill between the snacks I ate in the room and a poolside bar bill. They LOCKED us out of our room that we already paid for over this! I paid it got back in the room reviewed the bill and found several inflated charges that I later had a manager correct along with several bar charges that were not even ours. This was a horrible experience and I absolutely will not stay here or recommend this hotel for its terrible customer service and lack of basic decency!
30,I always wanted to stay here well not so much anymore. The staff was amazing but that‚Äôs about as far as I can go. The room was average maybe a little below for what you pay. Food options were very tough to come by and well overpriced. It was literally a little over a half mile walk from the self park to the lobby. It took 30 minutes to walk from the self park to the front desk then to our room. This place is just too big for me you have to walk forever to get anywhere. They also have a lot of construction going on at the moment.
10,We have had such a frustrating time with the front desk I never anticipate returning here. We checked in yesterday and used valet because we couldn't figure out check in parking. No big deal but the desk told us (after a 30 - 45 minute check in wait in line) if we went back to valet there would be no charge because we were checking in. So we did that but valet disagreed with the information we were given by the desk. We left the car in valet and pulled it this morning to use self park which we prefer. Only problem the room key was not coded to allow us to park. So you call on the machine and eventually someone answers and lets you in. Then back to the front desk and its standard wait for 30 + minutes to get the room key so we can get our car in and out of self park. Deep breath we are all set now.  Nope. We have family arriving today and we purchased early check in for them. While my husband was gambling I went to get their room. Again a 30 - 45 minute wait to speak to someone. While waiting an employee suggested I use the kiosk. I showed her on the early check in confirmation that it said we must check in  at the desk. She told me she didn't know who sent that (never mind that it is an official email from Caesars Palace) but I could use the kiosk. I stuck to the line. Eventually I got thru but my name is not on the reservation and even with all the documentation available and the same last name same address on DL I cannot check our family in. So I must go find my husband in the casino and send him to do the early check in.  Once he was finished with that ordeal the keys. In the process his key to our room  was he thought mixed up with the keys for the other room. I went to sort our the keys and it appears all keys were keyed to the other room. So now I look forward to heading back down to the good ole front desk and getting him a key to our room. Actually I probably can't do it he will need to stop gambling and get it.  My husband enjoys gambling and we used to come here frequently. It has been a while and I am beyond disappointed in all the hassle we have been put thru. Most definitely not what we came here for.
10,We stayed in the ‚Äúpremium‚Äù Augustus Tower. The carpet is old the upholstery on the chairs was filthy all the furniture is old and beat up. The room wasn‚Äôt really clean. Caesars should be ashamed to consider this a premium room. Not much better than The Rio. I‚Äôll never stay there again. The ONLY good thing was Sam the bellman! He is awesome!
20,The hotel was very clean and located well. The customer service was not even sub par. As a guest you felt as if you were there for the employees and not the other way around. Not one hotel employee seemed excited or even remotely happy that customers were there more like an inconvenience. While on our trip we went to most of the casinos on the strip and were successful in winning at every casino but Ceasers also the player rewards were not anything to entice you to want to continue to play there let alone make it even worth the wait to get a players card. We will be back to Las Vegas but will not stay at Ceasers Palace again.
50,I was checking in and I wanted to change my room and Salvatore was great ! He was so nice and personable . Very nice and pleasant person . Thanks Salvatore !He has awesome customer service skills . And the room I‚Äôm in is great  the palace studio king room very nice .
10,I was staying on the 7th floor of Julius Towers room 766 the carpet in the room was burned by cigarettes and dirty as well as the armchair as a safe it did not close and there was no engineer at night and I had to speak to the other again day for the engineer to turn me on. the Romo looked like a super 8 hotel. I have pics the room  estuve alojado en el 7th piso de julius towers room 766 la alfombra de la habitacion estaba quemada por cigarillos y sucia como asi tambien el sillon como caja fuerte no cerraba y no habia ingeniero a la noche y tuve que volver hablar al otro dia par que me encien el ingeniero. la habitacion parecia a la de un super 8 hotel. Tengo fotos de c√≥mo estaba la habitaci√≥n
50,Eric Wages was exceptional in his kindness competence and knowledge. He was very helpful and did not convey that he was touting the company line. He wa s by far the best we have ever had. We had stayed the previous two nights at the Nobu Hotel and where glad to be back at Ceasars!!!
20,So the express check in took 30 minutes of waiting in line to be told my room wasn't ready at 5pm. The guy was apparently able to make a room magically appear when asked trying to check in. There was hair on the top and toilet seat and several on the top not to mention a prescription left behind by a prior guest that I found. I have a hard time believing these rooms are being cleaned with any real attention to detail. Beautiful view but not sure the rooms are adequately cleaned.
40,Hi  Was here back in 2007 Cousin wedding staying here 4-6Day room was deluxe another breakfast is up to 1000PM Restaurant is 1100PM full service 24Hrs7day aweek with Room service some was staying because there enjoy the staying some went ahead because of the job meeting my back in Fresno lot of homework to do to next semester distinguished assignment
50,Awesome location in the middle of the strip.Fun place for gaming with different denominations within one‚Äôs budget.  Choices of restaurants with great food and service.  Vanderpump Garden excellent for group of friends to hangout and have drinks and small snacks
10,We stayed here for 4 nights. Everything was okay until the last day. Around 3pm on the last day the hotel maid just unlocked our door and walks right in. No knocking no warning nothing.    Due to COVID we specifically requested no one come in our room and we didn‚Äôt want maid service during our stay. So in was very odd that she just walked in (perhaps she wanted to go through our things and thought we were out). We could have been undressed and without warning she‚Äôs just in our room and with all the other rooms she had been to that day who knows if she had been to a room with someone with COVID.    After she came in and saw that we were there she started to leave and I said please knock next time and her reply was ‚Äúokay whatever‚Äù. This whole thing was so unprofessional and after that experience we do not feel safe staying there and we do not feel our things our safe being left in our hotel room.    We pay a little more money to stay here to get better quality service but we definitely didn‚Äôt get it.
50,Checked in on a Sunday in the VIP Check in. Abbey was so patient with my friend‚Äôs questions. She was kind and funny too. She seemed very comfortable with the whole process. She was thorough about the suite view pool hours and where to eat. Abbey made it all smooth!! Thank you Abbey!!
50,Caesars has been around but needs to update their internet!! The strip is going 5G and yet CP continues to have a very archaic internet. When will this ever get fixed?? I‚Äôm here every month and the same problem continues. Change your ISP if they can not give guests this service.
10,Where do I start okay let‚Äôs start with I am in business management for dentistry. And my wife is a PA-C I would say we are pretty away of precautions for covid 19.  They aren‚Äôt accommodating their guest AT ALL. This is one of the only hotels still charging resort fees on the strip. But that‚Äôs not the worst part there is no buffets in ANY HOTEL. I Think that‚Äôs a Nevada thing. But Caesar‚Äôs decided to go ahead and cancel the room service as well due to the ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù. You would think that they would encourage their guests to stay in their rooms for dining and offer not only room service but maybe more or specials or extras to encourage social distancing. If you don‚Äôt have credit card (not debit card) you can‚Äôt get food from the Hotel Restaurant delivered to your room AT ALL and you may as well plan on walking a mile for food and spending 100$. If you do have a credit card they charge you 13.99 for the delivery in BOXES WITH PLASTIC SILVERWARE. And yes it‚Äôs still 30$ per plate and the delivery etc. The lunch options for delivery are a 76$ pizza or you can order from the Gordon Ramsay pub. But if your gluten free you‚Äôre pretty much going to starve. There is ZERO ACCOMMODATIONS! They would have people out searching for food. If you go to the ‚Äúconvenience stores‚Äù inside for a water bottle it‚Äôs 9$ So you can assume how much a bag of chips costs and at that point you‚Äôre so HUNGRY you‚Äôre paying 45$ for chips and cereal for breakfast on your romantic trip?! That‚Äôs something to wake up too and if you use the KEURIG and and make your own coffee it‚Äôs a room service charge of 22$‚Äî I feel like it‚Äôs so mediocre. Covid 19 has been around for a year and they haven‚Äôt figured it out yet?    Not only are the prices RIDICULOUS. I called the front desk to see what I could do to get some food to my room and the person in customer service hung up on me. I requested a band aid and they said they would bring me one and never did. Then they instructed me to walk down to the store AND BUY ONE. My foot/ankle was bleeding pretty bad. Like I would get blood everywhere. I was appalled that they really just don‚Äôt care at all about the people paying a lot of money to stay there. The hotel is nice and well kept but the cigarette smoke isn‚Äôt being filtered properly. Every night sleeping in my room the air feels thick heavy and polluted. I got a cough it definitely seemed smokier than other hotels and casinos on the strip.    Basically it was my first time in Vegas and probably my last.
30,With low occupancy in Vegas as COVID recovery is in place I expected great service and extra cleaning measures. Instead they unapologetically told me they did not have the room I had reserved. In the room they substituted there were items left by the previous guest so I assume the cleaning was not great. The elevator was dirty as well. They were doing temperature checks and requiring masks but I did not observe extra cleaning measures. Keys did not work repeatedly. No electronic key option. Long lines for check in check out because they only had a couple of agents at the desk. Beautiful property but service was mediocre and disappointing.
50,Me and my girlfriend came into Caesar‚Äôs looking to join their rewards possibly to see how it is (as we are MLife members already)    I will say thanks to Ivan Valino at the Rewards Desk we are now not only members of Caesar‚Äôs rewards program but people who will be bringing most of our business here!    Fantastic service! Thank you Ivan!
50,During a short trip to Vegas my husband and myself stayed at Caesars Palace. It was a beautiful hotel and casio! Our room had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains. The casio was not very crowded a few of tables were also closed down due to COVID to social distance.. We had a wonderful time!! We did not leave as millionaires but we did not lose everything either. So I will consider that a win.
10,"We were celebrating my nieces birthday and we decided to stay at Caesars. They checked in a day ealier than I did. The desk gave them a upgrade for free. I had made reservations for 4 rooms for her and her friends. I had comp rooms for two nights and Saturday night I was charged. Upon checking in I asked for an upgrade to the Palace with my family. She said it would be a charge of $50 per night. Mind you the didn't charge my niece and her friends for an upgrade. So I went along with the The Forum. The rooms are dated and crappy looking. The dresser paint had come off from years of wear. The curtains was dirty mattresses are very soft and not firm. I had problems with the noise level that was over my head and next door had children that was making so much noise. I had to call security two times! My stay was horrible and I left a day earlier. I was that disappointed in Caesar. My first time and last time staying there. So if you are going to stay stay in ""The Palace or NUBO"" the rooms are much newer."
50,Tangela was absolutely amazing great customer service. When me and my brother checked in a little before check in time. She went above and beyond to accommodate us. I unfortunately can‚Äôt say the same thing about her  colleague that was working with her. She definitely gave us a friendly memorable experience. Thank you Tangela for you superb service.
30,Had to call for additional towels and glasses as there were only enough provided for 2 people we had 3 in our room. No coffee cups provided until the day before we left. The uber location is very inconvenient as it's such a long walk from the rooms. Sink in bathroom had a constant drip that needs to be fixed.
10,Bad customer service. Trash stayed in the room for days. Had to call for towels and bags to empty the trash in. No refrigerator most hotels have a refrigerator. The cleaning of the room was not fully explained. It seems as if they were hiding. I really like the room. Nice
50,When we checked into the Hotel Tangela is who helped us and she was a very nice and helpful person. We didnt have a room booked just yet we showed her what we were looking at getting and she advised us where it was cheaper to purchase the room and had lost of patience with us as we booked the room online.
10,"This used to be a wonderful place to stay. What happened?? Has management changed?  1. First of all ""Safety"". Never before have we had safety concerns in Las Vegas and Caesars. Now people hover in the gaming area waiting to steal your money phone etc. and run. This has happened to us and several others have told us the same story. People are also solicitating donations in the casino selling raffle tickets etc. It has become a circus.  2. Lack of staff: You wait in line for everything. Check in restaurants placing bets drink service Rewards counter etc. Laid off employees should be hired back! Drink service is non existent.  3. Majority of staff has negative attitude: Feel bad for them. Guessing on how poorly treated they were by management during the Covid crisis.  4. Bogus charges on bill: Would not delete them at check out. A day later we received a message they were a mistake and had been deleted.  5. Organization terrible: We had been using a line of credit for years. This time we were told it did not exist. Was given a new application to complete. Discussions with three people and two calls to the credit department and 45 minutes to clear up.  6. Uber location: About a 15 minute walk to the front desk. Cabs pull up front. Why not make it convenient for customers???  7. Recently at the Great Gift Wrap Up - what a disaster!!!!!  8. Few quick food choices. Two now and use to be about 7.  We are the top gambling tier (7 Star) and the lines are much longer for others."
10,HORRIBLE!!!!  will never do again neither recommend to any of residents or visitors I know of.  The worst day pass experience ever.  Rude staff around the pool make you hate your life.  you cannot find any space to sunbed and most of the seats around the pool are empty cabanas that you have to pay 1000 aed to use!    PLEASE dont be fooled by the positive reviews. it is all tourist groups that stay in the hotel for a week or so.    save yourself and pick somewhere nicer for a dayuse
10,"My husband got stuck in the elevator for over 1/2 hour and upon check out I told the attendant and he said ""Sorry to hear that here's your receipt"". I asked if they were going to do anything for this and he got his manager. They took off $108 but couldn't just give us the room for free. Still had to pay for the $9 soda pop from the fridge! No complimentary coffee in the morning either. Room had Kuerig but no pods!"
10,I visited the hotel recently for my anniversary. First they gave me a room with double beds when i requested a king. Second day somone came in our room and stole all our belongings including my left over food. I was told a manager would contact us shortly. No manager of this property called to check on us Move us to another room even for covid mesasures or just follow up. It had now been 3 days and i still havent heard from them. Only the metro police came and took a report. This hotel has gone to the pits. They have no cameras on hotel floors. Its out dated and anyone one can get on your floor. The customer service is the absolute worst. Dont be fooled by the reputation the Old Caesars use to have. S
30,The casino itself is beautiful. The parking lot was dreadful but I mean it‚Äôs a parking lot. The room was amazing and the staff was wonderful especially Mehret at check in. They were so friendly and paid extra attention to detail.
50,Ceasars Palace was very nice. Staff was nice. I liked how there was no security at the elevators as that was annoying at the venetian and aria. Room was very spacious. Bed was comfortable. Nice jetted tubs. I was in the Augustus Suite. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I didn't touch the snacks.
10,My husband and I decided to spend our birthday weekend in Vegas. Since it was just adults including our friends who are also married. We decided to stay on the strip and chose Cesar's Palace as our hotel. We checked in on 2/18/21 and immediately noticed that our upgraded room which we upgraded was not clean. There was trash underneath our bed and the room chair looked like some one and threw up all over it. I called down to the front desk and asked for someone to come up and take a look at what we saw. No one from house keeping nor the front desk came up after we waited for an hour.    My husband and I decided to go down to the front desk and complain. The Manager gave us a $50.00 credit voucher to eat at one of the restaurants in the hotel and changed our room. We checked into the next room and it was the same issue unclean and the tub was broken. At this point I am super frustrated and our birthday weekend has now been ruined. Again we call down and tell the front desk manager that this is unacceptable. We wait another 2 hours and they change our room again. This time they tell us they have a team of housekeepers cleaning the room before we enter the room.    Don't you think the room should have been cleaned prior to you checking in guests? The manager stated that due to COVID they have limited staff. That just does not sit well with me. You should be cleaning the rooms even more due to COVID.    Please be careful when booking a room at Caesars Palace and make sure your room is clean. They are turning and burning these rooms without making sure they are clean and sanitized. The stay cost us over $900.00 for check in on 2/18 and check out on 2/22 so not worth it.
20,Booked a suite. The one provided had plumbing issues. So they moved us to a more modern suite that hadn‚Äôt been used in awhile and had the same clogged sink issue. Management did not care. You‚Äôd think since traffic is low a name like Caesar‚Äôs would want to value the guests they do have but that was definitely not the case.
50,First visit in zeb wei and food was so good . No words to explain that how it was . Specially thanks to menchi and sabin service beyond expectation. Would love to see again guys . Ambiance is so nice . Next time gonna bring my friends with me .
50,First time staying at Caesars Palace had a great time. Great customer service enjoyed the casino. Found it to be in a great location in the strip could walk to other casinos and restaurants within minutes.
40,My sister and I decided to go to Vegas for our 40th birthday. We chose Caesar's because we've never stayed there before. We arrived at the hotel at 2 pm and the check in line was quite long. After temperature checks we waited about 30 and were greeted by Anthony. He was SOOOO nice. I booked the Augustus tower and mentioned I read reviews online on which room to get. We were given room 3958. The room was pretty basic but when we opened the curtains the view was SPECTACULAR. Our room faced the Bellagio fountain along with views of the strip and mountains. The room did have a few minor cosmetic issues like the carpet in the corner was coming up and the wallpaper was starting to come off of the walls but that didn't bother me. The beds were nice and comfortable and the bathroom has a jet tub. It was spacious and bright. . We actually turned the sofa around to watch the fountain. We stayed four nights and ate at Searsucker (highly recommended). We aren't diamond members or anything like that but we were treated as such. I'd highly recommend staying here!    The only reason I didn't give this hotel five stars is there was a nightly resort fee of $51.02. There was only one pool open (which as you can imagine was packed) and you can connect two devices to the room. This fee should be less because we didn't really get much out of the 'resort' due to a lot of things being closed. (And yes I know the fee is to compete with other hotels on the strip... it just seems moot especially for the amount of visitors they still receive).    As an FYI: there wasn't much enforcement for wearing masks. There were some offered at the front door and the only temperature checks were if you are checking into the hotel.
50,They have everything to offer. You never have to leave the hotel for everything. The room so clean and the service provide the was excellent. We will be back. Over 15 restaurants and a food court a mall and other international brand stores.
30,My time in Vegas with my sisters and nieces was great! My stay in Caesar‚Äôs Palace was mediocre. I just returned 03/01/2021. The costs for resort fees are high and unfair (particularly seeing many locations are waiving them because of the pandemic). Included in the resort fees are; the use of the pool-it was closed for the season local calls-none of the phones in the three rooms we had worked and other unknown hotel amenities-ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. There is a Kuerig coffee pot in the room but you have to pay $20 for the coffee and condiments. Many of the restaurants were closed. We went to the food court Smash Burger for breakfast and could not get coffee because they had no water for the coffee machine then they said they could not give us a cup of ice water because if the pandemic (which didn‚Äôt seem to be a problem for the bars that were open). The meals were overpriced and room service charge was $13! The rooms were spacious but outdated. The hall carpets leading to the rooms were very dusty and in need of vacuuming. I did love the bathroom with the large jacuzzi tub. The staff was pleasant.
50,Amazing time! Room was beautiful and clean. One lamps light bulb didn‚Äôt work but overall the experience was great! The bathroom is stunning! Stay in the palace tower you won‚Äôt regret it! Definitely will be coming back!
10,My step daughter wanted to celebrate her 30th B-Day in Vegas. Booked 3 rooms. It wasn‚Äôt until we got there that we were informed of the $51 resort fee/room/day $75 restocking fee for use of fridge even if you didn‚Äôt consume anything the 2 device minimum per room for fee WiFi. Really??? Who doesn‚Äôt offer free WiFi??? Over half the restaurants and shops closed. There were 3 open coffee shops which you had to wait in line for about 20-35 minutes just for a cup of coffee since there wasn‚Äôt coffee in the room. The pool area and spa was closed there wasn‚Äôt enough staff on the casino floor. House keeping was by request only; which we did twice and they never showed up. The elevators for our floor at the Forum Tower 2 out of 6 were operating. We had to wait in line there as well. The food and drink prices were through the roof. If you had leftovers you were screwed because you couldn‚Äôt even use the the fridge to store it because you were threatened with a $75 restocking fee. I am floored that this multi million maybe billion $ casino/corporation feels so at ease about nickel and diming their customers to death!!! Extremely disappointed!!! I won‚Äôt go back and I am a Caesars rewards member.
50,Most reviews seem to be about great hotels and restaurants but wanted to take a moment to review our recent visit simply for gaming. The Caesars staff is as strong and helpful as ever even during these Covid days. In particular I had the best service experience ever at the Total Rewards desk. An employee named Ivan Valino was stellar in every way; so much so that I felt inspired to ask for his full name as I feel as though too many stars go unrecognized. From the moment he welcomed me when it was my turn he did what only truly trained smart and seasoned service professionals do routinely. He sincerely inquired not only about how my trip was going but how he could get the most of my loyalty rewards and benefits with Caesars Rewards. I thought I already knew about what might be of interest but he actually asked some great questions to make sure I had explored all the promotions and rewards and in such a way that it made me feel the fun I used to have when first joining the rewards program several years ago. He worked quickly but at the same time seemed to not be rushing me away at the same time. The visits usually seem transactional but with Ivan it felt like a fun process. Aside from Total Rewards I noticed that the folks working the video poker area were smiling and engaging customers in a light and cheery way and that even the security guards were friendlier than ever now that they also have an active role to ensure the safety from a virus standpoint too. It was a great experience and made me feel as though Caesars best days are just starting. Will go back to play there for sure.
30,I had high expectations knowing that it is THE Cesars Palace that everyone knows is a luxury hotel. We stayed for 2 nights in a standard room although not a deluxe or suite but it should at least live up to the rest of what a luxury hotel is. Our bathroom shower and sinks were draining so slow. After every shower the suds gather at the center so I had to wait for it to drain before I wash my feet again. The room we stayed needs a lot of maintenance. The towels need replacement since they were all worn out looking like it was washed and bleached 1000x already. Hotel rooms suppose to have at least free coffee but there was nothing. Everything had a charge. Not sure if I want to stay here again.
20,"While everyone has been nice the decor of our ""suite"" in the Forum Tower is late 70s early 80s. Well the furniture may be that old. I can't say with condition that the furniture is from the same furniture set. Hotel lobby furniture looks better than this and this beat up furniture. This was our first time at Ceasars Palace and of all the Vegas hotels we stayed at this room is by far the worse."
20,One of the worst hotel rooms on the strip. Hotel and casino are truly starting to show their age. Room walls were dirty. If you get the chance to go to Vegas don‚Äôt make the mistake of staying here. Bally‚Äôs was much nicer than this.
10,Was super excited about a get away booking and paying for a jr premium suite in the Augustus Tower- only to find out that out ‚Äúpremium suite‚Äù was not available (basically they overbooked and that trumped my planned stay) after discussing politely with the front desk that we paid to be in the Augustus towers with a king sized bed- basically were told there were no other rooms and we were stuck with 2 queen sized beds for the night in a comparable room....although disappointed we agreed to the move in the morning- after being tucked away in the ‚Äúpalace‚Äù not sure why it‚Äôs called that as it‚Äôs anything but- I realized this is nothing comparable to what I purchased. I‚Äôve stayed here before gamble more than the average and enjoy great food- I and can tell you this was NOTHING like the room I booked- I will update this review after the outcome tomorrow am for tonight I am one unhappy lady who will never stay here again not only was the front desk unsympathetic lacking in customer service skills but almost rude as if it was my fault. Highly disappointed. I have included pictures of this tattered ‚Äújr suite‚Äù next to the loudest adjoined room. :(
40,Ceasars is lovely but very very expensive to eatshop etc. My room was comped however I'm sure I covered it 10 times gambling. You don't even get coffee in the room anymore unless you pay big bucks. Not for folks on a budget.
20,Staying in Caesars and the food court closed but their higher end restaurants open.  Pool also closed. Had to walk the extra mile for food. But resort fee still applied.  Check out was 11am I called for a later check out at 12:30pm. not an unreasonable request but I was told that it would cost $35. I said no thanks I then asked for 12 Noon told me to hold while they checked with a manager then they told me I would still get charged for a 12 Noon Checkout I said not and asked to speak to a Manager Rep came back on the line and said my late request of only 1 hour was granted at no cost but why not give me it at first ?    Caesar's have become too big and don't really care about your business. not even during a pandemic. You think they would be trying to encourage business but no They still want to get you for everything and not really care about you. and Still the resort fee. First and last time for me staying at this dated hotel with dated ideas. There are SO many other nicer and newer hotels on the strip with BETTER customer service People that are happier to have your business.
50,My room was amazing the view was amazing and the service was fast and amazing. I love that you could text instead of call very convenient. I would definitely recommend and come back again. Also the cost of the room was beyond unbelievable.
40,Rooms were spacious and nice. Line is always long for front desk and now many people working. There was some good and some bad. Good location and nice big bathtub. If you don't to valet be prepared to walk a mile to the car.
50,Confused about pricing.employees could not seem to explain. Price changing. Would love to give the flamingo a try again.hoping for much much much better rates in the future. Would love to keep coming back.
20,To start off it is ridiculous how far the parking structure is to the front desk. And it‚Äôs carpeted pulling a wheeled suitcase that far across a casino on carpet is not what I imagined for my relaxing vacation not to mention the bell boys don‚Äôt come by for assistance. Now let‚Äôs go to the room once we made it there 6 miles later the Octavian suite....SUITE...was far from impressive. Dirty old furniture the halls smelled like old piss and stale weed and when the doors closed from surrounding rooms it sounded like someone was entering and leaving your room. For the amount I paid I could‚Äôve at least been given a coffee kit but no...a damn K Cup was extra! This hotel is nothing near nice or luxurious in addition late check out was an additional $34 dollars. I won‚Äôt be staying here again the hype is not worth it. Stay at the Venetian or Palazzo much nicer and their furniture doesn‚Äôt have stains or looks like it was pulled from a dumpster! Caesar Palace...more like Caesars broke bachelors pad.
50,Our first trip to Vegas it was perfect. Took our son for his 30th birthday Can't wait to come back. The service from check in room service and check out was exceptional. Access to so many different places to eat was a plus.
10,First and last time staying at Caesars Palace. What seems to be a luxury hotel you should expect quality service but it was like Little Caesars üçï service . Went for a friends bachelorette party and we booked a suite . Check in was not until 4pm which was understandable but because we were flying from PHX and getting there at around 8am we called to book a standard room with early check in (they new our early arrival situation) and they said they could accommodate our request . We get to the hotel check in and everything was a mess they said they had no rooms available and that check in is at 4pm  after telling them we called the Manager said she seen the notes from the call so we questioned why would we book 2rooms for the same time . Manager then offered to pull the call but what was the point if she was not going to be able to help us after that they were the ones who messed up our booking . Manger was very unhelpful and not sympathetic she said we can keep checking back periodically to see if the room was available earlier . We asked if she can call us to let us know she said no we have to keep coming back . So not only did they mess up our room but now we have wait all day at the hotel because we have to keep coming back to check. Well now we had to make their ‚Äúluxury‚Äù hotel look like a motel 6 because we had to get ready in their bathroom and of course guests looking at us crazy ( as they should ). After brunch (that we basically had to have at the hotel to keep checking back for our room ) we met with another Manager told him the situation said rooms are still not available and now our suite was not going to be available until 5pm because the guests before us have late check out . So again we are going back and forth and finally after a while the manager said due to mix up we can have a $100 credit for food and drinks and free late check out . A nice gesture but it just proves how long you have to fight before they start offering some type of ‚Äúrelief‚Äù to the situation. Again nice gesture but not impressed . So finally we get our room finish our stay and all of the horrible service should be water under the bridge right ? WRONG. We go to use the kiosk check out and if you‚Äôve been to Caesars during covid you hAve to go through all the ropes get your temp checked etc. the kiosk was literally in front of us so we Skipped going through all the empty ropes and went to the kiosk an employee stopped us saying no we have to go through the temp check which he was right and we should do that it‚Äôs a rule we should be following it so we did the right thing and listened. Seconds later a white woman does same things and the employee welcomes her and guides her to the kiosk! Now I am not those people that tries to pull color into every situation but to me that was a little weird to see and anyone can have their opinion on that I just wanted to throw that in . So now we check out get our receipt and there are extra charges for mini bar use so back to the manager we go. Employee said if drank anything we said no he said maybe it was moved (I didn‚Äôt even notice the mini bar in our room Personally) but again he kept questioning if we used it we said no so he took off the charges and said we should read the signs next time to not touch . Wow. So remember our $100 credit for their mix up ? We were only staying one night and again it was for a bachelorette party so our days were booked with activities so we didn‚Äôt have time to use it but since we had late check out and we‚Äôre not going back to PHX until 6pm we thought ok we can use it while we wait to go to the airport. WRONG! Now the employee said oh you can‚Äôt use it anymore you checked out already . Whattttt!?!? If there are rules on those credits they literally need to say them upfront because how is a customer going to know what they don‚Äôt know?If that was told to us before you don‚Äôt think we would have used it before we checked out come on now. Horrible service never again!!!
40,I would just like to say that the room was fantastic! The staff were all very friendly helpful and willing to go a little extra to make sure you were happy. The table dealers were helpful as well when playing a game you didn't 100% understand and they took a moment to explain it as best they could given the time frame they had. One thing I didn't like was the number of slots and other games that were broken. Out of the 5 casinos I visited Caesars was the only one that had broken games all over the place. Please take some of that cash flow and put it into keeping your games maintained and invest in new technology games. I was looking for the horse racing game  but it seems only Luxor has one that I can tell.
50,Huge thank you to Nathan Bryers at Caesars who saved our stay. He was awesome and we really enjoyed our time at The Palace! The Casino Forum Shops and restaurants are ALL amazing! Make sure you Head to the Monte Cristo Cigar Bar as well. Great vibes and fun times.
10,Management was horrible expect one male named Ralph who was the only one that did an amazing job. Everyone was rude and from all of our issues that they created they make it seem liked no one cared about the isssues.
30,Room was luxurious king suite. Spacious whirlpool bath with shower big enough for a small party! Very comfortable king bed large well furnished living room. Hotel was great but the front desk needs a refresher-course in how to set up a reservation! Check in was a nightmare. We were told we didn't have a reserved room! Even after I made a huge deposit! Depending on who you talk to at front desk everyone has a different story on refunded deposit amount. Best restaurant is the Americano! Marijuana smells all over the place...so security should crack down. It's a gamblers heaven;every game imaginable.
40,My husband and I stayed at Caesars mid-February. It is classic Vegas and good location center strip. Every staff member we interacted with was pleasant. We stayed in the Octavius Tower. The room was nice clean and comfortable. The bathroom is big with a nice big tub. Housekeeping service was good happy that they are cleaning rooms again. There is a Kuerig in the room but no coffee. We brought our own K-cups which worked fine. I found it inconvenient as far as the location it is a long walk from room to casino especially to the sports bar or Forum Shops.  The casino was clean with lots of slot machine options. The cocktail service was bad we played for hours and was never offered a drink (we also played at Harrahs and Flamingo and service was great). We did not win anything and don‚Äôt really expect to but it would be nice if the machines didn‚Äôt just eat your money and would let you play a little while.  Due to the pandemic restaurants and bars are limited so some planning is required. Though the casino had good size crowds every night we were there and probably could have justified opening some more venues.  Overall I liked this casino but would stay in a smaller casino from a convenience standpoint.
10,We booked for 4 nights and 5 days. We waited at the check in desk for about an hour and a half because they over booked the rooms. They gave us another room for a night and promised that they will void the registration fee for our stay and give us $50 food credit. We stayed night and when I called them in the morning to check on our room then the help desk said someone will contact us but no response. I called again and we were told to check out of the room before 11 unless we will be charged even though it wasn't our mistake that they didn't had room. Anyways I went to the check in/check out and ask about the exact information. I was told that the room will be available between 12-1 and we need to check in by 1 unless they will give the room to another customer since it won't occupied. I made it very clear that we planned out trip and our day is going to be waste. We ended up staying at the hotel and one of our day was a waste. Finally when we were checking out on our last day I found out that nothing is voided and I received the $50 credit. So unprofessional and poor management.
50,Representative Dany (and his lovely supervisor earlier today at about 4:40pm) were so gracious prompt and thorough in helping me solve a booking error. Dany was easy-to-talk to and was very helpful in making my check-in from a stressful experience to a very casual affair. Excellent service by a dedicated staff this may the first time I‚Äôve stayed with Caesars but by no means the last...a wonderful representative that turned my experience immediately around.    With Cordial Regards    Mr. Jordan Michael
20,We have stayed at Caesars many times -- we looked forward to returning again after a year without travel. Unfortunately Caesars did not live up to our expectations. First -- the positives: it is centrally located and the Forum shops are nice. Now - the negatives.  1 - the check-in process was TERRIBLE. The line to get to the registration desk snaked through the lobby. We had to wait approximately 1 hour for our turn. (I am not kidding. It was so long that I went to a bar came back with two bloody Marys and my wife was in the same location. The line looked twice as long for those who were checking in last night. THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. We could have used one of the few kiosks but we were hoping to check in at noon and we were told that we could not do that at the kiosk. To make matters worse - the Seven Seas members had a separate line for the same registration spots. They would jump ahead of everyone. I don't know what you need to do to get a Sevens Seas [or Seven Springs or whatever it is called] ranking. Regardless of whether they make more money than us or their parents left them more money than ours or they are prettier than us don't rub it in our face that they are better than us. Give them a separate room to check in. Letting them jump the line over people who have waited a long time makes the check-in process even more distasteful.  2 - many of the shops were still closed (even thought the facility seemed to be relatively crowded).  3 - we were asked at check -in if we wanted room service each day. It doesn't matter how you respond - they may or may not come. Neither our room nor the room of the people who were travelling with us were cleaned yesterday.  4 - there were heavily armed private security guards each night (with guns strapped to their legs and extra rounds of ammo on their utility belts). I guess that their presence should make me feel safe. Actually just the opposite. The fact that they need to be there makes me less comfortable.  5 - the staff in general was less friendly and hospitable than they should be. In contrast we were looking for a restaurant in the linq. I asked a maintenance man to point us in the right direction -- he stopped what he was doing and walked us to the restaurant. I just don't see that happening at Caesars.    I could keep going - but you get my point.    Next time -- we most likely stay somewhere else
30,One night stay was okay... I was a little surprised and disappointed to see people on property with their mask down and laughing about not complying... I seen management walk by and not say a word üò° It was strange to see sooo many venues closed COVID-19 has a presences as Las Vegas is known to be vibrant... it seemed so meh üôÅ I am looking forward to the day when we can get past this pandemic ü•¥
50,I have to say I got really lucky to have MEHRET help with my check in process! She was amazing in helping me with my upgrade with her Manager and I was beyond pleased! Thank you to her help and her manager my stay was amazing at Ceasars Palace! Thank you so much MEHRET! PLUS...every precaution was taken at Ceasars Palace during these hard times of COVID. CLEAN!! ROOM CLEAN!!! CUSTOMER SERVICE EXCELENTE'!!  Thank you and Stay Safe.
10,So I stayed at Caesar's so-called Premium Loreal Collection room but before you even read my opinion please take a moment to look at the pictures and witness this to yourself.    Forget about sanitization but I wouldn't stay in this type of room even offered for free the room was disgustingly full of dust and dirty felt like was never cleaned in months and the Bathroom was even worse and there were spots blood stains and other craps over the wall you can see. I assure you if you go to a public restroom at the airport that would be more clear and clean than this.    Not to mention after taking shower every night there was a puddle outside with the amount of water leaking from the shower.    Room service was another disappointment those people are rude.    I would recommend if you are planning to have a pleasant stay and peace of mind especially at this time with a pandemic where sanitation and cleaning is not an optional step and just by checking the temperatures of people who approach the customer service they are showing that they only care about their representatives but not the gusts staying theirs by any mean.
50,Best hotel in Vegas I been to so far.. very clean employees there are super helpful the inside looks beautiful the view in the Augustus side is the best you can see the strip and the water show they have on the strip
40,Great trip. Got Estandby upgrade to signature level suite in Julius Tower. Suite was great. View was not so good but room made up for it. Only reason this trip doesn‚Äôt get a 5 star rating was they charged entire hotel bill upfront which didn‚Äôt allow me to use my Caesar Reward points to pay for the hotel bill that I had been saving up when checking out.
20,The trip started out great we were offered a free upgrade to our room on Valentines day weekend. Everything was amazing until 4:45 in the morning when another guest tried to enter our room luckily it was locked from the inside so he could not enter. He proceeded to bang on the door until we woke up and was arguing with me that I was in his room I can‚Äôt say I blame him because he was given a key to the same room that I was already occupying. After an argument through the door he finally left and I called to the front desk to share my experience with them where I was basically told it wasn‚Äôt a big deal because it‚Äôs not like he was actually in my room. When I said that if we didn‚Äôt lock the door from the inside and relied just on the key card or if we had left our luggage in the room and went down to the casino or out in the town the person would have been able to access our room. Overall I was very disturbed not only with the experience but the reaction I got from the staff member I spoke with about the issue. The room was great but the experience left a horrible taste in my mouth about this hotel.
30,Hotel staff was not really friendly. During check-in they mentioned you will be on 50th floor and will have a pool view but turn out to be 50th floor is really 2nd floor and pool was only 30% visible.  Many things in room were broken (curtain handle bathroom cabinet washroom commode used to take 20 mins to fill the tank). They did not allow to grant different room and were not polite when complained.
40,Trip was very good. Checkin/checkout was very easy via the kiosk.. $75 charge for early checkin was a litgle excessive especially when check in was 4pm and i was there at 3pm..also parking lot/elevators were very unorganized.. Kiosks were not excepting room keys had to pay the $18/day fee
50,We have been receiving excellent service since we've arrived friendly staff quick answers to questions with Ivy lots of machine selections the Casino is large and lots to see and the rooms are gorgeous
20,The hotel restaurants lounges and cigar bars were great. Our disappointment is specially related to our room. We both travel quite a bit and have stayed in various levels of hotel. Needless to say the room experience is important to us. Never before have we experienced a hotel the caliber of Caesar‚Äôs Palace not offer standard hotel room amenities. No robes no bath/shower gel no disposable cups for coffee or disposable glasses to use with the mini bar (missed opportunity for revenue). We looked forward to leveraging the jacuzzi tub however there were no bath salts or any bath products. I was actually told to use the same bar of soap used for hand washing to use in the shower... appalling. This is not a Covid related issue because these items are simply basic and expected in a place like Caesars. When I complained (several times) no one seemed to care or even explain why the decision to not offer these items was made.  We truly looked forward to making Caesar‚Äôs our new hotel destination in Vegas because of the property housing most places we enjoy.  We were both simply shocked at just how lacking the amenities in the room were. A Holiday Inn offers more than Caesar‚Äôs.    We typically stay at the Cosmopolitan and after this experience we most certainly will return there.
30,A lot of shops are closed still. Our room had an awesome tub but the AC was not working correctly. It kept shutting off and it was really warm in there. There were only two spots to get coffee in the morning. Both had long lines and ran out of certain options.
10,Over Priced rooms are old outdated. Bell service would not pick up the phonewaited over 30 min for them to answer no luck. Operator tried and she had no luck. I had to pick up my luggage myself. I prepaid for a king size bed ended up in a double occupancy room with two twin beds at the end of hall on 59th floor where it takes 20 min plus to get to hotel lobby. Staff refused to Change my room. If you want to check in 15 min or 30 min before 4 p. M. It is a 75.00 charge. RIDICULOUS. DONT STAY HERE GO TO Aria or Bellagio. Anywhere but here.
50,Caesars is a massive property! I was there for a CPE Conference and really needed a room in a good location to get to and from the conference center each day. I checked in with Daniel at the front desk and he was very accommodating in getting me a good room location.
30,Since covid brought the price down we decided to take a chance at a more expensive hotel not a good idea. As the room and hotel were beautiful there were ZERO amenities snacks for u to look at but can‚Äôt touch coffee pot for you to look at without coffee and a nice ball of hair in the shower... I was not impressed sorry
50,excellent attention at the check inn good security and excellent security standards or Covid-19. Parking free excellent location and All in one place. best shopping centers luxury decoration I would definitely stay in the same place again.
30,Got the bathroom upgrade with a jacuzzi tub and when I fill it up all the water and tub was so dirty I didn‚Äôt even get to use it till the next day that they came to clean it after I requested to have it cleaned I also asked for extra towels they never gave me any extra just the same amount of when I came in
50,Caesar‚Äôs is always our go to stay in Vegas. Especially want to thank Adam Miller for his help with our stay. He needs a raise! Thank you Adam for your help and making our stay so enjoyable.    We were upgraded to the Palace Tower double bed. Love this room because it‚Äôs spacious and has two bathrooms and a huge closet. Room was clean felt safe and will be back! Thank you.
10,We did not receive the room we reserved. The manager Brad Parks said someone would text us the next morning to let us know when our room would be available the next day if we still wanted to move into a room that we had originally picked out. Apparently no communication between managers so the next day after 3 attempts to get our situation figured out we finally did get into our room. Our 3rd night there after walking for miles and miles to go to our room for rest we had been locked out of our room. From beginning to end Caesars Palace left a bad taste in my mouth and will not be using this hotel for our next visit. The one great thing they did too was daily cleanings and fresh towels.
20,I brought my husband to Las Vegas for his first trip. We booked a room through Caesars Palace into center of the strip in general he has good reviews. We had initially booked a deluxe king room in the Octavia is tower but upon arrival were told that tower was closed daring the week and we were being ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù to the palace tower. Now the location is nice the room itself is not much different than staying at a Holiday Inn express. The room is smaller than what we booked the bed is smaller than what we booked and as you can tell from the photos when you open the closet door the air-conditioning system was filthy there‚Äôs tears in the carpet the furniture is old and dated with many many scuffs and blemishes. For a place that supposed to be a luxury hotel I have stayed in better three star hotels such as the Westin once again the Holiday Inn express. Services bars which is a little understandable due to Covid but when there‚Äôs no one here you would think they would try to cater to the people who are actually here. If you‚Äôre coming to Caesars hope you have a better experience than we did. Should I booked a room at the Venetian or the Bellagio or the Linq we‚Äôve been in all those facilities to visit and everyone has been wonderful there. I hate to say it Cesar but your name will only get you so far especially in a time where people really are struggling to come and enjoy a little bit of vacation and escape all of the current chaos that we are living in
30,We were out Gambling and having fun and the front desk went in our room with out permission and rifled thru our bags. We called and complained but nothing was done to make up for their actions. DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE
20,Resort fees and valet fees are total rip off food was below average and way overpriced. Rooms were clean but noisy hallway. It was my 60th bday celebration will Try again with a cruise next year!! This was a HUGE let down!!
40,Stayed here fir a quick trip and stayed at the Forum Tower let‚Äôs start with this tower needs to be renovated and updated.    The hallway needs fresh paint and new carpeting.    The rooms are good size but they are not as tidy and clean. The furniture and decor is outdated and for Ceaser‚Äôs it needs to be improved.    Love the restaurants and shops big reason why I stay here and love but the tower needs to TLC.
10,"broken tv broken curtains charged for items not used from ""mini bar"" hot water took forever!!! Not worth the price nor headache!!!!! Horrible experience. Not what it hypes out to be. Walls are paper thin security guards and staff extremely rude and unprofessional."
10,"I bought a package deal on priceline that said it would be $500 for both flight and hotel I pay it well I get to Caesars ""Rip Off"" Palace and next thing I know its another $500plus and tons of random unexplained charges. Never bought anything like movies or nothing only ate some skittles at the mini bar and nothing else.. ended up being close to $800 before it was all over with so a $500 trip turned to a $1300 trip with no explanation on the hotels part.. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY AT THIS PLACE IT IS HORRIBLE!!!!!"
30,Booked a king bed in premium resort suite. When I went to check in the kiosk would not allow it. Went to kiosk attendant who informed me that my room was not available and that he would try to find a double queen room. I told him that I wanted a king bed room. He stated all king rooms were sold. As a Diamond member I asked if VIP was open. He stated it was abd I went there to find it closed. I Then had to go back into check in line and wait another 15 min only to get to agent who again told me to wait another 5 to 10 minutes. He came back an told me that my reserved room was not available and that I would have to take whatever they gave me. I asked to speak to the manager and she came and apologized for my inconvenience but she would not do anything more than give me their available room. No offer of any meal credits or upgrade to a bigger suite with king bed or a reduction in room rates. Nothing. Just an ultimatum of accepting room given or canceling. Caesar's used to value customers but that has changed. Wont be staying there every again. Go to another Caesar's property because its flag ship is not customer friendly.
50,Really nice hotel with great rooms and great location on the strip for walking! Of course everything is expensive but that's Las Vegas. We walked down to the Wynn and what a beautiful lobby. Only bad part was that we couldn't get into the pool area because of them limiting number of people due to Covid.
50,So when my husband says on a Tuesday let's go to Vegas Thursday I'm on it. Decided to search hotels we have not stayed at and along came Caesars. The rooms looked nice and what a great deal. Probably one of the better deals. The room was huge. I could do cartwheels and work out. So spacious with a seating area and another looking out the window towards the Bellagio fountains and strip. We stayed in the Augusta tower. We were quite surprised with the amount of places to go and eat. We actually never left the hotel. We also discovered a whole other shopping area on the way to the pool which I was excited about because they had Nectar one of my favorite stores. All in all it was a good getaway. Will definitely stay again and hope to soon
40,We were in Vegas at Caesars for 5 days and had a good time!  Most notably was:  1) Eric checked us in at the Diamond area and was patient and gave us a great room!  2) Laura Nevarez our Host was outstanding! She was Pleasant was Available and Helpful!!    Although our money stayed in VEGAS We will definitely go back. We were not a fan of the new format of the slot tournament: have to get 100 tier to qualify and you get 10 spins at whatever machine you are playing at. You check kiosk at the end of evening to see if you won anything...and if ...for example played $3000 to compete ---and placed at level that paid you-- $50 ---you have to claim it within 72 hours or you lose it too. The Diamond /Laurel Lounge was closed because of Covid-19...and we did not get our Diamond Dinner either was given 2 tickets to Highroller instead...which we did not get to use...And forget getting drinks on the floor!  GOOD Customer Service can offset ALOT! :)
10,The rooms are ok but not for what they charge on a monday night. Not worth it at all. No amenities a resort fee in which the gym is closed so why the fee. Over priced food and drinks. No service on floor to get a Dixie cup drink. Was the worst Birthday ever.. Thanks Caesars Palace would not recommend.
40,Caesars is mid-strip which is nice if you're planning to walk around a lot but do keep in mind that Caesars is HUGE. Just to walk from the parking lot to the lobby to check in takes 15 min+. Checking-inwas reasonably quick. Very long line but they have self service kiosks which is nice. I really wished the kiosk provided some type of info on the hotel in addition to the form with the room number. There aren't fliers or maps in the room and with all the covid closures we ended up having to look the hotel up on the internet constantly to try to figure out what was open and where things were. The room was large and really clean. Beds are a bit on the firm side. The floor we were on smelled kinda heavily of pot smoke but that's probably more an issue of the other guests than the hotel itself. Casino is big and clean. Lots of options to play. Didn't visit any of the restaurants as said above - hard to know what hours things were open and since no walk-ins right now and no clear number to call or way to reserve we just ended up booking outside the hotel on open table. Price was good. Never interacted with any staff the entire stay so can't speak to service. We'd stay there again!
50,Took my girlfriend to Vegas for her birthday and we had a great time. Vegas was quiet but it was nice. Beautiful room over looking the strip was nice and the room was clean and very comfortable. Caesars always keeps things first class.
20,This was my first attempt at staying at Caesar‚Äôs property and it wasn‚Äôt exactly smooth. Check in was a disaster to say the least. The line was long as in 90 mins or longer. You can do the express check in but know this you won‚Äôt get a room before 4pm. Once you get to the counter it still takes awhile to get checked in: I‚Äôm still Not sure what the hold up is... But with covid as an excuse who knows.  The Good) The room was actually nice n modern; as in recently refurbished. The modern lines are a nice refresh to the older tan n beige marble theme for sure. The bath was clean and well lit: and the water pressure was as good as I‚Äôve ever experienced in a hotel. So relaxing to have spa like experience in a regular shower. The bed was quite comfortable. The View was decent but not when compared to Cosmopolitan or Bellagio.  The Bad) Expect no amenities: unless you consider free WiFi being worth $51 per day. Real amenities; such as pool hot tub spa or workout room are all closed. In my opinion the fee should be reduced a bit during the closure. If the amenities aren‚Äôt available what is the fee for? But from what I‚Äôm reading most of the other resorts are doing the same.  The Ugly) I consider myself well traveled and have visited Vegas more times than I can count. I‚Äôve stayed in nearly every resort on the strip: from Wynn n Encore Venetian n palazzo to Bellagio and most of City Center. And if one reads my reviews they‚Äôll notice I‚Äôm particular but fair. And even with a complaint or 2 here n there I‚Äôve never mentioned anyone by name. But the front desk clerk I encountered at Caesar‚Äôs Delano may have been the rudest person I‚Äôve dealt with in 35 yrs of travel. While standing there he said ‚Äúcheck in isn‚Äôt until 4. If you want an early check in it‚Äôs a $50 fee.‚Äù I said I‚Äôve never heard of that is it on the website? He said ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have to put anything on the website‚Äù. It was about 1:30pm at this point. I asked if he would mention to mng that it‚Äôd be nice to know after traveling all night to get here and standing in line this long. He said ‚ÄúNo I work at the counter here. If you wanna talk to mng you can call them yourself‚Äù. He also didn‚Äôt like that I booked through a 3rd party which saved me $$$. Why it mattered I do not know. But his tone was the surprising part in this: I‚Äôm still not understanding the rude attitude: I‚Äôve never seen this before. So I Called the hotel and they were able to get me in a room much earlier. I will say I always check into whichever hotel I‚Äôm staying with as soon as I‚Äôve gotten into town; like most people. And if a room isn‚Äôt available they simply call when it is. There‚Äôs no fee ever mentioned.  Overall honestly I don‚Äôt recommend Caesar‚Äôs for your hotel stay. With so many excellent choices up n down the strip I‚Äôm betting you can get a better experience for less. Still Not sure why things went like they did but as for me I have to take it into consideration when booking my next stay.... Remember you are the customer so you can be picky.  PS.... every other single worker here was extra friendly and helpful....
50,This hotel was super clean and beautiful. My sister and I took a bday trip to Vegas for the first with no clue on where to stay. This hotel is conveniently located across from Hell‚Äôs Kitchen and walking distance from drai‚Äôs nightclub we had a blast. The staff were friendly. We are going back!
50,I want to give a shout out to Caesars Palace for the great and awesome service we received from team member Mehret. She is an asset to your Casino and check in services. We checked in last night and was given A+ service from Mehret!! This really was a relief for us cause we received poor service from our shuttle service driver and being that it was almost 1am we figured everyone would be just as tired and grouchy but Mehret really gave us top service which brought a smile to our faces.
10,Took a weekend to go to Las Vegas to meet my son who is in the USMC in California. Was looking for some fun father son time. My flight arrived before my sons so I went to hotel to check in. While checking in I asked the nice young lady working the line (Katie or Kayle or something similar) if the fitness center was open. She replied yes but with slightly limited hours and said open until 6 today. I went to my room changed clothes and went to fitness center to get in a workout before my son arrived. This is when the fun started - I arrived at the fitness center and the incredibly rude girl at the counter told me ‚Äúthe fitness center closed at 4‚Äù - it was 4:05. I told her that the front desk had advised they were open until 6. In her dismissive and disrespectful tone she said ‚Äúthey are aware of our hours we open tomorrow at 6am.‚Äù I respond that apparently they don‚Äôt because why would I specifically ask and then go to my room and change to walk to a closed fitness center. Again she was completely dismissive and literally looked at me as if I were just dumb.  I return and walk by the front desk and see the same nice young lady who had advised earlier. She I had changed clothes (and was wearing my mask) she obviously didn‚Äôt initially recognize me - so if by chance I misunderstood I was ask her again. She confirmed 6pm. I relayed my encounter - SO I GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE - she responded very apologetically and removed the resort fee for the day.
10,I booked Caesars via hotels.com for a couples trip. I normally stay at a different hotel every time I travel to Vegas. Caesars is aesthetically pleasing with some really solid restaurants. We booked the Augustus tower and requested a strip/Bellagio fountain view.    At check-in we were offered an ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù by the concierge. The upgrade was a ‚Äúhandicap‚Äù room with a better view. We graciously accepted because what the heck we‚Äôre not going to be staying in our room a lot. Come to find out we had a major plumbing issue with the shower (safety issue). Basically terrible drainage. The floor was sopping wet!    I went back to check-in and requested a manager. Katie was the manager on duty. She was a good listener but failed to provide above and beyond customer service especially considering COVID-19 pandemic. I provided Katie with the video of the terrible drainage. She offered two terrible options. 1) move to another room 2) send a plumber to the room.    I expected stellar customer service and offered my own recommendation on making my situation whole. She denied my request on what I thought was a very reasonable resolution. I walked away when she insulted me with a $25 restaurant concession.    I turned to twitter and posted the video and my dissatisfaction with Caesars. An agent reached out via direct message. Basically ‚Äúguest satisfaction‚Äù is out top priority and we sent your information to the right team.    Unfortunately nobody contacted me. So disappointing.
50,Best place to stay on the strip. The rooms are always spotless and service is wonderful. Thanks to Eric W in Seven Stars check in for helping with several questions and making dining reservations. We will be staying here on any future trips.
10,We came to Caesars Palace for a relaxing weekend getaway but we had the opposite. We arrived before check in and were happy to find that a room was available for early check in. We then were informed of some upgrades available and decided to treat ourselves. This was our first time staying at a caesars property in a long time and we had heard good things about their suites. Boy were those people wrong. When we arrived in the suite all of the decorations were broken or missing which is really not a big deal. We dropped our luggage in the room turned down the AC and headed out to the strip. When we returned 6 hrs later to change we noticed the room was still warm so we turned down the AC further and went to dinner with our friends. When we returned to the suite an additional 9 hrs later the room was sweltering hot. At this point it was 4 am so we decided to suffer for one and talk with the front desk in the morning. All night we were awoken by the all toilets running and AC switching on and off without cooling. Spoke with the front desk and they we‚Äôre willing to move us and wave the upgrade fee for that night. We also received and offer to extend our stay for one more complimentary nigh via text. We let the manager that we spoke with know that we would love to do this as well. She stated that our stay would be extended for one additional night in the suite with us just paying resort fees and not paying the upgrade fee. I am very disappointed to say that we were charged an upgrade fee for that night and when we asked to speak with the same manager she stated that she never promised that. I can‚Äôt believe a manager could be so dishonest. I am very disappointed and will not stay here again.
30,The rooms were nice and clean. The casino wasn‚Äôt. The carpet was starting to come up in some areas causing a small trip here and there. The slot machines were worthless. We played there and other casinos and Caesars did not pay out at all. We didn‚Äôt expect to win big but theirs were ridiculous.
50,I would just like to commend Mia or Maria and Daniel at the front desk. Maria gave us a free upgrade to an absolutely amazing beautiful room and she was so incredibly nice. Daniel also got us a wonderful rate on an extra day that we decided to stay. They are both exceptional employees.
50,I will be coming back i had a blast loved the hotel loved the rooms loved the service loved the people i will for sure recommend Caesars Palace best place ever. Me and my family will be back soon and i cant wait !!!!
20,The check-in process took almost an hour due to low staffing and faulty kiosks. Security and front desk staff were unpleasant and at times rude. The rooms look like they were designed in the 1980s. The view was unimpressive. They provide K-Cups and a coffee machine and charge for it. Relative to other Vegas hotels this one is in shambles. The resort fee is a shake-down. Stay next store at the Bellagio. Infinitely more clean luxurious and professional.
20,Room is dirty and dated wild had stains on them and overall grounds have not been taken care of beer bottles and dirt cigarettes everywhere. Parking was supposed to be free but charge me $40 $20 per dayFront desk said they could not take care of that call 800 number
50,Room was clean bathroom was awesome with jacuzzi and a split bathroom and double shower heads. Bed was amazing and the view of the pools were great. I don‚Äôt really have any negatives to say. There was a lot of store and restaurant closures when we got there on Wednesday and everything slowly started opening up on Friday.
10,Need to do better!!! Bathroom was dirty pee stain on the toilet! Tv remote was nasty and sticky! Worst experience!!!!!!!!!! I do not recommend you to stay here! Caesar needs better employees. Go to a motel 6!
10,Such an awful experience from the moment I checked in I was treated so poorly for no reason. Hotel isn‚Äôt very clean either. I will never stay here again and actually ended up booking at another hotel!
30,Shocked they are really letting this place go. It is generally worn out and beat up looking. The economy is taking its toll. Why are we forced to pay a $50 for a food court? Most everything was closed. Huge let down.    Valet parking was ‚Äúfull‚Äù except diamond members. It was not crowded at all. Self parking is dirty and FAR away. Octavius/Augustus side entrance blocked off except limos / VIP.    Casino games are tight as a drum. The ones that are working anyway. Many are shout off or broken. Like an old arcade.    Octavius tower being the newest is depressing. It‚Äôs a far walk from everything too. Wallpaper peeling by the elevators and the rooms have the worn out feel. Pretty clean but not much you can do when things are damaged or broken. If it was full price this place would be a complete scam. $100 room max. Offered a free extra night be we passed. Not worth it.    Overall we are crossing off Caesars from our list in Vegas. Location on the strip is basically the only thing they have going for them. Much better options these days. The old glory properties are dying. Venetian/Palazzo is much nicer cleaner and fresher feeling.
50,This was my 2nd time staying time here within in 2 months my first time was in November and fell in love with this place very clean amazing service and the staff is extremely helpful stayed at all the mgm resorts in vegas before and i can stay im officially a caesar's palace guy from now on
20,Not at all what we expected. Arrived at 11:30 p.m. on January 9 2021. The women at the front desk acted as if we were bothering her and didn't want to be there. Never once smiled or looked at me. Never added my second person to the room so he could not charge to the room. She was very clinical and it was a bad start. Didn't ask if we needed help to our room. Getting to the room was a nightmare in Palace Tower. Got to the room it was clean but all the way at the end of the hall. What was also surprising was how much noise we could hear from the highway. I would hate to be staying here when pool parties are going on.  I figured the pool would be closed but we were not even able to walk around the area and take pictures.  $51 for a resort fee is abused when we don't use the gym the pool is closed and wifi is unnecessary. Also we declined use of housekeeping.  The casino floor is incredibly small for the size of the resort. Cocktail service is almost nonexistent unless you are at the tables.  Was charged $25 for a phone call that we never made and they refused to remove it.  My credit card was put on hold like normal but then all charges were removed at checkout to be fully charged again 6 days later. I've never had any place to that before.  Trying to take Uber or Lyft is also a pain. You have to go to the parking garage which is not easy to get to. Lucky for us we had drivers that would pick us up and drop us off in valet even though they were not supposed to.  For what is supposed to be one of the best resorts on the strip we were highly disappointed.  This was our first time staying at a Caesars property and it will be our last.
30,The room is very nice they is a keurig coffee maker but they won't supply kcups. The frig is stocked with their stuff and they won't let you .take stuff out so you can put in water or anything else you want without ab$75. fee. SINGLE PLY toilet paper.....really? It's not like they don't make millions. I just expected better.
30,"First the positives:  Location- walking distance to many things  Free on site parking for those lodging at the hotel  Well maintained hotel room    Negatives:  $50 extra resort fee I asked what it went towards the answer was ""free Wi-Fi and two free gym passes per day"". Ok so I realize it is January and the pool would not be open BUT the entire area was CLOSED! I am a photographer and was looking forward to taking pictures in the courtyard/pool area especially at night. This was a huge disappointment for me. And the Wi-Fi turns out it is free for only TWO people per room! We only had two people but the extra fee for additional people was insane!  The parking garage is at the other end of the casino which means you have to walk through the casino...and I'm not talking about walking on main walkways...I mean through the casino to get to your room. I saw people hauling their luggage pushing strollers and walking around slot machines to get through the casino. Not designed well for those staying at the hotel.  In the room there was a fridge...but it had drinks in it...which I expected...but did not have room for the few things we actually wanted to put in the fridge. I took out the non perishable things (like the Pepsi cans) and put our few things in it.  The front of the hotel is geared for Valet so that's fine if you are using valet. But if you are just checking in? There was no where to park easily. While I was checking in my daughter who was in the car was told to move the car (I thought we were out of the way). She isn't allowed to drive the rental so the valet person got in and moved it! So if you aren't using valet you are second class...no place for you even if you are staying at hotel.  Most of the restaurants were not open including the food court. We ended up eating dinner at Starbucks our first night.  I don't think I would stay here again. It was too big and too much of a process to check in park and walk a great distance to our room."
20,Ivy the online room service texted us to see if we needed anything and we replied with yes we wanted dinner and just kept asking us if we needed anything. talked to front desk they said to just order food from one of the restaurants if we wanted food which was high$$$. No more staying at ceasers palace for us.
50,Visited to see wedding venues..outstanding!! Loved the Venus garden beautiful and intimate with ease of access from palace tower. Room was big very clean and room service was fast and friendly. Check out just as easy using the phone app to control tv..
30,The hotel itself looks nice and pretty up to date given how old the property is. The place looks clean and well laid out. The room was clean as well. The drawbacks from my perspective are:  1) There aren't as many slot games (and variety) as other casinos 2) the drink service was the worst that I experienced. Hours before you can track down a server. 3) Finding the Uber pickup was a nightmare. No signs posted until you are almost at the pick up location; it took me around 25 minutes to find it.    I used the self-check in kiosk took just a couple of minutes to check in! Not sure why people still line up to be checked in by an attendant. One of the best things about Caesar's is the location - very central. I also love the fact that the Cheesecake Factory is housed within the property - my absolute favorite place to eat. Amazing dishes good quantity and fair prices!
30,Palace is a beautiful looking hotel and staff was nice. However I expected more from the room. Our headboard was worn and tore up yes tore/cuts. Sofa old and outdated. Hotel is to nice for avg rooms
10,Ok- so since about 1990 I‚Äôd stayed in Vegas a good 30 plus times. This was by far the WORST. The event that happened to my WIFE was unacceptable by escorting OUT a woman having a smoke-indices asthma attack. Shame on Victor Ocegieda - security Mgr for NEVER calling us back as well.
10,But it seems that the Hotel is abusing  we had pay in advance rooms  pictures were nice when we got it ! At the reception we have been told to pay an extra for an upgrade and I did for two rooms ? Very disappointed to enter a similar room with a terrible view  did not worth the upgrade paid  Cesar palace concierge staff you can do better ! This is not my first time in your hotel that is my view
30,I brought my husband to Caesars for its right in the strip and he has never been to Vegas. They had no amenities for our stay. Not even free coffee in the room! We might come back and see a show at the collaseum but I will never stay at Caesars again!
10,They took a $200 deposit. I was told at check in that I would get it back immediately at check out. I found out that it takes 2-3 days to get it back. Real sad bs. I am very disappointed to get told one thing and than another by another hotel rep .
10,Charged $140 for using the fridge our keys were shut off the night before leaving we were lied to about getting a rollaway bed and the manager was completely rude and taunted us for having a poor stay.
40,We went from sunday to thursday and had a great time. The hotel is not good during the week though with not many options for eating available. The hotel didn‚Äôt have really any grab and go places. Even the little convenience store near our elevators was closed during the week. Our room was only ever cleaned once which is annoying because we would be out for the day. I will be returning to caesars but when things open up again because the limited options definitely constricted the trip
50,Outstanding service staff and accommodations at this hotel.    PROS  -CLEAN and safe hotel following covid protocols  -they have hand sanitizer at all entries including face masks  -free parking  -EXCELLENT service with FABIAN at the front lobby check in. He went above and beyond to help us with an issue. Super friendly professional and nice. He helped make our trip stress free!!!! Thanks Fabian!!!  -Starbucks in casino  -food court (only few open)  -vanderpump cocktail garden  -good location  -ALL staff here are helpful and friendly  -nice spacious hotel rooms  -beautiful pool  -Good casino restaurants: Raos & Gordon Ramsey (open)  -forum shopping
40,I am constantly in awe regarding the details in each and every thing in this hotel/casino. The architecture is amazing. I love just walking around especially the hallway of shops.
40,I‚Äôm very impressed by the beauty of the room and how spacious it is (21st floor). The bathroom is incredible with a nice tub. The only thing i wish was better was the bed. It was way to soft and hurt my back. Other than that it was a great stay.
30,Took the weekend to gather my head together before my surgery for cancer we got a suite thinking we would have a great view and although we had a great tub we had no window no sun light the room had a big mirror as a wall and the living room window was facing a wall we didn‚Äôt know when it was day . I was totally disappointed. Hi
50,My fianc√© and I booked a room in the Octavius tower and it was by far the nicest resort/hotel I have ever stayed in. The staff throughout the entire resort was super helpful and knowledgeable. The entire property was insanely clean probably the cleanest on the entire strip. We loved it so much that we have already booked our second trip!
20,Check in was great except 30 min line got upgraded but room had filthy windows torn carpet outlets that didn't work AC that took forever to cool the room and a jetted tub that didn't work. And in the hallway in front of our room there was a Q tip on the carpet for over a day that never got removed
40,Trip started off by being checked in by Tomak who was amazing. He helped maneuver our reservations so we were in connecting rooms with our friends. He was so great. The only bad thing was the cell service and wifi connection.
50,"We were greeted at the front desk by Delano who is an amazing kind spoken person. Answered our questions with a smile. Even tho we all wore our masks we saw his eyes smile. Difficult times but a much needed getaway for us. We would definitely recommend Caesars Palace! Also look for Delano"" like the other hotel hahahaha"" for outstanding service."
50,Excellent service from all. Clean hotel. Room was phenomenal. Shower and beds. They rock. Stay here cannot beat it. Highly recommend. Lots of food choices. Carry out delivery available. Staff very helpful. Even have tallvehicle parking.
50,I checked into the Palace on Thursday Jan 7th. ZANDRA was professional friendly and kind. Our checkin experience was great and seamless! The hotel has so much to offer! Our room met our expectations the food in every resturant was exquisite. This is my 2nd time here at Ceasars and I will come again! Hospitality was phenomenal. 5 stars üåü
20,Check in staff not friendly an treated like we were a burden. Thought they would offer an upgrade since it wasn‚Äôt peek season an with COVID to say thanks but no wanted to charge us. Room was horrible.
20,I just got here today.  Check in was fast which was unexpected.  Finding left over empty bottles from the previous guest on the vanity area in the room I just checked into was also not expected. just not in a good way.  The room we were given did not look like the room shown on their own website. I highly doubt it was the square footage listed. The was no little seating area as show in the pictures and is the whole reason I chose to upgrade from standard to this room. This room no way be able to accommodate the sofa pictured.    Coffee maker and no coffee pods-gotta pay extra for that.    $75 a day to use the fridge for personal use-laughable!    $51.02 for a resort fee for wifi and gym access -you have got to be kidding me!    Oh and the wifi isn‚Äôt great.    The bed is comfortable. The bathroom is nice.    Not much in the way of restaurants is open I am sure that is due to Covid.    I know this is a well know famous Vegas hotel but I have been to Vegas 10+ times and I am disappointed.    Caesar would be ashamed.
50,The check in process was short and easy. The room was great wirh super comfy beds and a fabulous large shower. Best part was the k cup machine in the room. We stayed in Julius tower double Queen. Bring your own cups and have easy cheap coffee. Would stay here again simply based on that! Pool area was large but the enforcement of masks seemed subjective which is annoying. Somewhat hard to get a cocktail waitress there though.
40,Caesar's Palace is a steady classic hotel/casino in Vegas. I was in the Augustus Tower in a corner room possibly a suite because it was 700 feet. It had a plush seating area with a loveseat chairs and ottoman...also views of the pools. The bathroom had two sinks a sinking tub and a glass-enclosed stand-alone shower. Augustus and Octavius towers are the farthest from the parking garage but I had no problem with the walk.
30,Arrived at Caesars palace on12-30-20 . I had a problem with valet they took my vehicle and parked it but never scanned my ticket to my vehicle ... so when I went to retrieve my car it wasn‚Äôt in there system !!!! Second I go to my room to call bell desk to bring my luggage I waited on the phone for 45 minutes!! No answer I had dinner reservations so I need my bags ASAP so I walked down stairs to the bell desk they stated about a 90 min for your bags and this is after a 45 minute wait on the phone plus having to go down there ! So finally the bell desk attendant said you can just take your own bags or wait 90 minutes... so not to happy I carried 6 bags up stairs!!! Not at all impressed with valet and bell desk !
10,"Never stay at a caesars resort based on the managers response to everything that occured at stay. On phone agreed to rollaway- then at resort told it was a Covid hazard then a manager said it was a fire hazard. When they wouldn't give a rollaway it took 3+ hours to receive an extra blanket and pillows(which they only brought pillowcase no pillow?) Told us there was a fridge with drinks that can be bought we moved the drinks to use for food storage- then charged $141 at checkout stating there are sensors under the items you move and that the fridge is NOT for personal use. They will reimburse but charge $75 for their inconvenience? Room cards were deactivated before 6am on the final day of stay and then the manager had the nerve to say that ""it was user error you were unable to open the door."" You're telling me three cards by three different people that worked fine the night before all of a sudden didn't know how to use the room card? When speaking with this ""Manager"" he said he was the only manager on duty on the whole property. The whole experience from tip based employees was great(such as dealers in the casino) however salaried employees like the front desk as well as this manager- should be replaced by a competent customer service rep. $51/night resort fee that was not stated at checkin just all around bad service and to have the nerve of blaming COVID for your crap service is insulting. Operating at 25% capacity you would think a casino wants to do all they can to bring in customers. Your company will fall just like the roman empire did."
40,New Years at Caesars was mixed. Room was excellent really happy that maid service was back from June. Gambling was average. Machines were tight to medium lost money but not all of it. Very disappointed that the three card poker was $25 a hand which priced me out of playing at the Palace.    The worst part of the trip and it really made it feel less of a luxury place was the terrible ordeal of breakfast.. There was simply not enough places open for breakfast. Lines at Starbucks ranged from 45 minutes to 1 1/2 hours and room service was not an option. The only breakfast place open was that insipid 24 hours American Cafe place and there were long lines there even for a High Diamond and there limited choices if you did not make the 11 AM breakfast rollover to lunch. The constant quest for morning coffee really was the worst part of the trip especially for my coffee addicted companion.    Also Caesars has to make a decision of what type of Casino it wants to be. The New Years crowd was kinda lowlife with lots of young drunk not well dressed people on the floors. My guess is most were not hotel Guests bu people wanting to experience the Palace. Theresa felt unsafe at times and though nothing happened to us personally hearing fights and drunkin bellowing. as we gambled did not make us feel like we were in a luxury environment. yes I know it was New Years but we were there last year for New Years and it never felt like this. Where was security???????    Still loved the Palace missed the party and the shows. Not sure if we will be back over New Years next year unless the parties and shows are back but we will be3 back especially since we made Diamond Elite for 2021.
40,It was nice for my first trip to Vegas. It's a little old fashioned for my taste but the experience was great. We stayed on the 42nd floor with a strip view so we got to see the Bellagio water show at night right from our room. It was magical. That part alone was a prefect to me. The Starbucks always had a long line and the workers were really slow considering the amount of people that were always in line. But it was a nice over all experience. The casino wasn't very crowed and the slot machine chairs were spaced out for distancing which was nice.
40,The hotel location is amazing and has a lot of good food options reservations for a majority of restaurants on the strip require reservations. We upgraded to a suite and was sadly disappointed that the refrigerator was dirty and had empty cans that the previous customers had left along with a half full ice bucket. Called housekeeping and someone came up to clean it she took a pic and left didn‚Äôt even clean the fridge. Went down to get a new room key since mine wasn‚Äôt working and requested someone be sent up to clean the fridge and someone came up to replace the fridge because they thought that‚Äôs what I requested. A little disappointed that we paid a decent amount to stay in such a nice hotel only for the cleanliness of it to be questioned. Overall the hotel wasn‚Äôt bad at all.
50,This is a beautiful hotel and more than that it‚Äôs a beautiful compound filled with high end dining high end shopping and making a phenomenal experience  The service is unparalleled  The cost now is very reasonable and making it best value on the strip
50,"Overall everything is great except ""Hidden Charges"" which they never mentions on the site. The hotel charged me $51 for every night as a resort fee. I already paid an hefty amount to book a room for 5 nights and also checked out the previous day of my checkout date still I was charged $255 on top of my stay. This was very annoying."
30,We recently stayed at caesar's for new years for 3 nights. We stayed in an Augustus room because i heard their basic rooms were less than desirable. Although the room was very nice the bed and pillows were really uncomfortable. The worst we have experienced in vegas. We also paid $85 to check in early but our luggage didnt arrive from the bell desk in time so we actually had to go to our 5:30 dinner reservations at prime in our airplane clothes. I was honestly suprised they let me in as i was in jeans and a hoodie. However if i would've waited we would've missed our reservations. Also on our last day housekeeping didnt come. I called and asked why and the woman at the front desk claimed we said no housekeeping service at check in which was a lie. When i asked why they came the previous two days she didn't have an answer and said housekeeping was gone for the day at 445 pm. My husband called back and she said housekeeping was actually there until 5 and he told her to have them come up which they did. The casino was also packed and we were uncomfortable. The casino was allowing anyone to come in not just hotel guests. We were pretty unhappy with this and decided to stay in our room for nye night as it didnt feel safe. This was our first trip to caesars but my 16th trip in total to Vegas. Although it is a beautiful place i most likely won't be back. The service room and overall experience was much better at the Bellagio. The bellagio was also giving out bellagio masks and had dividers put in for table games. Caesars didnt do either of those things. Super disappointing. Just shows that the bellagio is the best.
50,It was a wonderful time but need to open the Sauna and need to have No smoking but it was a good time would love to be back see you all next time we are going to be back in February and July if we can get a Discount
10,We stayed in the Augustus tower in room 2395 for 4 days. The Flooded hallway near the ice machine was left uncleaned and smelled like mold.  Self park is too far away from hotel. Rooms don't have a free refrigerator for use.
10,This was the worst experience ever. Charged full resort price and all shows were canceled pool was shut down. I gambled for 3 nights and never once did a server come to me for a drink order. F*** Ceasars palace
30,This trip was not great. We had a lot of employees not willing to assist during the check in process. The wait time was very high & unpleasant. The room service was not available. The Starbucks & other food locations had higher prices & very long lines. We won‚Äôt be staying here in the future.
30,Family of 4 for breakfast for $175 for eggs and pancakes. I expect to pay a bit more than normal but that is ripping people off. The rooms were average with good cleaning service. The restaurants were way overpriced. The only restaurant worth the money was Hell‚Äôs Kitchen.
50,Out of the many shops you can walk through and experience this one is a personal favorite. There‚Äôs a great range of things you can buy here and the staff are all incredibly nice. They also have an extravagant Christmas tree set up for the holidays.    The rooms are definitely worth your stay and this hotel has one of my favorite buffets. I would highly recommend spending time here.
10,I am pro mask for my safety and others. However when I pull down my mask for a second to drink my coffee and get asked to wear my mask while a person next to me has their mask down smoking a cigarette there is something wrong with that! Ok so if i am smoker I can have my mask down and pump carcinogenics into the air killing me! Smoking kills more people than Covid will ever but smokers can sit smoking a cigarette without their masks on?  This is because smokers bring in the money. Money is worth more than lives.  I was approached three times about eating a bagel. Don‚Äôt eat smoke! Stupid. What are we doing here? There is no common sense to these rules!
30,For starters the bed is too tall but big problem is toilet is mounted closes to wrong wall and did not have a open front toilet seat. This forced me to have to use bathroom in lobby. Just adding this part in because they are forces us to write more. Don't touch the room bar until you check the prices.
20,"Poor customer service no concierge to help navigate what is open and what is closed. We didn't get the room we booked and we were given some story of getting a ""free"" upgrade to 2 Queen beds .I did call ahead and let them know our plane was getting in later than we thought. Poor information on the app about restaurants that were closed on the property. We went to find 3 different restaurants that were supposedly open and found to be closed.."
10,Hello all please be aware of the big names do not book or stay in this resort Im telling you this from my experience their customers service and management totally sucks and all have an attitude bad attitude from the cleaning staff all the way to management kind of rude  Do not book via third party if you want to stay in this place you must call them directly and make sure you get everything you need and agreeable before you reserve  Service sucks  Rooms all dusty and not clean at all  They lied to much they said because of Covid we don‚Äôt clean room which is make things worst if you think you want to choose this place  Sometimes they said we only clean in the early mooring when they clean they don‚Äôt vacuum or change sheets unless you tell them if you ask for towels they said it‚Äôs going to cost you money because Covid  They don‚Äôt over any hospitality no water nothing even if you pay top dollar for nasty room conditions  My advice if you want to choose where you want to book go for cosmopolitan casino Bellagio aria casino hotel and or Paris  They are way better and much cleaner than nasty Cesar  Be aware when you check out they try to steel your money the mini bar lady comes every day check the inventory still when you check out they trying to charge room service every day we asked them what is this for different amount every day they keep answering you nonsense answer after all they tell you this is mini bar which we never used
10,We recently stayed at Caesars and the room was dirty!!! Whatever they advertise about their COVID protocol didn't see any of that! There's hair in the bathroom dusty room dirty room and a/c didn't work most of the time.    The hotel is very busy and lots of people. Took about 40 mins in line to check-in. During our stay the line was always long except in the early morning. There's a long wait when you call guest service.    I did mention this in the front desk manager. He didn't really care. He was arrogant and told me to call corporate. I don't recommend this place. Moved to Aria and had a better stay. The room was clean and door had a security sticker and they provided personal mask and hand sanitizer for their guest and shield. Nothing like that at the caesars.
10,Room was dirty hair in the bathroom AC didn‚Äôt work elevators didn‚Äôt work got locked out of the room for 2 hours hidden fees for everything poor quality rooms. Customer service sucked . I would not stay here again for sure . Very disappointed
20,I unfortunately don‚Äôt have photos but our room had dirty shoe prints and hair on the floor and dried vomit on the walls. I asked them to clean and told them of the specific things I saw and it was still there when we came back in the evening. This is very worrisome especially when traveling during COVID. I‚Äôm not sure if less attention was given because we used rewards and didn‚Äôt pay for our room through the hotel.
30,I must say the rooms are clean and spacious. I thought I was getting a garden view but I got a parking lot view. The pool is closed since November they said. There‚Äôs a coffee maker in the room but there‚Äôs no tea or coffee pods. I called guest services and they said there‚Äôs a charge if we want a bag of tea. What in the world we‚Äôre paying a resort fee that expensive when the pool is closed and no coffee pods or water or whatsoever! So dissapointed.
10,I travel to very often for work. This happened to be a family vacation trip. I haven‚Äôt yet stayed at a hotel that ia high end and didn‚Äôt include coffee?? Really? I was charged $22 for opening the coffee bag. UNBELIEVABLE. Also there was no dirty clothes bag or trash bag anywhere in the room or a fridge. Which I didn‚Äôt Expect but it would‚Äôve been nice. Im most disappointed about the overcharged coffee bag. Lastly the wait line to check in was hours long.
50,We loved our stay at Caesar‚Äôs Palace! The room was nice staff was nice! Eric at the front desk and Christine at the Caesar Rewards desk were especially attentive and went above and beyond to help. Overall great stay!
50,The Grande Dame of the Strip doesn't show her age as the property remains clean renovated and fastidiously well-kept. Our room was spacious comfortable well-appointed with a view of the Strip from two sides and a quiet calm refuge from the bustle of the casino. Checking in and out was easy and fast with multiple options including the express self-check-in feature. Cocktail service in the casino was excellent and it didn't hurt that we won a little bit. An overall enjoyable satisfying experience that is recommendable for those who appreciate quality.
30,üëé no respect  Not good for money we paidthe other casino way to cheap and way better service  Never going to stay here again and I‚Äôm going to share this with all my people  Terrible service can‚Äôt believe
50,CP was amazing! The cleanliness was outstanding and room service was great!  Food was sent up in a timely manner and with the highest quality of food you could have. Check in was super easy to with kiosk available when you walk in! Bathtubs are out of this world with great lotions and shampoos to use.
50,Caesars never fails to deliver excellence and a great time! Many of the employees I‚Äôve seen there for years including Austin at the front desk who I met in the Diamond Lounge previously then as a host. He is the epitome of what Caesars is about. Professional Personable and remembers you as a customer.
30,I was very excited for my trip since it was my 1st Vegas trip the city did live Upto it but creaser's terribly failed to meet any of it.    1- PATHETIC FRONT DESK SERVICES AND RUDE STAFF:  a. I had to wait for an hour till I got my turn to check-in the booked category of room wasn't provided to me and a dark long corner back facing room was provided which was almost 1 mile walk from front desk.  b. We requested a room change immediately then had to again get into a line at check-in desk where after spending 1 more hour they agreed to change our rooms from next day to a better floor and tower.  c. We were not sent the new room keys and had to again fall in line for the complete check-in process again spending more than an hour. The staff at front desk is so rude and disrespectful and straight away refused to offer any help until we fall in line for complete process.    2- USELESS F&B Credits: $75 seemed to be a shear waste to me as there are very limited vegetarian food options at the hotel the In room dining is a nightmare ordered a vegetarian meal from Bejeing 9 (In house restaurant) and they sent a non-vegetarian soup. Upon complaining the front desk staff refused to help and asked us to contact the restaurant directly. At the checkout with some food credits left we requested to keep the F&B credits active at-least for that day but they immediately forfeited them despite confirming they will not and again had to do hour long discussion for getting it re-activated for use.    The location is really good right at the strip parking is free for in-house guests casino is fantastic especially the amazing POKER room staff but hospitality wise would never recommend this hotel to anyone. The rooms are quite old and traditionally built to depict Greek theme but nothing fancy about it. The front desk is useless and the call helpline is like any other call center where you need to wait for 10-15 minutes to get any kind of support. The mini bar refrigerator is blocked for use and censor enabled you can't use it cool any of your personal items else they would charge you a fee without even using anything. For everything they would ask you about the booking source if it's a third party website(prestigia in my case) they would start treating you with less priority and explicitly refuse help with that reason.    I am not satisfied with the amount paid and quality of services offered and would like a refund for resort fee paid on daily basis.
30,Overly crowded. Long wait incoming in line. No water given and there is additional resort fee for nothing. Smoke smell everywhere in the casino. The room chairs were dirty and the bathroom mirrors. Atleast give some water for the additinal fees charged every night. restaurants all throughout hotel and mall inside as well. Pools were closed. Smoke smell everywhere in the hotel.
40,Overall great stay. But had an incident where the housekeeping staff left a half eaten peanut bar in our room after ‚Äúcleaning‚Äù. Vegas is mask mandatory. This means the staff member was in our room without a mask eating and then left the half eaten bar behind. It would have been disgusting during normal circumstances but given Covid it made us feel as though our space was violated. And to make matters worse when I reported the incident I was offered a $25 credit to eat at one of their restaurants.
50,Christmas at Caesar's Palace 2020 was great. Good food. High tech menus. Winning on games. And rates were fantastic. Ran 5 miles in the workout gym this morning. Don't worry about Covid here. Safe safe safe.
20,Very disappointed in this resort. We go to Vegas quite a bit and finally decided to try Caesar's Palace and would never stay there again. As a Seven Star member of Caesar's Entertainment they offered us nothing. Can't believe they have a coffee pot in the room and coffee but if you use the coffee you are charged for it. None of the other Caesar's properties we stay at in Vegas do this. The staff was not very friendly either. My husband had a problem with his Reward Credit points and twice the Executive Host office said it would be taken care of but it never was. Food was overpriced. Sorry we stayed there.
50,We had a very wonderful experience at Caesar's Palace with a breathtaking view in Augustus Tower facing the iconic replica of Eiffel Tower the globe of Paris amazing city lights and ofcourse the one of a kind show of Bellagio Fountain. We had our 3 day trip and going back to our room enjoying Jacuzzi after all day of wonderful exploration is just so amazing. This is all thanks to Raphie from front desk he made our stay absolutely worthwhile. Thank you Raphie! Definitely not all things happen in vegas stays in vegas our experience here is worth sharing to my friends and people I know. Thanks to linda/lydia from front desk and from bell desk department daniel as well as Isiah. Thank you so much for your great service. Surely we will be back soon.
50,I know how stressful this job can be and especially during this pandemic so I wanted to make sure he got the recognition he deserves for his coolness and grace. My first experience in Las Vegas at Caesar's Palace was excellent because of the staff. Thank you all and have a happy holiday.
40,Awesome hotel !!! Very professional associates that care about the customer! I wish I had more time to stay plus wish more money to spend lol! I‚Äôm glad that the hotel Practice social distancing an very tight security!
10,No valet parking full  They make you wait then finally ask if you are diamond member  If you say no then they will tell you parking is full  Impossible to check in 1 hr  Rooms outdated  Coffee maker not working but they will immediately charge for coffee supplies  No prices disclosed on items left in room like coffee and water
20,My visit was not as I expected. When I made the reservation over the phone I was quoted a different price then I actually got. My total was double the amount I agreed to hidden fees and service I was never told about. The rooms were not as clean as before especially during these difficult times with the pandemic and Heath crises
40,If I had any complaints it would be the fact there was not any fridge space which was a little annoying. The bed covers could of been softer. They felt quite rough. The tub was nice but very slippery when getting out.
50,Parking was easy to find. Mr. Delano was very helpful making the checkin and checkout process go smoothly. The room was clean and spacious as well as the bathroom. The beds were comfortable and I slept well. Just be aware of the mini bar ensuring not to remove anything because you‚Äôll be charged just for moving it lol......also don‚Äôt store anything or you‚Äôll be charged. Be aware of hidden fees in regards to that. Other than that I didn‚Äôt have any issue.
50,First of all when I checked into the hotel around 10:20 am. I was kind of unsure if my room was ready for check in. I was greeted by Team Member Mr. Delano and he was very helpful with the check in. He was able to get me an early check in and complimentary room upgrade to the Augustus Tower without any extra fees!
50,We checked in with Maria S. and she was so wonderful! Our check in was on 12/9 and our room in the Augustus Tower was absolutely lovely with a view from the 27th floor. The elevators are so quick! The COVID information was very plain in all public areas.    Honestly this is the best hotel!
10,Horrible customer service. They allowed a raging party in the suite next-door that clearly had dozens of people in the room during a time when the city is under strict Covid restrictions. I had to call down to the front desk and security six times before it finally quieted down and they evicted the party. And then they refused to comp my room even though it kept me up till 1 AM in a room with my 76-year-old mother. They had absolutely no concern for what we have been put through and were very rude l including the front desk manager that I was eventually able to talk to. Don‚Äôt stay at this hotel.
10,We didn‚Äôt not feel safe in our room we stood in our bathroom cups were not clean they have lipstick on the rim of the glass and turned over like if they didn‚Äôt check them when they cleaned the room and our refrigerator had old food in it & open liquor left in there during covid you would think they clean extra good but nope manager came took pictures of it and said they reach out to us but still haven‚Äôt heard from them this will be the last time we stay here!!!
40,Great location very pleasant and really clean. We would stay here again. The only thing to watch for is the ‚Äúrefreshments ‚Äú in the refrigerator if you use it for your food. You must be certain you put everything back in the same place.
50,The family came for a getaway to celebrate our anniversary and Dany was accommodating and went above and beyond to make it super special. He helped me find connecting rooms and upgraded us. We will definitely be back to visit. Thank you Dany you are the best customer service representative ever!
30,"We were able to get away from home for a nice long Vegas stay during Covid. Working from Vegas is very doable and not too pricey in general. We checked in at Caesars on a Thursday after staying at Vdara. It was noticeably dead which is why we like coming around Xmas but it was slower than previous years for obvious reasons.    I have to say that I was very disappointed with the room we got. We were there on a three-day comp booked in a Julius Tower room. I asked about upgrades complimentary or paid and I specified the suites I was interested in. In particular I asked about the Premier Spa Suite and the Premier Suites in the Palace Augustus or Octavius suites in that order. Let me be clear that the check-in agent was very nice and polite and was really trying to help. I just think she had zero power to do anything. I should also mention that we were checking in in the diamond/7-stars area. We are diamond. Also for those 20 tip trick folks out there I tipped $50.    The response I got was that they could upgrade me for $200 more per night. Hmmm. That seemed too high. I said I was willing to do $150/nt and the agent excused herself to go to the back to speak with a manager I assume. After 10 mins or so she returned and said sorry but no. This was surprising given that I got a Penthouse Suite on the 56th floor of Vdara facing the Bellagio fountains for $99/nt. It was the best view I've ever had in Vegas. Amazing. I also had a comp there so it was $99 more. In this trip I also checked in at the Venetian on a comp and they upgraded us to a Grand One Bedroom Suite on the 35th floor with an amazing strip view for just $120/nt and they also gave a $50 amex card for spend at the property. It's a huge beautiful suite with a great wet bar and amazing bathroom. Finally we're going to Bellagio next where I booked a huge Cypress Suite right in the rounded center spine of the main tower facing the fountains for $145/nt. That wasn't a comp. That was just the price I booked.    So three other hotels offered amazing suites and views for less than $145/nt but Caesars wouldn't budge. Extremely disappointing especially given that the check-in agent acknowledged that they had plenty of the Premier suites available.    So I declined... I was offered an upgrade to a 750sqft ""suite"" for $100/nt but for those of you that know that's the standard size of the Augustus Tower rooms - at least near the elevators. It was not really an upgrade and felt like they were just trying to get more money out of me. Again I politely declined.    So I ended up asking for any complimentary upgrade. I ended up with a Palace Tower room that was smaller than the Augustus rooms but it had an odd set of two very small bathrooms connected by a shower. It was the same price or maybe $10 more per night than the comp I booked.    So to summarize it was dead because of the Holidays and even more so due to covid we checked in at the diamond area they wouldn't accommodate my reasonable request to pay for their suite and we ended up in the same level of room as we booked for our comp even after a $50 tip. Be a Caesar? Not by a long shot... They could have made that $50/nt difference back in 30 mins or less of my slot play. As it stands I have to seriously think about whether I want to gamble at this property. There are many others nearby that will appreciate my business more. I'll lose my status but what is that status really getting me anyway? If they won't accommodate in these times they definitely won't in regular times.    Like I said before I did appreciate the agent's time so I gave her the $50 tip I had on the counter. I believe in showing appreciation and supporting hotel workers in these tough times but for those of you hoping to get an upgrade with the tip trick at Caesars I don't recommend it. (I didn't realize the room was basically the same until after I left check-in).    And a couple of bonus fyi's...  1) My wife needed a hard line connection for her computer due to her company's security policies. I walked back to the diamond desk after noticing that the room didn't have one and I was told that no rooms at Caesars have a hard line connection.  2) MGM tapes the doors shut to show that nobody has been in the room after it was sanitized by housekeeping. Caesars does not. People can be switching rooms - entering to check it out and touch things and then leave - and there's no indication of that. I'm not sure why Caesars wouldn't take this precaution to put their guests at ease."
40,Although food and room is little over priced I enjoyed my stay. I am going to miss this beautiful room. Sheets are a little itchy for me because I have delicate skin. Normally I bring my own sheets to hotel stays. Stayed on the 14th floor. Breath taking view. Decoration and the decor of the casino and lobby was beautiful. First stay we‚Äôll be coming back. With our own sheets lol.
20,Really poor experience. Wont be returning. Front desk agents trying to upsell instead of helping with basic requests. Talked down to. Wouldn‚Äôt accommodate my non smoking room that reeked of smoke. Poor sleep.
40,I rated 4/5 because while the hotel is beautiful and the view from my room was spectacular my money was stolen from my room. There was a 2 hour window where we left the room and the only ones believed to have access was housekeeping. I can't say for sure but the evidence leaves me to believe that they may need to screen their housekeeping staff a bit more.
20,Let‚Äôs start by saying that Caesars‚Äôs makes all shuttles drop you off in the back. So we drug our luggage about a 1/4 of a mile through the hotel to get to registration. They have early check in for an extra $75. If you booked outside of Caesars such as Expedia or Southwest Vacations they will tack on another $50 a night in resort fees. Our friend had one day waived because the jets in her tub didn‚Äôt work. You can‚Äôt use the fridge in the room for your own items or they charge you a restocking fee of $75. There is no complimentary coffee or water. Not everything is open so the lines are long in the morning if you want coffee at the hotel Starbucks. Nearly everything is reservation only if it‚Äôs even open. You would think they would be appreciative of tourists coming since a lot just reopened but it appears they are trying to make up for lost revenue. If you only want to gamble now is a great time to go. If you want to see shows you‚Äôll be disappointed. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable but I can get that at most hotels in Vegas. We won‚Äôt return.
30,Spacious room with a comfortable bed and modern looking corner sofa. The bathroom is large with a deep jetted soaker tub and good water pressure in the shower and tub.  The bad...There were dirty clothes and cosmetics left in some of the drawers. Some of the walls looked dirty. The room didn‚Äôt look all that clean so I wiped down all the hard surfaces myself with disinfectant wipes. There is a ridiculous $75 charge if you put anything in the mini fridge. There is a Keurig in the room but the K-cups are not free. Something like $14 for 4 of them. Save yourself some money and bring your own. Also watch your hotel bill. I had a mini bar charge for something I didn‚Äôt remove. They try to nickel and dime for everything!
10,Rooms were disgusting. Old and run down. Knobs were falling off the drawers. Showers were molded and mildew in grout lines. Parking lot is a mile from your room. Virtual check in wouldn‚Äôt work. Took Almost a hour to get checked in.
10,Prior to the merger with El Dorado resorts this property was quite lousy‚Ä¶ It has a gotten much worseIn the last several months. Absolutely no services offered with the most snarky staff I have ever encountered. Too much to list here do not bother.
40,I stayed at ceasars palace for 1 night with very high expectations because it‚Äôs ceasars palace. The room was huge and clean and so as the bathroom. Just got disappointed with the towels in the bathroom as it‚Äôs all off white and old..dunno if that‚Äôs the real color of that or because it‚Äôs been overused. But overall i enjoyed my stay and had fun in Vegas. Thank you Ceasars Palace!
20,"So this happened  After doing a lot of research on rooms at at the Caesars Palace we booked a premium room in the Octavius tower. (Yes we paid extra for it).  - Upon check in we were put in a Tower room. It was very nice but not the one we had booked.  - Extremely long lines and unfriendly staff. I was quite disappointed by how unhelpful and unfriendly the staff were. They seemed irritated that you asked them a question - as simple as what was open and where we could eat. They told us to download an app and look it up.  - Room was clean and beautiful. No complaints BUT - and this is a big one. You get NOTHING. I mean NOTHING except the room. There is a minifridge in the room but you get charged $75 for ""personal use"" of the minifridge. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! A high end hotel that nickels and dimes you to death. AWFUL. They should be ashamed.  - They had a Keurig in the room and three paper cups for that. We had brought our own coffee pods we like. The next day they took away the three cups and left nothing so we couldn't even make ourselves a cup of coffee. VERY FRUSTRATING.  - NO RATES on anything in the room. There are lots of snack minibar stocked and coffee ""packages"" in the room. YOU are CHARGED for anything and everything you touch of course with NO PRICES listed anywhere. That is so dishonest. Very frustrating again.  - We were charged a $50 per night ""Resort Fee"" but there were no resort amenities open due to covid. I understand needing to close things due to the virus but then don't 'steal' from the customers without giving them anything for the ridiculous ""resort fee"" What the heck.  (Of course it did not help that I forgot my diamond ring in the hotel room. Needless to say it was never 'found'. Of course not.)  I WILL NOT stay there again. I'm sure there are plenty of options. Caesars is not a friendly helpful or good option."
50,I had a last minute trip to go to Las Vegas I had my concerns due to Covid-19 so needless to say I was nervous. From the time I pulled up to valet parking the kind open employees took great care of me I felt like my room was well cleaned prior to getting there I placed my room on private for my full stay. Then I was given an opportunity for an extra day at a great rate and last I as able to check-out from my room.
40,Parking was horrible due to far distance. Room was appeared clean but was dirty due to lots of hair in shower & stains on comforter. Cessers sent cleaner to fix issue that morning & apologize. No complimentary parking after checkout.
30,The request for room service went ignored. The concierge didn‚Äôt answer emails and when we did call a phone number they forward us to Ticketmaster. Show tickets purchased were canceled w/no explanation.
10,They didn't let me check into my penthouses until 8pm that I payed thousands of dollars for. They barely compensated me for not having my room ready (they only waved the resorts fees). The penthouses had stains all over the carpets. The room had zero amenities there wasn't even a bottle of water to be found in any of the four rooms or main room. When the music and tv wasn't working I tried calling the front desk at least six times and didn't get someone up to my room to fix until 4 hours after the first call when I finally walked down to the front desk and asked in person. Overall I would never stay at Caesar's Palace again and recommend staying at any hotel on the strip other than this one.
20,If you want coffee in your room their is a packet for $13. per day Can't use little refer if you needed it for medication or left over dinner. It's only for their snacks. there is a sign on it saying if you use it cost is $75. Never enough towels. Had to call for more. Resort fee (over and above room fee) $51 a day. Got nothing for it. No pool or spa. free wifi big deal! Would never stay here again!
10,Over 11/20 a group of us took a much needed getaway. Me and my partner got in around 10 PM on the Friday. Our check in went well when get got to the room it seems someone laid on the bed we had to go back to front desk. The manager was pretty good apologize profusely and upgraded us. The next day our friends called to meet them at the American in Caesar for breakfast. I was running late I ran out and left my bracelet on the dresser in my room. At breakfast I mentioned to my friends oh I left my bracelet I have to go get it and they said no need and not to worry since this was a high place. We left and did tourists things and I came back later in the day. I searched that room up and down the only other person(s) that entered the room was maid service. Right away I went to the front desk I spoke with a manager who told me that I have to go to the security desk and make a report which I did. I found the manager response to be matter of fact and never called the Las Vegas police department since this is larceny case. I was devastated traumatized and felt my personal space was violated. I am now paranoid because I felt that at anytime someone can rumaged through my things. By late that night after not receiving any calls from Caesar's staff to tell me the next steps I called downstairs and spoke with their operations manager Nate. He gave me the speech that they take these things seriously. I knew that it's not true since I was the one who kept following up. The Sunday before I leave on Monday I went back and ask for the manager who was Nate because I wanted to know which everything stood. He told me that I had to go to security desk to check. I went over there and the security person said he did not understand why Nate sent me there he knows that he is the one to provide updates. While I was at the desk another gentlemen was there very irate about a theft. I lost it and went back to front desk and demanded to speak to Nate he was not going to come out but I said enough of this I wanted the General Manager contact information. He then showed up and tried to calm me down by telling me his security people was looking into this which was a bunch of crap. I came home the Monday and as tired I research got the GM information and sent a detail email about my experience and I called the Las Vegas Police Department and opened a case. Nate called me with an update after a few back and forth he called me to say that the security team finished their research and could not come up with any clues and Caesar's was not liable however they can give me $750 as a customer relationship offer. I told him that was an insult for place like Caesar a casino with all those cameras not to find out what happen and your place has a theft problem. I sent a follow up and another manager called me. She also offer the $750 and a stay I told her you got to be kidding me and I said how insensitive she was to even tell me about a stay and I am not taking this Caesar needs to REPLACE my bracelte. To date this matter is still unresolved and I am decided my next options. I am going to tell my story to who will listen because I DO NOT want someone to go through and fell how I did.
10,We have been customers of Caesars for 17 years. Over the last several they have been in a downward spiral. This will be our last visit to Caesars Las Vegas.    Our room was outdated tired and in disrepair. Broken toilet paper holder paint chipped on walls and baseboards clothing drawers were chipped carpet was worm and torn. When we called we were told that in order to get another room it would be an upgrade. Wow.    An added bonus was how horrible they handled ANY situation. Casino bonuses room credits and removing incorrect charges all took 2-3 calls to get resolved. The staff appears to be poorly trained. And to top it all off I changed credit cards at checkin and they used the wrong credit card.
10,"I had to go to Las Vegas for business recently. For many years I've only stayed at MGM properties because of comps but I had not been to Las Vegas in a very long time and wanted to try somewhere different. It turned out to be a nightmare.    I had my wallet and phone stolen in the hotel. I might have possibly been drugged as well. I'm not a careless person and this has never happened to me in Las Vegas or anywhere in the world for that matter before. I'm not leaving a bad review for the fact that this happened necessarily but for how I was treated afterwards. Security was polite but not terribly interested in what happened. No offer at all to check video cameras they just acted like this kind of thing happens all the time. You would think at least they would want to see the face of who did this so they could bar them from the casino and hotel. I had my laptop still in my room and I could see they had tried to use one credit card several times and my bank card but not the other credit cards so far. I wanted to of course put a hold on all of my credit cards but I needed the one I put my room on to clear so I went down to front desk to explain what happened and that I would leave this card valid for now. She offered to charge my room right then and there and then when it went through she had a big smile and said ok we're good! I said ok great but is there anyway I can still get food charges on my room they ask for ID when I want to charge it there. And she just smiled and said oh you need ID to charge things to your room smiled and left. Seriously? SERIOUSLY?? I had just explained my wallet was stolen. I'm stuck in a different city with no ID credit cards or bank card or any cash to eat or to even buy gas to get home and this ""luxury resort"" could not give a single care.    I had to use the room phone to call my bank to get them to give me some cash without ID. For that call to an 800 number I was charged 30 something dollars on my bill. Valet parking costs 30 a day. The resort fee costs almost as much as the room. Food and drinks are ridiculously priced. After I got some cash from my bank finally I packed and left even though I had another night booked. 2.5 days in this place costs me about $1500 in room and meals and fees and I get treated like garbage. I will never step foot in this dump again. I seriously advise to avoid it at all costs. I hate to say it but its just not safe and they don't care for their customers in the slightest."
10,My father and I checked in to Caesar‚Äôs in dec 2020. This has been the worse check in process I‚Äôve experienced. The check in took more than 30 minutes with the person not even counting the line. They charged our card 3 times and blocked it. Unprofessional people! They were not accommodating to requests and the room we were given had broken lamp and a clogged sink. It wasn‚Äôt even vacuumed. There were pieces of pepperoni on the floor. I don‚Äôt expect to see these at a four star hotel. We‚Äôve stayed at Venetian before. I‚Äôd go back there in a heart beat. Won‚Äôt be coming back to this place ever. I‚Äôd recommend you save yourselves from the hassle I went through and book somewhere else.
10,Check-in process took over an hour. Took another hour for them to get our bags to the room. Paid all this money for an upgraded room and it didn't even have a mini fridge. Only their stocked mini fridge with incredibly over priced items. I removed a few items and set aside so that I had room for a six pack of my own drinks. Then returned their items before checkout. I was charged over $275 after checkout. Everything I touched they charged me for. The only nice thing I can say is that the beds were incredibly comfortable.
50,My birthday trip the suite is perfect and the staff is tip too in this time that we are in the social distancing and safety measures are great everything is amazing I highly recommend this property!!!
30,Caesars is a beautiful resort. The rooms are amazing. Gave it 3 stars because of miscommunication and lack of information. There are no information guides in the room. They do not provide a refrigerator and if you open and use the one there they charge you $75. They have a coffee pot but you have to pay $25 for 4 pods. No coffee cups provided. The room bar is full and if you even touch the items they charge you for them! I was just checking to see what they had! There is no concierge on duty and not one phone number you can call for help or information. Security is not very good on the casino floor either. My girlfriends and I were approached and even accosted several times by sketchy individuals and no security ever to be found. The food drink and snack prices are ridiculous!
50,"Our room was beautiful and all the places we ate inside the hotel were awesome. It was a bit expensive and we were not able to enjoy all the amenities such as the spa and massage treatments and the restaurants and bars were super expensive. I only had one bad thing happen. I was at the ATM and two security personnel were walking by and I asked for directions. As the male officer was talking I glanced at the ATM machine to retrieve my receipt and he said ""if you'd pay attention to what I'm saying."" Kind of berating me as if I was a child not paying attentions."
40,My wife and I travel to Vegas every other month for a 4 night get-away. In one word its very Classy. The hotel staff has always been wonderful to us. the forum has great shopping the casino floor is fun and the pools are awesome. My watch noticed that I was walking around 5 miles everyday because its a big place. We just returned and would like to share what covid has changed. There was no room service the whole time we were there you have to request anything you need and they send it up. Most the dinning options were closed including the buffets but pick up and delivery was available. The pools were closed till March and many of the stores were open only on the weekend. One negative note is stay clear of Gordan Ramsay it's a terrible disappointment.
20,"I frequent Vegas often and unfortunately this was the worst stay I've ever had. I had wanted to stay at Caesars for a long time and an impromptu trip and low nightly rates finally made that possible. I stayed in the Palace Tower and room was beautiful bed super comfortable. The snack bar had an opened bag of cookies on it so I called the front desk to make them aware so I wasn't charged. The customer service person I spoke with was friendly and made a note to the account. I was not feeling well from my travels (stomach stuff not Covid) so I didn't get out and about for fun as I had planned. Instead I went to bed early. Then around 12:30 a.m. the neighbors in the connecting room next door starting getting loud laughing talking loudly and playing rap music. I could literally hear every word at most times. After an hour of hoping they would settle down or leave I spoke to security who said they would send someone up. They never did. The party next door left for little over an hour and returned around 2:00 a.m. I woke up again and feeling just terrible I called security again. They again said they would ""be right up"" to address the noisy neighbors but never did. I even resorted to earplugs and pulled the covers over my head. Eventually I got an hour sleep but was awaken by laughter until they finally got quiet around 6:30 a.m. By that point I had had enough took a shower and drove the 6 hours home."
10,"I have travelled quite a bit around the world and the US and this was the WORST experience I have ever had in a hotel. It started with the check-in. I am a Caesars Diamond Member and I went to the check-in reserved for Diamond and Seven Seas members. After standing in line for over 45 minutes and having the staff take 8 Seven Seas members ahead of the lowly Diamond members I said something and was met with the ""Seven Seas members come first blah blah blah."" Every other property I have been too switches back and forth between levels - not this one. At that point I went to the regular front desk and was checked in within 10 minutes. An hour wasted of my time. The room was nice but I couldn't help but notice the in-room coffee maker was gone and the wallpaper was peeling by the tub in the bathroom and the STENCH of smoke that met us when we walked in our NON SMOKING room. When I go into any hotel room I check the closet the drawers in the nightstands and the dresser. In the nightstand I found an ashtray with cigarette butts in it empty cigarette packages and a water bottle of cigarette butts. I threw it in the trash and left the ashtray on the table.    That night we went to dinner at Old Homestead Steakhouse and the waiter started talking about CA politics. Not exactly what I wanted to hear when having a romantic dinner with my husband. The next morning we went to order Room Service for breakfast and found out that they have discontinued room service due to COVID. However you could order breakfast from one of the restaurants and get dressed and go pick it up. Didn't make any sense to me than and still doesn't. What happened to contactless delivery? We ended up checking out early and going to breakfast before leaving town to head home and that is where it absolutely gets more interesting.    A few days after arriving home I checked my credit card account and found an additional charge of $300 from Caesars on my account. We had already been charged for the incidentals so I was curious what this charge was for. After several calls to the billing department I found out it was a smoking in the room charge and a charge for damage done to a bathroom door. We are both NON-SMOKERS but were being charged for someone else. We are in our late 50s and we didn't even touch the bathroom doors so now we are being charged a fee for damage and smoking in the room. The front desk manager Evander said the charge stands and that they have pictures. Great. How about sharing them with me or listening to a long standing Diamond member? (It has been disputed with my credit card company).    Overall I will never return to Caesars Palace and am debating about cutting up my Diamond card and going back to MGM and their properties and Caesars can pound sand. Like I said worst hotel experience I have ever had and I am a frequent traveller."
20,"Paying top dollars for this hotel and not having the basic needs for a customer is a disappointment.    1- The self parking lot is across the state from where my room was given ""Octavius"". even though it was my anniversary with my wife i was given the farthest tower/room possible to make my stay unpleasant.  2- The room gives you a fridge full of mini bar drinks(which they charge and if you remove 1 item you will be charged for it but they do not provide you with one to keep your water cold. You are instead provided with a ice machine that is located in the same floor across the state.  3- I requested on 2 occasions missing towels shampoo and cups for coffee. I never got my requested items.    This alone will keep me from ever coming back here and They have the audacity to charge you $51 for hotel resort fees."
50,Upon check in Eric suggested I request an upgrade from on of the hosts so he called and we got upgraded to a 1300 sq/ft suite. It was an amazing experience for this Seven Stars member. I'm a big fan of not only Caesars Place but all Caesars Rewards properties.
30,We were very excited to stay at Ceaser's Palace for the weekend. The only downfall we had was the room. It was outdated. Old lamps and CD player. The self parking is far from lobby check in. We loved the location everything was close.
20,Our stay was for 11/28/20 to be for 3 nights.We left after being there only 2 hours because we were so upset with how Caesar‚Äôs treated us. Therefore we left without even staying the first night. Wynns told us to just checkout and they would give us a $350 food credit. Best move we ever made! No one cares or even knows what‚Äôs going on over there. The host that evening said it was too late to fix there error. You would think they would try to help with there mistakes in these trying times. What does Diamond level get us? Apparently nothing!
10,I can mark this off my bucket list of things to do. The only thing that I liked about this place was how comfy their beds are! THATS IT!!!! We got over charged on everything! 10 bucks for a water bottle. Their customer service is ridiculous rude. Stay far away from valet parking! Karen the short little lady in parking/valet is the rudest person I know. Not only was she rude. But as we waited for our truck I look over at her and she is talking crap about myself and my husband and what had just taken place to 2 other employees. Not just that but she has 0 % customer service qualities. Than we get back to the hotel and they messed up on our rooms and didn‚Äôt give us the right rooms that we paid for! On top of that they over charged us 429 bucks! Which I‚Äôm still waiting on my refund. Than to top it all off. Their cleaning service stole my casino vouchers. Was totaling in 50 bucks! This place is so ridiculous! So what sealed the deal for me was the limo driver that we had asked how our stay was going at caesars palace. We just laughed and said you don‚Äôt even want to know. These were his exact words.....    ‚ÄúAvoid that place like the plague!‚Äù  He has lived in Vegas for 15 years. He has never heard of a good experience. He told us other places to try out. So with all this being said! I not only hope that this place goes out of business  but I hope Karen gets fired ! She is a horrible employee!! If she is still working there that shows you want kind of BS they allow and don‚Äôt care!
30,Very bad staying experience. During my stay the valet charged me $30 for using the valet service which I didn't even drive a car or used the service! Somebody must used name my room number or lied to them or there's some system errors.  Called guest service AND valet team multiple times during my stay after I found out about the unknown charge and at beginning they said there was an error they will remove the charge. But after I checked out from the hotel I received another notice from them stated I used the valet service so I have to pay for that.  Called guest service manager again and he said they can't do anything about it since the valet manager after investigation decided the charge was valid. Called valet team manager multiple times left multiple messages but he never answered his phone or return left message. And guest service manager said I can only dispute this charge with my credit card company if I think it's invalid.  Strongly suggest other people think twice if want to stay at this hotel there are better option and I had better experience with other hotels. Seems like recent management and guest service quality went down by a lot. Even they made mistake they don't apologize or fix the error instead they caused more trouble for customer to file a dispute with their credit card company. Very poor customer service.  Update 11/28:. They called and said will reversed the charge and do further investigation.
50,Always a good time. Covid didn‚Äôt affect our trip. We were very careful and the staff does their best considering all the restrictions in place. I honestly feel bad for the employees and the city as they try to work within the boundaries. We all love coming here so please continue to have the city open! Caesars is an awesome location on the strip. Close to everything. I personally like the Forum tower because it is by the Sports Book. Thanks for allowing us to share more memories here!
50,I stayed at Caesars for a two night stay with my two children for Thanksgiving.. not only is the hotel a exceptional experience the Customer service I received from the team member at the front desk (Gemma) was outstanding not only will I be back to stay but also to hopefully be checked in by her again. They definitely hired the right employees to represent such a elegant place to vacation at. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
20,They do not provide any information. They don‚Äôt know anything you ask. Do not touch anything in the little fridge they will charge you if you put your own water inside. I never though that the so well known Caesar Hotel in Las Vegas would have so little of customer services they can‚Äôt advice about places shows anything. It is like you are on your own. They are not interested in the customer good or excellent stays at all. Need better management. I asked for a manager and he kept looking at a computer display while I was talking about so bad the service is. No education no manners. Definitely I would it not return or recommend this hotel.
10,Not a 4 star hotel! Terribly rude staff and rooms like a tweaked out crack hotel. Stained bed ripped couch scuffed dresser. Front desk staff refused to handle complaint or allow us to speak with management. No coffee pot in room no service whatsoever... I would give a ZERO star
50,Excellent stay and service on this visit. We asked for a room in the Augustus Tower close to the elevator and that is what we got. The room was very large and was very clean. The bed was very comfy. Many channels on the TV. Fast internet. Great dining options in all price ranges. Fantastic views of the Las Vegas Strip. I will return soon and management should be proud.
50,Upon check in front desk staff Eric Wages noticed that it was my birthday when I presented my ID. He proceeded to greet me and decided to treat my husband and I with a room upgrade without any cost. The upgrade was very much appreciated but the service is impeccable. Eric is friendly and very helpful in providing information like hotel amenities and what‚Äôs available during COVID. Thank you Eric.
50,Was assisted by Debyb at VIP check-in. She was very accommodating and helpful. We asked for a different tower than originally booked. Felt safe with COVID safety guidelines. Service is always impeccable from the hosts to the housekeeping staff.
40,"I loved almost everything of my stay at the Caesars Palace the service the reward program and the partnership they have is amazing.    The three things I disliked were:    When I booked my reservation wasn't advised about the $200 USD deposit for incidents it must be paid at the moment of your check-in. S I booked thru a third party site so decided to visit its site and recreated a booking and was the same the incidents fee is not published at the time of booking.    The second thing I disliked was that my tissues were wet on my arrival I realized upto the next day morning the smell was like toilet water so I discarded them.    The third thing was the resort fee vs ""the coverage"". Even that is mandatory you cannot enjoy the pool during the entire year like right now during fall. The internet is limited for two devices even that guests may have more than 2 like tablets cellphone smart watches etc. If you need a third device connection must pay 14.99USD."
20,I have stayed in so many different hotels in Las Vegas and as I was traveling with my daughter decided on Caesar's for a true Vegas experience. Wow the hotel is really in bad shape. First of all there was no valet available so when you park in self-parking you walk about a mile to the check-in. No help at all. Not even carts to help with the luggage. When I asked about it at the front desk the man said that the employee parking lot was very far as well. (Really?). No one seemed to care. Plus the rooms are really dingy! Furniture is thrashed tiles were falling off the bathroom towels were really threadbare. The only reason why I am giving this more than one star was that the woman who checked out with Jeanie was lovely and very helpful when I told her about the mini-bar being used for food. But really Caesar's you should start getting your act together. There are so many other hotels to choose from and from the reviews I see that you are getting people will be taking their business elsewhere.
30,My husband and I stayed at Caesars during the week of Thanksgiving. We have stayed at other hotel/casinos in Vegas in the past and always heard Caesars was a great place to stay. We were not impressed to say the least. First ALL of the staff were so rude! You would think that during a pandemic people would be happy you chose to travel and stay at their hotel. This was not the case at Caesars. The place is so big that you get lost easily and any time we tried to ask for directions or help the staff acted like we were putting them out. Hardly any restaurants were open during our stay and the table game minimums were incredibly high considering the casino was relatively empty. The rooms were nice but that is not enough for me to come stay here again. I would hope that my experience would have been different if we had stayed another time (and not during Covid). However this trip ruined us from returning in the future to find out.
10,Our stay started out positively we were upgraded to a nicer room which was appreciated. Our room was equipped with classic weighted mini bar which I explained to our kids not to touch. The countertop above the bar was also weighted (without any sign indicating this) and we moved the products of drinks and candy to a spot where the kids wouldn‚Äôt touch them. I was subsequently notified through my online room bill that I would be charged over $150 for the snacks. I called the customer service and they chastised me for not knowing the TOP OF THE COUNTERTOP ABOVE the mini fridge was weight based. It took three phone calls to get someone to come up and inspect the room in order to get the charges reversed. The staff kept trying to explain the countertop was weighted but I was more interested in the solution than the problem at that point in time. The manager told me there was ‚Äòno problem‚Äô and the charges would be reversed. I‚Äôm glad he didn‚Äôt think there was a problem but I certainly did. Why was it necessary to chastise me over 45 minutes through three different employees to get the charges reversed? It upset my kids it upset me and left a terrible experience in our memory. An added insult was when the employee came in to inspect the minibar she noted it was missing some Pringle‚Äôs chips which was never there when we entered the room. Caesars palace is running a clear scam with their mini bar service. I didn‚Äôt agree to renting a room with booby traps. I certainly didn‚Äôt agree to renting a room to be treated poorly by the staff. The customer service is greatly lacking to put it mildly and they won‚Äôt receive my business in the future.
10,got message on phone to check in early and no lines.got code on phone- and all done.arrived at hotel-where we check in and get our key?- answer get in line -not such a thing.1.30 hrs in line.overcharged room drinks .last time i was in this hotel.  walter juessen
50,Anthony at the front desk was super helpful and provided wonderful service! Everything was top notch!! We have already decided to stay there again in the future. Staff and guests alike were super nice and helpful. Also you could tell they were cleaning everything extra well due to COVID. Upon request we were brought new towels and toiletries every night. Thanks for memories we won‚Äôt forget during a time that everyone could use a vacation to get away from it all!!
50,Was wonderful and I and my family are very impressed therefore we will come back in the future I will also recommend to my friends and others family them I would like to keep like that for e further trips
50,We had such an amazing vacation stay at Caesars Palace. When me and my husband signed up for the Caesars rewards Teresa assisted us and she was absolutely lovely. Very professional helpful and kind. Will definitely be returning!
10,"We just stayed at this hotel 11/19 to 11/23 (checked out today). I have few problems and have reached out via email unsure if it will get to proper person.    I booked (2) rooms    1. Upon checked in we found out our room was small and it seems like it was not cleaned properly so we went to front desk back to change rooms.  2. Changing rooms I never even heard some kind of ""guest service"" treatment from the front desk all was told they offer an upgrade for $$ and I asked how much and would my rewards points cover it- I was told yes it would cover it.  3. Get ready to pay resort fee even if the wifi is iffy (lagging and does not work when you need it) pool is closed (I called weeks prior and was told it would be open) even if you do not use their fitness or spa (which is closed too).  4. Upon check out and seeing our bill (we are already back in OH) when we saw the bill they have charged my other room resort fee. So I called and asked to speak to manager but the man in the customer service said he can answer what I need so I explained the situation- NEVER did I hear him say apologies for the confusion or try to do anything- NEVER HAVE I TALKED TO A CUSTOMER SERVICE AND BE AS RUDE AS THAT GUY!  5. Casino I only saw a few areas that has hand sanitizers or mask. They do not enforce it as I saw several people walking without one. I have not also seen them wipe down the machines so make sure you bring sanitizers or gloves or wash your hands thoroughly after playing.    I am a total rewards member (was a diamond but now just platinum since I have not been out much). I cannot believe this and I hope that someone would get back to me about this. Customer service is a joke seriously."
10,Just stayed there last night - what a huge disappointment. Caesars Palace had no security - our room was next to a suite. There had to be over 30 people in the room next to us playing loud music until 3 a.m. Called security at 12:30 a.m. - still nothing changed. The people that stayed next to us had 4 or coolers of alcohol. They ended up refunded the resort fee - I asked for a 50% refund given I slept 50% of the night and they wouldn't budge. Their pool wasn't even open. In contrast I stayed at the Venetian a few days prior. They had 3 or 4 security guards at each elevator checking guest's keys. They also provided a nice welcome packet with hand sanitizers and masks - and their pool was open! Never will I stay at CP's again.
50,Due to Abbey‚Äôs outstanding customer service I will continue to patronize Caesar‚Äôs instead of the Wynn. Her superb efficiency and pleasant demeanor has influenced my choice for venues to renew our wedding vows next summer on our 30th wedding anniversary! She deserves a medal for being golden in customer service!
30,Stayed in the Octavius Tower and had a fantastic view of the garden of the gods. Grand bathroom with beautiful lighting. Bed is on the soft side for me. Tried to use the jetted tub the first night and upon turning on the jets some debris came out and floated around the tub. Had to clean it up before using the tub. Room is generally quiet due to it facing the pool but the ventilation system let in noise from downstairs who were playing loud music and singing in the middle of the night. Kudos to security who took care of the situation under half an hour. This tower along with Augustus is a long walk from self parking. Octavius is better than Julius which is the one I stayed last time.
10,When I called to book I Was told the room was new and freshly redone. My bad for believing. Clearly the pictures attached show this room is not new but broken down and filthy. Very disappointed. Katie the manager at Ceasars front desk was no help at all. It was take it or leave it which at that point I felt stuck. Very disappointing.
30,We checked into Caesars Palace for our first visit and the check in was a little rough. We did the Virtual Check In and we were told that if we wanted to check in early it would cost us $50. We decided to wait until around 4:00pm. We called back around 3:30pm and were told we had a room but not the room we had asked for. We were told there was nothing they could do but to come back and get our room. We then went to the front desk and asked again if we could get the room we had requested which was a High Floor. They were very helpful and able to assist and told us we were lucky as we were getting one of the newly refurbished rooms. We also found out when we checked in there was a $50 a day charge for the resort fee and by the way the pool was closed for the season. So we were paying the resort fee for the Local Calls on our Room Phone WIFI (but only on 2 devices per day) and the Fitness Center. Too much if you ask me. When we got up to the room we noticed that the room had definitely not been refurbished in a while by the marks on the walls paint missing and carpet coming up. I was doing some planks in the room and found bottles and food under the couch. Called to have this taken care of and they said they would have the room thoroughly checked. The rest of our stay was pretty non eventful. We made the best of our room and had a great vacation. On the day before check out we asked if we could have the room for 1 extra hour as our flight didn't leave until later that day. They offered to give us the extra hour for $45. We passed. Would we stay here again. Probably not.
30,Was charged an early check in fee twice & when we entered the room it was still dirty. Plastic on the floor behind the couch as well as a used towel on the floor. In a pandemic it‚Äôs even more disgusting. Also a lot of just everywhere.
30,I wish we could have visited Las Vegas before the Covid-19 pandemic because we feel like it definitely had an effect on customer service and the overall vibe at Caesars. When we checked in we were directed to an express check in kiosk where me and my boyfriend entered our reservation info and received our hotel room keys. Since our flight landed in Vegas at 11 am we had to pay a $50 fee to check in early. Maybe the room was cleaned in a rush but when we got to the room the bathroom sink and shower needed to be wiped down. We called the front desk and someone was sent up within 30 minutes to clean and they were able to remove the early check in fee. There were no pamphlets in the room to show us what kind of amenities that the hotel had to offer. Since we didn‚Äôt check in with a human it all felt a little impersonal and like we were left to figure out everything in our own. Because of Covid room service was extremely limited (no food delivery or in-person services but they could bring extra towels etc). The pools and spa were closed too (it was mid November and only 65 degrees but we were hoping to at least be able to use a hot tub). I had even called the week before to see if the pools were open and someone mistakenly told me they were open. Reaching customer service could only be done via phone or if you waited in line to speak to the front desk. When we missed our flight home and needed to stay another night they couldn‚Äôt offer us the same price for a night that we paid with our bundle deal so we ended up booking a night at another hotel.  On the positive side the hotel itself was beautiful and the location was right in the middle of action walkable to all sorts of shops restaurants and attractions (the Bellagio fountains were a 2 minute walk). We still had a good time in Las Vegas but I‚Äôd say overall the service at Caesar‚Äôs was below average at best.
20,"Most may know but still annoying.  You get to a 5-star hotel and they want a $40+ 'resort fee'. But the pool and hot tub are closed because of Covid-19 but you still have to pay. I ask why and the amount and they reply it is for wifi. I say 'motel 6 gas free wifi""! And even so $40?? Then I get to the room. If you want coffee in the morning you need to pay $14 from for 2 cups from the snack bar or go to Starbucks. Even Motel 6 offers coffee in the room. Why can't you have room basics especially after paying a resort fee.  At checkout I see a charge for a 'snickers bar' for $14.09!!! I challenge it and they remove it. Is that standard operating procedure?? Put on changes and hope customers don't look? Crazy. The room didn't even have a snickers. They want ever penny from you before you leave so watch out!!"
50,First trip to Vegas and Caesars did not disappoint! Will be staying here next trip also! Impressed with the way they handled social distancing and promoted clean hands very often with alcohol gel every few feet. Masks were strictly enforced!
10,I‚Äôm a seven star caesars rewards player. I went to Vegas with a friend and used my seven star trip. Lines were horrible Usuallythere are separate lines for 7 star players but for some reasonthere were not They also screwed me out of $1000 in free play I had won in raffle and then tried blaming me and my hostnot to mentionlying to the higher ups of what transpired On top of this 7 star lounges were closed and in lieu of this  they gave me a whole $10 a day for food which was limited to only a few eateries. They should really learn to treat their seven star players much better or they will lose them to their competition ( MGMHard rock). I‚Äôve stayed at caesars palace before and always had good experiences. This was my first bad one and hope they learn from their mistakes or I will definitely switch casino in future .I spend a lot of money in casinos annually and expect service that I‚Äôve grown accustomed to
20,I stayed in a studio suite and upon inspecting my room due to covid i found the drawers full of the past guests clothing.. this shows me that the room was not cleaned properly.. I called the front desk and they said there was no other rooms available to switch me too.. all they can do is send house keeping up to clear out the clothing.. they cleared out the clothing but didn‚Äôt disinfect anything.. after this during the first night I woke up around 4am to the smell of Marijuana in the room.. I got thru the night and got up in the morning and the smell was still there.. after investigating where it was coming from I figured it was coming thru the vents.. I complained about that as well and couldn‚Äôt be switched rooms or offered anything.. so I went to cvs and got air freshener to get they the rest of the trip.. the smell stayed in the room most our trip..
10,"I was watching football and was told I couldn't sit at the slot bar if I wasn't playing. A white guy sat in a chair at a machine that was out of order. I stood at a machine next to him and started playing. A supervisor approached the white guy and said he couldn't sit there unless he was playing. He whined and cried and the supervisor's response was ""I'm just letting you know"" and walked away. I'm an asian female so why does the rule apply to me and not him? Do I need to whine and cry like he did?"
40,"Caesars Palace was pristine as expected when I arrived last week Tuesday night. The Foyer certainly made up for a full day of delayed flights and growing frustration. Front desk service was swift however I encountered many challenges as it relates to guest services and status benefits. The charges for internet service were unclear. It baffles me that only two mobile devices are allowed to connect to the internet and each additional device is an added fee. Considering the status of Ceasars Palace and the cost per night I am confused as to why this charge exists when I assume most people who stay at Caesars Palace travel as a group or couple and therefore have more than two devices between them. For example if i had come with my family the bill per day would be insane considering all of them would want to upload their pictures or surf the internet.  I loved my view on floor 34 however the roof is a bit off-putting. I wish that the hotel borrowed ideas from hotels I have seen abroad. If I were a designer for the hotel I would place plants in a labyrinth pattern or a Caesar head on the flat of the roof in order to market it as another ""view"". It takes away from my photos and video of the roof. I was worried that there would be some kind of dead pigeon somewhere on it hahaha but it was spottless. Additionally the bedroom was against the wall where the view was. I am certain no one comes on vacation to watch television. It would have been magical to wake up to the view of the strip or sit in the living room area and stare out at moving traffic below. Had the bed faced the wall where the television was I think that would have added to my experience. The last structural comment I will make is that while the marble floors are impeccable they worry me. I noticed many women like myself struggling to walk across the floor. Perhaps the designers in the hotel were all straight men who did not consider the way women walk in heels. I decided to change my outfit since the floors around the Fountain of the Gods was intimidating. I had an image of myself slipping or twisting my heel. My saving grace was the slither of carpets however the ramp leading down to the casino requires intense focus to walk steadily. Also he bathroom lighting was far too dim to apply makeup.  The employees including housekeeping are soo helpful. I have no idea how to use the Keurig machine and housekeeping explained it to me and the response time to any requests were lightning fast."
50,The staff in the Diamond Check in we're super helpful and want be on what they had to to make sure I got what I needed I was very grateful they made my stay there super exciting. AshleyAbbey and Ray were great and all the Diamond Check in staff made my trip truly unbelievably
20,Had called twice prior to arrival to ensure requested details were understood prior to arrival but both messages that were communicated with staff was ignored which led to confusion about location and type of room upon arrival. Didn‚Äôt get room originally requested. Ended up in a room that had a ripped headboard broken cabinets and requested a new room. New room was granted but the new room had leftover garbage from previous stay(s) in the fridge and the shower clogged up with every use. Very disappointing experience have pictures for proof but unable to attach.
10,The room was disgusting!! Mold in the Kuerig reservoir bathroom poorly cleaned and food left behind in refrigerator from previous guest. Housekeeping came in to replace Kuerig and DID NOT bother to clean the room AT ALL!! Will NEVER return!!
30,My name is Dave Rice and everything was top notch service but the valet service. The valet who checked my truck in failed to inform me that a veteran could get a platinum club card and there would not be any charges to park my truck. When l I went to get my truck to leave I had a Viet Nam Combat veteran hat on which I always wear and the valet told me my charge would be $80.00 for the two days I stayed. He never mentioned anything about the veteran policy. I know the casinos are loosing money but this is a bad way to make it. I'm sorry but Caesar's Palace has seen the last of me. If a veteran is obvious then he should be informed of casino policy.
10,NEVER AGAIN!!! Caesar's used to have good customer service not anymore! If you like being talked down to and treated like you're an inconvenience. this is the place for you. Can I give negative stars?!    In particular after receiving terrible service at the sportsbook where cashiers only cared about joking with each other and not taking bets the manager could've cared less is consistent customers (20+ years) has a good experience. After wagering at Caesar's for decades..NEVER AGAIN!!
30,Our room wasn‚Äôt completely cleaned when we arrived also the pool was closed that we didn‚Äôt know about that was why we chose Caesars just very disappointing. They also charged us for beers that were left in the fridge by other guests before us..not the best experience
20,From the moment we checked into the hotel the front desk was rude and very unpleasant towards me. Room was left undone until after 5pm. No room for food in their refrigerator and when I inquired they advise me just to take items out and return them back before I leave. Were still charged since the system is electronic for items taken out.
20,I used to stay here when I was younger best casino and best operation in town. Now it feels like a thug culture Compton Travel Lodge. This is not by coincidence. A hotel operation like Caesars takes great pains to cultivate a specific clientele. It seems Caesars has chosen to cater to a crowd that is antithetical to a weekend traveler or middle class vacationer. Consider avoiding the theme hotels in Vegas if you expect to wear anything nicer than a matching Adidas sweatsuit.
40,The room was great but there was some cosmetic things wrong. There was a bathroom cabinet that was broken. The refrigerator was locked and there was no snacks in the room.    The Carona virus kept many patrons away but above all it was a fine outing.
40,Covid visit.  2 nights during the month of November. We got a good deal through our credit card so I recommend checking your rewards or beneifts. Anyway they sent us an email for a pre check in and asked an estimated time of arrival. We are from San Diego and arrived earlier than expected. Because we pre checked in we had to go to a hotel agent instead of using the self kiosk so they can change the room number. Sanitizer stations are available throughout the property and disposable masks as well. They check your temperature before entering the kiosk part in the lobby. The agent that assisted me was Jean and I was happy with his service. We stayed at the Julius Tower on the 7th floor elevators are fast and clean. We got the double queen bed. Room sa good size not much of a view but its okay. Ac was strong and cooled the room fast. But we noticed that the room was a little bit dusty. No problem we just wiped everything but for it to be claiming to be newly renovated it was odd. Bathroom size was great. Shower was a big space and double shower head. But the bathroom door did not close it was not even on the railing and the lock did not work. A pain in the ass when we tried to leave the parking room key did not work each time so we had to call for assistance sometimes they respond fast.  It was a good stay will come back if we see another good deal
30,Was super excited to stay at Caesar‚Äôs and ended up being disappointed. When checking into our room there was a silverfish in the sink trash on the counter an industrial fan ran the whole time in the hallway outside the room to dry wet carpeting and the toilet was loose on its base and wouldn‚Äôt stop running. Decided to try to ease my annoyance in the jetted tub- it looked so inviting! I drew a hot bath and turned on the jets only to have the room quickly fill with a smelly old sock odor. Guessing the bubbles from the jets somehow carried the odor?! I dunno but that was the end of that. Was very disappointed needless to say.
30,My husband and stayed for a honeymoon and to celebrate my birthday! So we decided to take advantage of the upgrade we paid $50 to upgrade to a room that was horrible. Bally‚Äôs is a cheaper hotel and the rooms we‚Äôve stayed in there were 100% better than the room we stayed in.    Usually rooms wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal to us but this time we upgraded to a nicer room since we were celebrating our honeymoon and we‚Äôre going to be taking a more relaxing vacation staying in more than we usually would.  The carpet was ripped in several places you could see the floor underneath it the shower had nasty filth around the bottom and the knobs had filth all around it. On top of that the toilet kept bubbling which was extremely odd. Seemed to us that it was very poorly cleaned or possibly cleaned very quickly.    The overall hotel is beautiful and the few workers we had the chance to engage with were so sweet and kind but the room we stayed in was beyond horrible just disappointed because we‚Äôve seen better days. And to upgrade for $50 and pay a resort fee of over $90 I would assume that the rooms would be well kept. Just was by the far the worst stay we‚Äôve had there in Vegas
40,Perfect location in las vegas Blvd. Easy access to all activities. Free parking is available. But the parking lobby to elevator was not clean.  Hotel lobby and rooms are nice and clean. Excellent customer service.
40,This hotel is beyond beautiful! AND HUGE! and EXPENSIVE! First impressions.. BEAUTIFUL..so much to look at. Wonderful view from room overlooking Bellagio Fountains and the Strip Paris hotel..marble everywhere. Went down to the Cafe Americano (open 24 hours) to grab a bite...WOWZERS! 2 little TINY beef tacos per person 2 cokes tip..$52.00!! No extras. They have a Starbucks.. with about 6 people in line.. standing in line for 25 minutes..1 large iced tea later..$12.50. I would hate to see the line in the mornings...HELL NO! The Forum shops are beautiful with the statues and sky ceiling...name brand everything.. high name brand..Jimmy Choo Coach Michael Kors yea.. bring the credit card that is going to catch on fire just walking through. There is a steakhouse that the minimum plate is about $45.00 and that is NOT a steak.. they start at $72.00. PLUS SALAD AND ANYTHING ELSE..Went to the Cafe for breakfast.. nothing else available..Starbucks was out since the line was down the hallway and 2 people working ...we split a Carrot cake french toast with 2 pieces of ham and potatoes3 tomato slices a coffee a coke a VIRGIN bloody mary... WITH TIP..$97.00!!!!!!!!!! MY WALLET WAS HURTING AND WE WERENT THERE 12 HOURS YET! The hotel is fabulous!! The beds comfy..the views..wonderful.. STICKER SHOCK AT THE COST OF A CUP OF COFFEE.. OR COKE... PRICELESS!!
50,I‚Äôve been coming to Caesars for many years now and it has always been great- from the service to the food. This time was actually even better. It was totally noticeable. Every employee went out of their way to make sure not only I but all guests were completely satisfied with everything
30,"Shower in my room did not drain properly strip around shower door falling off one of the bath towels had odor like pizza or something the only friendly staff I met was an older African American security guard around 6am who got me a mask because I left mine in my room and was kind enough to escort me to find coffee instead of just saying "" its that way"". Kudos to him! And this room was an upgrade hate to see the others."
10,Just checked out and our folio is still incorrectly charged. Multiple charges to my cc on file that are fraudulent in nature. Asked to speak with the manager on duty and till now no callback or contact of any kind! Room was not even clean and had dust everywhere but we didn‚Äôt complain thinking it‚Äôs ok but now with all the billing issues we should have spoke up from the beginning. Everyone be aware!
20,My shower was clogged the sink was clogged. We had to call to get if fixed. When I asked for late check out they wanted to charge me. You think they would‚Äôve waived it for the inconvenience but he didn‚Äôt. He only have me one hour. Not happy at all!! This was my first time staying here. Not a pleasant experience.
10,"Don't ever stay at this ""high end property"" We were charged $50.00 for checking in early at 1:30pm. No offer to hold our 2 suitcases at the bell desk for just two hours. Valet parking is charged at 30.00 per day. Had to walk all the way across casinos and lobby's to go in and out from self parking. Parking lot and lobby's were extremely dirty. Charged 39.00 resort fee for nothing. Very strange and loud music playing throughout entire hotel. Converted to all non-smoking rooms with out telling us prior to our stay. Really this is Las Vegas with in a hotel with a thousand plus rooms. It was so bad we left 3 days early. That was the last time we will stay at any Caesars property. We will not waste an other dime at these places. Las Vegas has many places just as good in the strip area and better just a couple of miles away. People and staff were completely aloof to us. Just felt ripped off and weird. Used to be the best designed property and grand. Now crowded over built and disorganized. Don't go here."
40,This location my palace suite both times this year had problems. The shower water over flowed because it was full of hair clogged in the drain. Sink stopper was broken then at check out they will tell you that you are being charged for snacks etc missing off bar area in room when clearly you have not touched any items. Furniture missing out the rooms had to call and ask for the furniture that I knew was supposed to be there from my last visit
10,This has to be the worst service on the strip. Overpriced for what you pay for. We will not be coming back here. Charged us $525 Resort fee...what does that include? Slots don't pay either. No help for handicapped. Have to walk out back to catch Uber/Lyft.
10,this place is not worth it I was and still am very disappointed. Cleaning staff didn't empty garbage can it had someone's boxers in it. I moved furniture to look for my 15 mo. old grandsons toys and socks i not only found his toys & missing socks but there was also beer caps and other garbage under the furniture. any smaller child could've choked or injured themselves had they put it in their mouth. I saw the cleaning staff in the hall way with their cleaning/linen carts. I asked one of the ladies if I could have some towels because we had ran out the night before. Her response was 'You need to call the front desk' and she walked away.  For the money I paid to stay at Caesars Palace I had the worst customer service and the room was dirty with unclaimed Boxers.
40,"After driving 6+ hours to Vegas I could not find my ID at the self check-in express. The front end staff especially Bryan (with a Y)  on Friday November 6th at approximately 5:30pm was incredible! I was overjoyed that Bryan was so kind helpful and understanding of my unfortunate circumstance. Thank you again Bryan for calming me down and for starting my stay off in a much positive way!    Our overall stay was enjoyable but certainly not the Vegas I am used to ... Darn COVID    We were disappointed that the refrigerator was locked ""due to covid."" It seems a much safer idea to bring my own water bottles and keep them cold in a refrigerator that will be wiped down after I check out."
30,We chose Caesar's 2 celebrate my mom's 70th son's 30th & aunt's 60th 2 give them a memorable experience. The service & structure were magnificent but the room not so much! The furniture was dated & chipped along with the vanity in the bathroom. The shower drained poorly which disgusted me though it was fixed promptly. Just not really guest friendly charging $75 to simply USE their refrigerator & no microwave. I was sorely disappointed in our rooms & we reserved a block of rooms with no extra amenities.
20,I booked the octavius for two nights. When I checked in I was assigned what appeared to be a 'run of the house' room. It was the size of a regular hotel room. I called guest services and explained the size of the room. I also told her I saw a review of the room on the internet and where I was placed left a lot to be desired. Agent placed me on hold and informed me I was placed in the wrong room. Went downstairs and changed towers and room. Huge difference in the floor and the room. I didn't even get an apology for the inconvenience. I didn't get the feeling I was a valued and appreciated guest. I was celebrating my birthday. This was my first and last visit.
10,Front desk service was horrible when I return to get the room that I actually paid for. I was very understanding the first night and was told to come back the next day to get the room I paid for but then got the run around that I couldn‚Äôt get it until I asked for a Manager.
20,I was extremely disappointed with trip advisor when they quoted me a price and I paid that amount only to find out after our stay at Caesars Palace that we had an addition $51.09 per day resort fee which resulted in an additional $200.00 charge!! I'm not exactly sure what that was for since we never took advantage of any of the resort features but did supply Caesar's with money from our pockets from gambling. also why have a coffee maker in the room if you don't supply complimentary coffee. It's ridiculous that we would have to pay $20 for 4 pods of Starbucks coffee with stir sticks cream and sugar. We went to Walgreens and purchased 10 pods for $9.00. Also why have a mini fridge in the room if you can't even open it!! I realize it's Covid and we did not want the overpriced beverages or snacks but it would have been nice to have a place for any leftover food/beverages that we had. also to charge $65 if you opened the refrigerator. We will definitely be looking elsewhere next time we are in Vegas.
30,It‚Äôs beautiful but the rooms are not very special. And you get charged for everything. Coffee isn‚Äôt even included. If you touch the keurig you‚Äôll get charged. I just checked in and had to pay 85 extra to check in early. Then when I got in the room was told I can only connect two devices. Any additional device will be 14.99. Normally wifi is included in the room fee and it‚Äôs unlimited on all devices. Here it‚Äôs only two. The resort fee is so much for what you get. It covers wifi and access to the fitness center and local calls. All of those things are included for free in other hotels.
20,The nickel and dime approach this hotel has is insulting. You are mandated to pay a $50 resort fee that only includes the following: local phone calls (not needed we all have cell phones) access to the pool (which is closed most of the time) wifi access for 2 devices (free in most hotels in the world) and access to the gym (something most people don't want to use in the covid world). So what don't you get - no free water bottles and no in-room coffee/tea. Yes they have a Keurig coffee maker but its $15 to use it (for max. 2 cups). Absurd. Even on check out a $25 minibar charge had been added to our room even though we never touched anything in / around the minibar. Very suspicious given it was instantly removed when I requested it to be. Then the jetted bath tub kept turning itself on during the night and waking us up. Combined with the low ceilings in the main floors excessively loud video slots everywhere closed Starbucks convoluted parking system and massive walk from parking to front desk to hotel tower I absolutely cannot recommend this hotel to anyone.
40,COVID Stay Update (Nov 2020):  We stayed here during the week hotel is very empty Tues and Wed. The weekend crowds starts coming in Thurs afternoon and by Fri morning it was bustling.    COVID Sanitizing: Masks required at all times on casino floor and common areas. Security around to enforce it. Cleaning crew continuously wiping down gaming machines and chairs. Elevators were max 4 capacity and no issues with compliance.    Parking: Valet or self park (self park lot is close to forum shops and a long walk to check in). Suggest dropping luggage off at the front and then go self park.    Luggage: Bell man available to help with luggage.    Pet Friendly: small dogs are welcome and pet stay rooms available. The Pet relief area is near the Augustus tower side entrance.    Gaming: Both tables and gaming machines are spaced out more. Lots of space during the week but by weekend casino floor was pretty crowded. If you need a machine cleaned press the service button and someone will come. But if you can‚Äôt wait bring your own sanitizing wipes/sprays. I brought lysol and spray down the machines and seat before I play. As for tables no plexus-guards between guests or dealer. but each table seats 2-3 max. Drinks servers wear masks but drinks are served in open containers or cups definitely fewer people drinking (don‚Äôt want to take off mask).    Room: We stayed at the Augustus tower again. It‚Äôs close to the side valet entrance and not as busy as lobby entrance. Totally remodeled room and spacious. King size bed large L-shape couch desk and small dining table. Marble entry and large spacious bathroom with marble floor jacuzzi tub separate shower double sinks and toilet. We were on a pet friendly floor low floor with no views. We stayed on the 23rd floor (the first floor in this set of elevator banks) minimize time in the shared elevators.    We brought our own HEPA air purifier and kept it running in our room just in case.    Restaurants: All in casino and Forum shop restaurants were open for dine in and take out. Reduced seating capacity due to COVID.    Shops: Forum shops were all open but not crowded at all.    Shows: as of our stay shows were still closed but expected to start again later in Nov.    Enjoyed our stay felt safe and will be back again soon.    Previous Stay:    Took one star off for the slow check in and error with bill at check out. Also for older slots.    Room: there are several towers in this hotel and some are not updated. We stayed at a studio suite in the Augustus tower which was a lovely spacious room overlooking the Bellagio fountain.    Restaurants: several on site restaurants (searsuckers was excellent and Guy Savoy is amazing if you‚Äôre looking for super high end). There are also more food options at the Forum shops.    I‚Äôm a slots player and I find this hotel had more older style machines and many of the newer machines were always occupied. The air filters also could improve as it always smells a bit smoky inside.    Otherwise we had a good stay and would come back here again.
20,Cesars is okay... Comfortable large room for a good value... Resort fees when booking w/ Alegiant were not disclosed?? The Octavius Tower is a hike every time you want to go to the room... Everything on property is way over priced... Had a fun long weekend and Cesar's was an okay base camp
40,I had a good experience checking into the VIP center. I was a little surprised there was a line to check in but I guess it was the time of day. I was upgraded to a suite like usual but my room was fine. Room was clean but there is no access to room refrigerator. There is no room service. It appears to me that everyone was wearing a mask. The only surprise I experienced was the fact that the table games were $50. I opted to take the $750 play money instead of the Iphone. The $750 play money was a ripoff and I will never do that again.
40,We stayed here for three nights . 2 other couples also stayed here. We did the Augustus tower and one of the couples did nobu. I loved my room at the Augustus tower but seeing my friends suite at nobu was awesome. All in all we all liked ceasers as we felt safe. Walking in the strip in some areas esp by billagio and Paris did not feel that safe and wound up staying closer  To ceasers. My only complaint is no fridge and the one that is in the trim is stocked with their overpriced stuff and cannot be used for personal use
10,Awful place. When you get your bill back from this place they charge you $7 for breathing their oxygen. Had to call housekeeping and got charged for the call. I‚Äôve been trying to get ahold of someone to see what cost an additional $550. The gold nugget was better.
10,We arrived at caesars palace to stay in our ‚Äúclassic‚Äù room and the lady at the front desk upsold me to a ‚Äúfancy room with a nice view‚Äù only to find out that the only view was of some A/C units/utility boxes. I tried talking to guest services regarding this and they told me I had to pay extra to get moved even though they promised a room with a nice view. We then decided to just settle with what they gave us only to find out that the bed was broken and slanted down to the right. They still wouldn‚Äôt move us. On top of all that the wifi was absolutely garbage and we couldn‚Äôt even watch a single movie using it and in order to connect more than 2 devices to the wifi cost $15/device even though we spent $60/night for resort fees which covers WiFi.    This was our first time staying here and definitely our last. The Bellagio is a million times nicer/friendlier than this garbage.
40,Stayed in a King Suite in the Palace Tower at a great price during these Covid times. Room was awesome. Comfortable bed and incredible walk in shower. Very quiet. Nice views of the pool area. Caesars is a classic Vegas hotel that has aged well and maintains a good balance between classiness and overindulgence. My only gripe was the check in process. After taking the time to check in online we arrived at the hotel to find all the express check in kiosks closed and roped off forcing us to stand in a 30 min queue on a Thursday afternoon to check in. Maybe done to reduce spreading Covid but having someone standing there spraying some hand sanitizer in everyone's hand before using the kiosks would have been much better than making hundreds of people stand around in a queue together in an enclosed non ventilated space for 30 minutes especially with half the folks not wearing their mask correctly hanging below their nose.
50,Grace was a very kind person. we loved her! We appreciate all she did for my pregnant wife thank you Grace! We will not forget your kind service and the wonderful attitude you had when you were helping us
50,October 2020 stayed in the Julius tower 2 queens non smoking. Room was very clean and had standard room but bathroom was large and shower was wonderful. This tower dumps you right into the casino which we liked. Friendly staff and very clean casino. We would stay here again.
20,We stayed at the augustus strip view room. The room and bathroom were dirty with suspicious stains in the wall. The parcel center was a chaos and customer service was non existance. To book the pool you had to send a text... how old is that.
50,Safe environment where everyone masked up and the hotel maintained social distancing throughout the hotel and casino. The service staff were great and the registration desk staff was extremely helpful.
50,Me and el viejo had an amazing stay at Caesars this past weekend!    We did a two night stay and both check in and check out we're easy and simple but that might have been due to the fact that we arrived at 9 am on Friday and paid the extra $70 for early check in and also checked out before 10 am. In my opinion getting there early and paying the extra money was worth it because when we passed by the check in area after 12 pm it was PACKED even the express check in/out lines were long.    Our room was cleaned really well and was spacious. A bonus was the hot tub in the bathroom. There were snacks in the room but obviously for an extra charge...$8 for a small can of Pringles? No ma'am I'm good. Our view wasn't the best (hello air conditioner units) but it was no biggie.    My favorite thing about this hotel is how much there is to do within the actual hotel or at least within walking distance. There are so many restaurants open (2 Gordon Ramsay restaurants Cafe Americano and The Lobby bar which are both open 24 hours and Nobu) so many tables and machines for gambling and the Bellagio water fountain is right next door. El viejo also really enjoyed the Montecristo Cigar Bar. We were never bored and felt comfortable knowing that we could go right upstairs to our room for a quick break.    Regarding COVID safety I'll say it again they are doing they're best. They provide many hand sanitizer and mask stations all employees wear masks machines are spaced out and they promote social distancing and wearing masks. I did my part by taking my own bottle of hand sanitizer and cleaning wipes and doing a quick clean of the furniture in our room as soon as we walked in. But at the end of the day we're in a pandemic and going to Vegas is my choice a choice I made knowing the risks.    A little plus: get the Caesars Rewards. It's free to sign up and you're able to build points while gambling and even at most restaurants that are under the Caesar's brand.    Overall all this hotel was the perfect place to stay at for el viejo's birthday weekend and we'll definitely be back!
10,I flew from Dallas Tx to spend my birthday in Vegas at Caesars. Requested a smoking room and of course now they let you know they don‚Äôt have any. Asked to cancel my reservation and go else where and they said I would still be charged for canceling. So I stayed. Check in was smooth until I got in the room. I got to the room and alerted front desk that my room was not clean. They didn‚Äôt care especially while COVID is still strong. No one wantsto get sick if there is proper protocol. Bed had hair and blood in it  tub wasn‚Äôt clean  tiles were dirty and mini bar had not yet been restocked. They finally sent someone. She didn‚Äôt speak much Englishshe was smart and rude. I showed her the blood in the bed I had already taken pictures of she rub something on it and said no it‚Äôs not blood. No service of the rooms. The mini bar attendant never came. So when I seen a housekeeper I just exchanged towel and continued on to try to enjoy my birthday. I check out and was over charged not once but 3 times. It was 225 plus 315 plus 445. I called and asked why they said pillows were missing and sheets and other items. Other than the mini bar older alarm clock there is nothing else in the room besides a tissue holder. My charges were only suppose to be 100 dollars. Caesars palace is a rip off. I‚Äôve contacted my card company and a lawyer. 3 days later they are still charging me. Makes no since. This will definitely not be my choice of stay ever gain.
10,Weekends are just terrible overcrowding drunk rude inconsiderate people. The hotel only cares about filling rooms at any cost. This used to be an outstanding resort that has turned into nothing more than a cheap after thought I will never visit this resort again.
30,Right now there are limited restaurants shops and amenities available. Price was reasonable for the inconvenience. Casino areas was extremely smoky even though crowd was not to capacity. Air filter system made me nervous. Pulled back the covers on my bed and there were small hairs on the sheet. Made me very uncomfortable I pulled the top sheet over it and slept on top of that one...sigh...I chalked it up to Covid 19. I didnt ask for a change because I didnt want anyone else to enter the room..sigh.
50,The casino was so big that I was afraid to go anywhere on my own for fear of not finding my room again. COFFEE is $10 per cup and there's no machine provided in the room. No fridge either. Those were about the only let downs. Other than that it was beautiful  People were nice. I liked Express check in and out.
50,Great service beautiful clean room and friendly atmosphere. Machines well cleaned and spaced out seating dealers and tables also practicing covid safety. Ate at most of their restaurants! Pronto Americano Cafe Mesa Old Homestead all delicious...fun to get out of my house to eat great food and gamble in a safe environment.
50,Really enjoyed staying here the room and service was extremely enjoyable. Every restaurant was on the high side of pricing but i‚Äôm sure the quality is why. I mostly went around the strip to eat where the food was more around my price range of like 15-20 dollars a plate.
50,As magic as Las Vegas you have everything inside the hotel restaurants casino shopping OMNIA but on COVID season it‚Äôs a little sad to see very few people everywhere it‚Äôs also enjoyable because you will get the best pictures of everything without people. You need to use mask all time and in restaurants until you get your drinks.
50,We arrived very late due to traffic and the line to check in was out the door. Kevin H. was able to check us in and still be cheery and personable. it was refreshing to have someone professional and attentive in spite of how many people he has been working with all night. he gave us the feeling that we were his main priority and reassured we were taken care of.
10,Unless you are a high roller do NOT stay here. I have had better customer service at a Super 8. I am not joking or exaggerating.    We booked a king smoking. One week after booking all hotel rooms went non smoking.  No one called to tell us. It was the last place in Vegas allowing smoking rooms in all of Vegas. All because of Covid. Ok fine. But no social distancing in casinos and plenty of smoking there and at the pool. That does not seem logical to me?    Our room is dirty and has no coffee pot at all. They lied and said it was because of Covid. Three of our neighbors have them and at no charge. Every day we beg for more towels.    This all after over one hour wait at the only check in desk now. ((Due to Covid)). They claimed that the computers were ‚Äúdown‚Äù.    There is so much more but these are the little things that make a difference. When all added up we wish that we could change hotels.    They gave us $35 drink credit. That did not buy us each a drink.    I am so disappointed at all of the things but especially those not Covid related. We should have spent half of the money and stayed somewhere else.    üôè
50,Five star rating over all on our two days stay. From the day we checked in until we checked out was a very great experience. We have decided we will definitely return for another stay in the near future.
10,The room had other people‚Äôs things left in it and smears on the mirrors. Phone didn‚Äôt work. A/C was on the lowest setting and I still sweat throughout the night. Only 2 devices in a 24 hr period for WiFi in the room and then 14.99 per additional device (WHAT?). No HDMI availability on the TV and only $20 movie rentals available. After bringing up my concerns I was told ‚Äúsorry‚Äù with nothing done. Not worth going plenty of better places. But the food was great
50,Only thing to beware of is there is a daily resort fee of $51.00 that we were not aware of until arrival. It might have been in fine print on the package deal we did but wished had know or seen before arrival. Then had to also have an extra$200 hold for assundries until check out. The $200 was taken off our bill at checkout.sorry too no shows but still good to be away from home.
40,Reserved room for 10/24-10/29 stay through app. Easy to navigate. Requested upgraded room. 10/24 checkin kiosk worked smoothly. Our room was ok (rm717). View was mostly of next door rooftop(disappointing). Issues in room from faulty lights above vanity crack on closet door and door for HVAC system was open. 10/26 I registered for tier rewards ‚Äúdiamond‚Äù level. 10/28 met KRISTIN at same register desk to unfortunately check out a day earlier due to family emergency. KRISTIN was very very helpful and noticed the room was not upgraded but we were still getting charged. KRISTIN reassured us that she would look into this and resolve the mistake. I hope that KRISTIN will be recognized by upper management in her professional demeanor. KRISTIN in the diamond registration desk exemplified great customer service!!! Also GILLIAN at the front door was very welcoming and understanding. Thank you thank you to KRISTIN and GILLIAN
30,"This is our first stay at Caesar's palace. I'm not sure if the service is usually this bad. But please avoid staying here atleast during the Covid period. During check in they asked us if we wanted daily room cleaning. We said yes. First day we are away all day and return to find that our room was not serviced. Okay maybe it was a miscommunication. So we call and get our room added to the cleaning list and just request fresh towels. It took them a full 60 minutes to bring us the towels. Fine maybe they are understaffed. But the next same thing repeats all over again. Housekeeping skipped our room again. So we call them and this lady answers very rudely and says ""oh you should have informed us what time you were leaving"". Inspite of calling them 2 times to confirm that our room is added to the cleaning list we get these random excuses and frankly rude responses from the staff.  Please do yourself a favor and book elsewhere."
30,Booked a suite for our 28th wedding anniversary. Upon arrival discovered no robes no slippers  no tea as advertised on the website. started unpacking and discovered trash in the drawers... called front desk and they stated no longer available for suites. I said to fix you web site. Offered a room cleaning but declined as we cleaned it . Wife said to forget all the issues and just to enjoy our anniversary. Looking forward for ceasars to open the buffets and return the amenities that I was expecting and paid for. I will still return.
10,No room cleaning even when you request it. The room was filthy when we checked in with dust everywhere and some kind of dried red liquid on the countertop in the bathroom. Asked for a manager to call about the condition of the room and was told it would be 48-72 hours later that I would get a call back. 48 hours was 15 hours after we left yesterday so what is the point of calling back after people have already left? The Ivy app / messenger is also useless never had an answer for any of our issues and just attitude from staff. We won't be going back especially with the $50 'resort fee' charge for internet. Going back to MGM where they at least do customer service right.
40,Went for my anniversary and it was a nice stay the room was very cozy. All requests such as extra towels housekeeping and help opening our safe were answered almost immediately. I would say overall a pleasant experience!
50,Very clean spacious rooms. The marble bath and large tub with separate shower is a plus. The rooms are well put together and maintained. We liked the virtual concierge via texts. We got lost many times but it was fun to figure out the property.
20,The receptionist during check-in was very rude. I asked her a few questions and she ignored be both times. The room was very dirty. There were white droppings around the toilet. The floor in the bathroom was dirty never mopped. Behind the toilet was dirty. The shower and one of the sinks was clogged up. They fixed it the next day though. They have a very few waiters on the floor while on the floor playing slot machines. When I did get one they were very rude. I basically spent most of my time at the Cosmopolitan. They had great service and everyone was very nice and professional. I will stay there next time. Me and 12 family members are going back in a few months and I will not recommend this place to any family member or friend.
20,"Forget what Caesar's used to be like. Now you get rowdy parties in the rooms (I had to call security 3 times!) machines are tight food is limited and higher priced now forget using the pool - they've shut down some of the pools and limited the number of people to where you can't even go in and they've taken the best spots for sun exposure and turned them into paying beds if you want to use them. On top of the $50 per day in resort fees!! I had to call every day to ensure we had our room cleaned even after requesting that it be set up as an automatic recurring request! Forget the front desk helping now they have ""Liv"" a computerized program that will text you instead.  Skip Las Vegas no shows no service and it's a rip off!"
40,Luxury and Beauty! As I reflect on the experience I realize I wasn't sufficiently analytical upon my arrival. I wondered around looking for various locations. Later I discovered there was a map that would have helped. Everyone I queried however was ready to be of assistance. I flew into LasVegas on Thursday and was prepared to perform.on Friday - a day devoted to being oriented by the staff. By Saturday the edge of my excitement had worn off and on Sunday I was no longer at my peak I had one enormous problem that continued with me. My bank where I have done business for years was resistant to covering room costs. The confrontation at registration although eventually resolved left me feeling like a Mac Truck had run over me. I did my best on Sunday but was very unsatisfactory with my performance of which nothing could be blamed on Pitchfest or Authors Solutions. It was a joy to have the experience and I shall always be appreciative.
10,We booked Caesars Palace from Oct 19-22. We had been royal to Caesars for 10 Years. We got comp room most of time. We had rent a scooter for my dad during these stays. We always park it outside of our room for fast 10 years. During this trip HIs scooter got stolen at 36th floor at Augusta tower at 4 am ( told by security after they checked the footage of camera) They told us that they drove off toward Bellagio. During this trip I had notice that the security at this property is not safe at all. you dont see them present at the entrance only at the front of check in area to check guess's temperture.  We find out there is tier match up program at MLIFE ( MGM property). We went over to Bellagio to match up our tier program. We will not stay at Caesars next time. We will lookng forward to the MGM property.
40,Great place to stay. Rooms are nice large and imo have very comfortable mattress/bedding. Location is central to many other popular casinos restaurants shopping. Beware of the over priced resort fees!!! Not sure we are getting what we are paying the extra for. The Parking structure is confusing so visitor beware. Also the parking structure elevators are very congested during peak times...obviously especially with Covid precautions. Recommend Caesars to provide attendants to allow for smooth and efficient transport.
40,If you have a car this is a good place to choose and there is free self park. Room - including the bathroom - was really nice. Spotless. We were only here to shower sleep and move o so cannot comment on all the facilities except to say there is a lot of stuff to do gamble eat shop
50,Love  Love  Love this hotel and the staff . I hated the room they gave us at check in  But Tomek was super great and on top of things and found us a better room ASAP ! The treatment from the staff was outstanding! Everyone was helpful and kind . I will definitely be staying again ! Thank you for the 5 start service !!
40,I stayed in the Octavious Tower which is very nice and near the pool and Starbucks. The pool doors closest to the tower are closed so you will have to walk around and enter by the Palace Tower. The only small blip us that the Starbucks service is very slow they have 4 to 5 people working and it still takes a long time to get a cup of coffee my Starbucks in Washington has two ladies and can knock it out a lot faster then the 4 or 5 the Caesars Starbucks can. The buffet Rao's and Mr. Chows are still closed and the Mesa Grill will be closing for good in November. You must wear a mask inside the hotel and the pool area even if you have a cabana. You must also wear a mask if you're sitting next to the pool with your feet in the water you can only take it off if you're in the pool.
20,Our stay started horribly. The room we are given is so noisy with a loud vibration. We called guest services a total of 3 times for someone to come and check the noise . We waited for 1 hour but nobody came. We called again and was told we can change room and just go down to reception desk on the right side for room change. Ones we hot down there was no such window and was told we have to line up again like we are checking in. The line was long and slow moving. The security checking the temperature told us to approach the supervisor standing there and ask if he can help us. I approached the supervisor but he was a total jerk. He yelled at me and told me to line up again because there is nothing he will do for us. It took another 30 to 40 minutes to reach a reception clerk to change the room. In all we wasted 2 1/2 hours if our day just to get a room. The rooms are large but very old. Head boards have damage and leather is fading. Compared to other hotels Bellagio. Palazzo and Encore are much better. Even Mirage or TI have better service. Lesson learned. I will stick to hotels I received courteous and friendly service.
10,First time going to Vegas and was really disappointed with Caesars. From the very beginning waiting 45 minutes in line to check in. Or waiting 45 minutes to get a coffee from Starbucks. The worst part about it was for the most part my staff interactions were pretty bad. I felt like they were doing me a favor by providing any sort of help condescending and rude when it came to any sort of question or participating in normal resort activities. I will be telling friends to look elsewhere for a stay in Vegas.
50,My husband and I just returned from Caesar‚Äôs Palace Las Vegas. I wanted to give a few shout outs to some people who made this trip incredibly stress free and fun!  First my Caesar‚Äôs host Jesse L. thank you for booking our amazing king room fountain view in the Augustus Tower! You never let me down!  Check in at Diamond Registration: special thanks to Hugo and Cameron! We were in our room in less than 10 minutes and arranged that our friends could be in the same floor as us!  Check out: big thank you to Ray for explaining our bill and printing it out!  Hard working people that I mentioned are the reason Caesar‚Äôs Palace Las Vegas is our go to place when we visit!
10,Shower was clogged. Flooded the whole bathroom with 2 inches of water getting clothes wet that were in a suitcase on the floor. After 2 calls they came up. They unclogged the drain and the shower floor covered in whatever they cleaned out of the drain including grease hair and glass shards. The coffee maker did not work. I was also forced out because the friend that was with me turned in his room key before he left so they shut off the internet and told me I had to leave even though it was my credit card held for the room. No bueno
50,Five stars to Julia P. who provided check-in service for us. She really listened to my requests for room type view etc. and accommodated all our needs. Our room is large and luxurious. Our experience at Caesar‚Äôs has certainly met our expectations.
50,I loved my large comfortable Augustus tower room with whirlpool tub and view of the fountains and strip and the great service given to diamond members. I‚Äôve no complaints except for wishing the other guests could be 100% mask compliant.
40,Despite the Covid-19 challenges Caesar is doing their best to keep place clean and safe. Staff are very attentive and I am glad we picked here for our trip.  What we did not enjoy was the zoo like atmosphere at the 4 pm check-in time.  Tried using their text ‚ÄúIvy‚Äù was ok but I think response time should be a bit faster.
30,"We booked this hotel thinking it would be amazing since you pay a pretty penny for the rooms! I booked 2 double beds NON SMOKING in the Augustus tower. We arrived early so we asked if we could check in they said no that the room wasn't ready which was fine they said that they would text/email me as soon as the room was go to go. Well that never happened. We checked in at 3:50 & I got a text at 3:52 that the room was ready ‚Äç we got in the room & we had asked for non smoking I opened the toilet door and omg it was penetrating in there. We noticed they covered the fire detector with a plastic bag I‚Äôm assuming the previous ppl so it wouldn‚Äôt detect the smoking. The room was run down. Stains on the carpet. At this point I didn't even go back to tell them I was so tired my kids were tired. You'd think they would smell it & put some kind of odor remover. So we did vallet so if would be easier to bring the luggage down. Well they came me the card & when I tried to call with our room phone the phone was unplugged then I tried to call & never got a hold of anyone. I received a text from ""Ivy"" basically saying just to text back & they would assist us in anything we needed so I did text about the bell desk gave our info & they responded that it would be here shortly well 2 hours later and it still wasn't here. Had to call again and they directed me numerous times til I finally got a hold of someone 2 hours later my stuff finally arrived. Not impressed with this hotel I was expecting way more. Gave it a 3 star because it had a nice view! Room was not the greatest and very disappointed with the smell I couldn‚Äôt even be in there for more than 5 minutes."
30,The resort fee was absurd! As far as I could tell we paid $51.00 per night for the internet which we didn‚Äôt use and access to the (really nice) pool. Due to COVID limitations we only got into the pool area one day. We did feel safe though with masks and temp checks throughout.  Get the Caesar‚Äôs Rewards card - save money on the room rates.
20,The sink in the bathroom would not drain and black sludge particles started to float in the water. I called guest services but had to leave a message and no one came  to fix the sink. I had to bail the water out with the glass and garbage can and dump it down the shower.
30,Gave this place a chance but never again will my family & I be staying there again. The rooms are so small & run down! The headboard of the beds looked like a cat had clawed them & the bathroom was so dirty! Never again! Back to the Venetian Hotel it is for us.
10,The check in was terrible and it was through VIP... I made the reservations 3 weeks before are trip and they didn‚Äôt have 2 of my rooms even though I called and confirmed reservation.... they were rude to me and told me if I had any other problems go somewhere else... we just wanted the rooms we booked... even after showing the emails and proof of reservation the manager in VIP is terrible and rude....we booked the Caesar‚Äôs forum tower suite with 2 add ons...and two other rooms for our friends...they argued with me for 3 hours upon arrival til I just gave up and my friends had to get rooms in other hotels... so after all that drama we went to our room and it was so dated nothing worked (tubs remote curtains) stains on carpet and floors... cigarette burns on tables and chairs... and we paid over $5000 for three nights... absolutely no customer service no robes no coffee maker. And forget about 6 feet people are flooded in Caesars palace...
10,I was misled by the Valet Attendant. He stated if you are a Caesars Reward Card holder Valet is Complimentary. Only to find out I was charged $30.00 a day because I was not a High Roller Card holder.. I was also charged $9.75 ea. for 2 beers I did not drink but moved it in the small refrigerator to place my diet coke in the refrigerator. I called billing dept. to dispute the charges but the rude lady put me on hold and no one ever picked up my call. I will never stay at Caesars again.
10,Why would there ever be a 45 minute line for check in its not like they don't know how many rooms they sold for that given day.2:00 pm checking request turned into 6pm. Terrible service at the bars. The room price was good but that was more than made up by the drink and food price.
50,We went to relax and both my wife and i did exactly that . Bed was very comfortable and room was so very clean . We were a little concerned with covid and all but to our delight the resort was very clean everywhere . We are planning to go back soon . We found all the staff to be very friendly and helpful . 10-13-2020. JUST WISH THE BUFFET IN THE HOTELS WERE OPEN ............ OH YEA THIS PLACE IS IN MY OPINION THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF ALL ON THE STRIP
30,The room had wear and tear no daily housekeeping had to wear a mask EVERYWHERE closed shops early table game minimum seemed higher WiFi limited to 2 devices resort fee in addition to Somewhat pricey room for what it was. Starbucks in resort was more expensive. Gym was decent but again mask mandate. This was billed as a renovated hotel but was anything but I. The room we had. MJ smell throughout. Good location on the stop for walking to and from.
20,Never going back. I miss the old ceasar palace customer service. Unfortunately the front desk staff including the early morning manager needs customer service inservice or training as this important to competent with other high-end hotels in Las Vegas. A lot hidden cost including internet service trap. The hotel needs up their game to be the best in Vegas
50,Booked our hotel through Allegiant and it was perfect. When we checked in through the Kiosk it was simple and quicker than standing in line for a live person. We were automatically upgraded to a nicer room for no additional charge.    The hotel is overwhelming when you first get there if you are not used to bigger cities but we quickly learned our way around. Our room was clean and roomy with a view of the Bellagio fountains. We are already planning on another trip there.
50,We stayed at Ceasars Palace October 15th-18th. I had read many negative reviews lately so I was optimistically skeptical of what was in store for us. We booked 2 ajoining rooms one king and double beds 3 of us in the Julius Tower. The only negative to the whole trip was checking in wait. I would think this day and age they would have this down to where folks don't have to wait in line like an amusement park popular ride but again this was my only negative. We people working at Ceasars all seemed to want your business. Our romms were perfect and I'd recommend this tower not for the views we had but the peacefulness at night if was very quiet and the elevator bank is in the middle of the casino. The bell hop crew and valet guys were on point the whole trip. The dealers we dealt with were all nice and laughed and me and my buddies fun banter at the tables. We had a great time on. Also golfed at Pauite Golf course and it was also amazing. The covid issues are taken seriously and you will be asked to where a mask but you'd seriously be one in 100 not wearing a mask everyone is wearing them so if you're a no masker don't go you won't have a good time. I was concerned about that but it was only slightly annoying. At the blackjack tables we just pulled down our mask to drink a beer then carry on with it on. The cocktail waitresses were on point all weekend at every casino we played at Ceasars linq and flamingo. Very happy with our trip.
20,Definitely not what I expected in a bad way. The room was dated and filthy. Food stains on the window and rug clipped fingernails on the carpet the previous guest‚Äôs hair in the bathtub just to name a few things. The shower did not work at all. No access to the refrigerator in room without paying a $75 fee?!? WIFI for only 2 devices? Also the resort is not really taking adequate COVID-19 precautions aside from the mask requirement. Overall not happy with this place and would not visit here again.
50,From check in to check out I had the most amazing time at Caesar‚Äôs palace. I came to celebrate my Anniversary and I was treated like a queen. Jean at the front desk was so sweet hospitable and accommodating. He made check in a breeze. Once you get to your room you have your own text message assistant who can answer all your questions. The room was a palace with the best view of the Bellagio Fountains.  Hail Caesar!!! I will stay here again and again!!
50,Had a wonderful stay here! The Palace room was great. ln my opinion Caesars is the best centrally located hotel. You can cross the streets with ease to be anywhere along the strip. I recognized the employees were working hard to maintain the highest standards of sterility. The room gym elevators restaurants and casino felt fresh and clean. Can't wait to book my next stay here again soon!
20,"ARRIVAL:    We booked a 2 night stay in the Palace Tower with reservations for a King Premium. If you have never been to Caesar's Palace before I suggest downloading a map because it's difficult to find your way around especially if you are checking in for the first time and carrying all your bags.    CHECK IN:    They have a clean process between guests checking in. But my personal experience was a little frustrating. The woman who was getting my information made a phone call and told me that they don't have any rooms available for a King Premium that I had originally reserved but they have a room with 2 Queen Beds available. I told her that was not okay I specifically requested a King Premium and she went on to say ""well this is the only thing available it's actually more expensive to book a 2 Queen Bed Room."" OOOOOH girl. I didn't make a big deal out of it because the last thing I wanted was to be in a bad mood the first hour of my vacation. But this was so unprofessional. If I WANTED 2 beds in my room then I WOULD HAVE reserved that. She went on to say that the Palace Tower is the nicest Tower and that changing the reservation to accomodate for a King bed would mean we would be staying in a less appealing area. After going back and fourth with her for a few minutes she decided to add ""I can offer you a $50 food and drink credit to be used in the resort."" In the end it didn't matter anyways because I checked my receipt and I was charged about $50 worth of mini bar snacks and some other hotel charge. The total amount exceeded what I originally was supposed to pay.    ROOM:    The room was mediocre and clean for the most part however there was no trash bags in the trashcans so I hope they are disinfecting the whole trash can between guests as this can present as a health issue. I gave 2 stars because the only thing we liked about our stay was the bathroom and the giant spa tub. Also during a check in they ask if you'd like houseskeeping which we refused but it didn't matter because they still came anyways. Oh and 2-3 of the lights in the room were flickering and/or not working.    CASINO & RESORT:    During the COVID Era I'm sure it wasn't as packed as it normally is but it was definitely busy. Machines require a space between you and the next person in your party but as long as you don't mind sitting and touching the machine after someone has used it then you should be okay. It's difficult to find a place to eat unless you reserve a time for one of the celebrity chef's restuarants. It's definitely not a good time to ""wing it."" Plan your dining ahead of time so you don't spend an hour or two trying to find a breakfast spot or a restaurant that isn't already booked.    To sum it up we will not be staying at Caeser's Palace again. To be over charged without an explanation and have your entire stay changed because the room we originally reserved was not available is a poor experience."
30,They weren't willing to do any upgrades without paying an extra 65.00 per day. They certainly weren't at capacity during Covid and should have tried to give the guests the best experience they could if they want them to return. My room had garbage and old rotten food under the desk from previous guests as well as used Q-tips and hair on the bathroom floor. The carpet was disgusting. All this definitely made me question how clean everything in the room was. Not good during a pandemic (or anytime for that matter) If you like a firmer mattress you will not like the beds. They are like sleeping in a bag of cotton balls. Rooms are in the smaller side compared to other properties.
10,"Wow! Where to begin? Like everyone was tired of being locked up due to Covid so we decided to book a 5 day/4 night trip  to Vegas just to get away for a bit. Fell for the bait and switch that's going on in Vegas right now. Booked several  weeks in advance only to get notifications 48 hours before our flight that the shows had been cancelled. Upon  arriving we came to learn there are very few entertainment choices available. Turns out it's just a way to get people to  come and spend their money at the casinos.    The icing on the cake however was Ceasar's Palace. Upon arriving at the hotel the check-in was an immediate opportunity  for them to upsell us into a more expensive suite. Keep in mind the original booking wasn't budget by any means. We booked  a one bedroom king bed suite. After politely declining the upgrade we were given our keys and given directions to the suite.  Apparently Ceasars doesn't offer any type of assistance or help with luggage.    When we opened the door to the suite we were shocked. The room definitely was not what was represented to us when we booked  online. The furnishings are dated and shabby to be generous. But the part that made us go back down to the lobby to request  another room was the fact that there was little to no natural light. The living room consisted of windows that if they opened  you could reach out and touch the concrete wall they faced about two feet away. This shaft led to natural light approximately 15-20  feet away. Worse yet was the master bedroom whose windows had been taken out and replaced with mirrors. The room had  a distinct feeling of an oversized supply closet.    Upon requesting another room with some sort of natural light we were told we would be charged and additional $140. As my  wife was on the verge of tears no biggie figured that would be the end of the nightmare. But noooo for our stay at Ceeasar's  the fun was just beginning. While the new room we were given did have nice views of the strip (with natural light finally)  we certainly could have done without the other amennites or lack thereof Ceasar's decided to include. Amenities such as what  could best be described as ""bodily fluids"" on the couch in the living room chaise lounge in the bedroom and hand towels in the bathroom (see  attached photos). Or maybe it was during our stay not once (yes you read that correctly) were we provided with housekeeping  service. No fresh towels no cleaning of the room no emptying of trash cans. Apparently our ""neighbors"" weren't receiving  housekeeping either as they began piling their trash in the hallway outside their door which gave off a beautiful aroma of rotting  food. If this is Ceasar's idea of ""Covid clean"" I can only imagine how disgusting this place is during normal times.    Let me finish by saying I could go on for many more pages but hopefully everyone gets the picture. It takes a lot for me to write  a review (good or bad) but in all my travels I can honestly say this had to be my worst hotel experience. If you  a looking for a side of the highway fleabag motel Ceasar's could potentially break the top 5 places to stay in Vegas.  With so many choices Ceasar's won't even break my top 50 the next time we go."
10,My family and I booked 2 rooms at Caesars from Oct 9-12 2020 and our stay was not memorable. It was terrible forgettable and the most awful stay. The trouble started when Caesars front desk had the wrong check in date. They fixed it right away because the email confirmation I showed them was correct. Their system had a different date but the dates were fixed.    We had 2 rooms in Octavius Tower and all the rooms that were given to us were dirty. The rooms were not cleaned for weeks maybe because of short staffing during COVID. I was first given room 5175 and I requested to be moved because it was filthy. I was moved to 6165 next but it was the same dirty room. I can guarantee you that the housekeeping supervisor has not seen any of the rooms probably since reopening. I had no choice but to stay in room 6165 because it was already late when my family arrived on Oct 9. Our second room was room 6151 it was dirty as well. I called housekeeping and the maid changed the bedsheets and pillowcases as it was all stained. It was disgusting! See photos I have taken of the 2 rooms. I complaint the next day and the Front Desk Manager comp one night of stay for 1 room only. That‚Äôs the best that Caesars can do.    The staff at Caesars from front desk to the bell man to wait staff and housekeeping are ALL RUDE! Every time I asked for help the Caesars staff were rude and I felt like I was bothering them. It‚Äôs their job to make the guests feel welcome and comfortable and my family and I did not receive the warm reception. I understand it‚Äôs the pandemic so if the staff does not want to work they should quit their job. The worst person I‚Äôve dealt with was the waitress at the Nobu restaurant. We ate there on Oct 11 for an early dinner and this girl who served us hated her job. Or maybe she did not like serving us because we did not order any drinks.    Overall take your money elsewhere. Don‚Äôt stay at Caesars. The rooms are dated and dirty and the staff are rude. The restaurants are overpriced and the food was not worth the price. Hope this review helps.
10,I reserved a Non-smoking King size bedroom in the Julius Deluxe Tower on the Cesar Palace website 2 months before our trip. When My husband and I checked in for our room at 12pm. We thought that we were on time for check in because when we reserved our room on the website it had asked us when we would like to check in. We added that we would be at the hotel by 12pm for check in. However when we arrived to check in we were told that check in was not until 4pm and that we would have to pay a fee for an early check in! We were then told that there were NO rooms available in the Julius Tower UNLESS we did an upgrade for an additional $55 per night. We decided to do the upgrade and as the front desk staff proceeded to make the change for us she made a phone call and then hung up and informed us that there were NO MORE rooms for upgrade. We were so confused! She should have confirmed with other staff to see if rooms were even available for upgrade before asking us if we wanted to upgrade and then turning us down after we agreed to the upgrade. we were then told to wait until 4pm for a text our call stating that our room is available. We waited 5 hours for a text or call and never received one! I went to the front desk and explained to them our situation. The finally got us a room but it was a room in the Forum tower! WE didn't even get the room that we had reserved and paid for 2 months in advance! I had asked the front desk if the room we were places in had a different price from the Julius Deluxe Tower room that we had paid for and she said that there was no price difference. I was frustrated and did not want to press on the matter further. I reluctantly agreed to the room. When we arrived to our room we found that the shower handle was broken! It was difficult to turn the shower handle for warm water. Later that night I went online to see if the price for the Julius Deluxe Room was different from the room we received in the Forum tower and lord behold there was a $100 per night difference! The Julius Deluxe room that I had paid for in advance was $100 more per night than the room that the staff gave us! I spoke to the front desk about it and they informed me that they couldn't move me or give me an upgrade. This is the first and last time I will be spending my time at Cesar's Palace when I am in Vegas. The staff are horrible the hotel provided false advertisement and the room that we received was in poor condition!!!
20,bathrooms were dirty people in next room had 3 dogs who barked consistently - called desk for help and got none. Told us there were no other rooms available. When checked out an additional $40 added to bill for alcoholic beverages. My husband and I do not drink. Bad experience all around.
20,Got scouted by an associate asking me to give them a try. They will not get anymore of my business. Diamond does not mean what it used to. Absolutely no concern for your concerns. Stay ANY place but here.
50,Thank you Julia P for your professionalism and friendliness as you assigned my room and provided guidance during my recent stay at Caesars Palace (week of October 6th) . I got the impression that professional service is your game plan and it showed. I love Caesars Palace and look forward to returning again soon.
30,The first day that we were there we had a sign of do not disturb by our door when we came back the house keeping they apparently went to our room took the sign out without our permission or us being in the room when we came back we complained to the house keeping they said they sorry but after we left they charged us $250 for deep cleaning the room I have no idea why they did that I was there with my 21 year old daughter we absolutely left the room so clean we have been staying at Caesars so many times but no more this was a horrible experience for us.
10,Not a heavy traveler here in the first place but stayed here one night. Hotel was ok but the crowd inside and out made me uneasy.  Then to top off the night there‚Äôs a shoot across the street while me and my family are watching the fountain at the Bellagio at 730pm.  Just too many safety concerns for me.
50,I've stayed at Caesars Palace before and have always had a great time but I recently just stayed for the first time after obtaining Diamond status. Hugo checked me at the VIP desk and took great care of me as I had booked multiple rooms for my wedding. I had a great stay as usual and the pools at Caesars were a huge hit as always. When it came to check out Jay at the VIP desk was amazing and also took great care of me. At the bell desk Anthony also went above and beyond to take great care of me with Daryl at the valet as well. While the property itself is great it is the people such as Hugo Jay Anthony Daryl etc that really make it exceptional.
10,Don't spend your money here. Its not very customer friendly and its really bad. Waited four hours on a pool list. Never got to go. Asked for a room with a view months before and got view of just pipes and junk. No coffee in room. Bathroom was dirty. Lots of other things wrong. Not worth the money.
30,Cannot activate my rewards card..called twice and they said to reset pw..but it won't email it to me...I won on slots and want to make sure I get the rewards for it...help!!  Blingbling117@wowway.com. ty
30,Our room was in the Forum tower. The furniture was old and the bathroom was missing an electronic panel. The hotel is big so be prepared to do a lot of walking. Other hotels that I stayed at on my trip made sure to inform customers of what they are doing regarding COVID19. One had tape on the door informing us that the room had been sanitized another left a note mask and hand sanitizer in a welcome bag. We did not receive any information from Caears about enhanced cleaning.
40,Thanks to MEHRET for upgrading my room as a Caesars Diamond!    If you're not afraid of COVID Caesars is a nice place to stay!    Wish the pool would open later at night apparently it closes early. Perhaps on another trip.
20,We haven't stayed here in years and I was excited to be back. However it was so disappointing. The quality of Caesars is gone. The room was shotty. The drapes were broken furniture was old and scuffed walls were scratched and dirty pictures were were falling apart. My keys stopped twice. The water was more like milk then water. It's just not what you expect when paying so much
50,Nice king room in Octavius Tower at end of hall facing pool. Needed engineering to change filter then terrific. Very comfortable for 2 nights. Diamond staff very well trained. Could not get into pool. Need early reservations. Many restaurants closed at present.
10,The room was not cleaned when we checked in. The shower wasn't working. Even the trash was not cleared. We came in as a couple celebrating our 6 months of marriage and this is the experience we get!!!
50,Eric is one who help me check-in he is thoughtful resourceful and very friendly!  He let me know where how and enjoy at Ceasars Palace LV.  Also Chris at Starbucks provides Great services to speed up the long line waiting high five!!
50,Macy was very polite spirited and effective. She listened carefully to my requests worked diligently to assist and provided great advice on room views. She was excellent in providing helpful info for future stays as well. She genuinely cared and sacrificially helped to make my stay wonderful!
10,The service we received on this visit was terrible. Apparently the staff doesn't care what's happening in their hotel. We had to call security 4 times because the rooms on both sides of our room were smoking pot running up & down the hallway hollering at one another slamming doors & we got only one hour of sleep. After speaking to management they were so generous (NOT) to offer us $50 at one of their over priced restaurants. The restaurant prices were twice as much as other nice restaurants. They were much more concerned with the placement of our face masks than they were for our safety??? We've been long time patrons staying at Caesar's year after year but we will not be staying there again. After speaking with some of the staff there they agreed things have gone wayyyy down hill...
10,This was our first trip to Vegas to celebrate a bachelor party. I‚Äôve been to other places in Atlantic City and Pennsylvania and this trip to Vegas was terrible. For the amount of money spent to go here we did not get the attention we deserved. I was pressured to upgrade my room to a suite which didn‚Äôt have enough towels bedsheets ashtrays (a smoking room should have them already). I wasn‚Äôt asked for my rewards card at check in at the tables or anywhere else. The dealers at the craps tables were rude to our party and all the food places were closed they even suggested we go across the street to flamingo to get food. You think in Las Vegas in one of the top resorts there would be at least one place to get food. I know Covid has an effect but now they‚Äôre taking too much advantage of the situation. There should be one way for guests to get food at all times when they‚Äôre spending thousands of dollars at their resort. Oh and the best part I was told there would be a refundable $500 deposit upon check out and my card was charged $1730.95 when the room total was $550.46. If the correct amount is not adjusted by tomorrow I will be calling the fraud dept at my bank.
10,Booked a two queen Julius Executive Suite with a connecting King attachment. The first room I was given had not been cleaned. i have video of the food smashed into the walls that had crusted and dried to the ceiling and crown molding. It was absolutely disgusting. The floors were dismal at best and there were other markings on the walls. I have video of it as well as the head of housekeeping she also took pictures herself. I was moved from those rooms and told I would get a call when a new room was ready. NO ONE EVER CALLED. I had to wait YET AGAIN in a massive line and when I inquired about my room I was brushed off and told it wasn't ready (AFTER WAITING 5 hours and being after 4 p.m. which was regular check in (after paying for early)) I was so disappointed. This was my first getaway without my kids and to deal with such poor customer service and horrible rooms I was beyond irritated. On top of it the rooms cost well over $2000 for the weekend. I will NOT stay here again and recommend others to do their research. I had to complain multiple times about the food on the walls and it wasn't until a staff member came in to review the room that they agreed to change me to a different room. Unbelievable and unacceptable.
40,Our room was beautiful. Stayed in the Octavius tower this time. Jets in tub didn't work and then the lock on the door had to be serviced batteries died. For our inconvenience only offered $25 credit to the used at Starbucks. Not that big a fan of Starbucks so it was never used. Wish we had a credit for food at one of their restaurants or drinks from one of the bars instead. Some free play would have also been a nice thing to offer. Overall our stay was a very good one. We will stay again.
40,Stayed at Caesars in the Octavius Tower first weekend in October. Room is very nice however showing some signs of wear. The headboard had peeling scratches and the drawers and nightstand could use a touchup. But overall a pleasant stay. The rules on the mask wearing is a bit much I'm sitting at a machine with a Bloody Mary in hand and got yelled at for having my mask down. Machines are defiantly tightened down not many payouts.
50,What a great check in experience we had on our Honeymoon by the team member Elpidio. We had scheduled our trip to Vegas and booked a room 3 days in advance but decided to go 2 days earlier. At the check in desk we had Elpidio helped us with a room for that day and he was so helpful and got us a very nice room with the best view. We had so much fun and was so happy with our stay that we stayed longer than we had planed.  The hotel room was clean and neat. The view was amazing! The cleaning staff had our room cleaned even when we had forgotten to request it for one. The house keeping staff was friendly and helpful. We had Good food everywhere we went.  Mike and Karla Peters
30,773335667    The hotel was lovely but during our stay 6 months into virus- being forced and hounded continually to wear a mask when u r 6 ft from the person in their lounge chair is a bit ridiculous- Hotels and so may business can not survive with these regulations. My advice is Don‚Äôt go until u can sit by the pool mask free -otherwise u will have a nice tan mark on your face...üôÑ
10,I would not visit Caesars during Covid. I just spent four days there and it was a terrible experience.  - the food was average at best ( even at Nobu)  - the room was avg( the mattress was terrible). Not what I‚Äôm use to.  - the gaming was ‚Äúno bueno‚Äù. Not a one payout after 4 k in spending. I did not see anyone else win either.  - I‚Äôm a High level VIP in Caesar Rewards program. Normally they comp my food spending ... this time nothing ( after 4K in gaming spend).when I went to VIP host office to do what I normally do go over portfolio and get things comp‚Äôd. This women was rude and did not even thank me for visiting and spending money. Oh yeah - no comps at all.  I will not return to Caesars - my business is going to MGM properties. They did not appreciate my business.
50,We arrived late and was exhausted but Elpidio swept us off our feet with his superior customer service. We wanted a specific tower and he took his time to find a smoke free room. We were also stuck on if we wanted 2 queen size beds or 1 king size bed but Elpidio didn't rush us. He was extremely patient and allowed us time to decide. In addition he took the time to explain the differences between the different hotel towers! He definitely made our stay worthwhile. Thank you Elpidio if you read this!
50,Wonderful hotel in a great location and the guys at the front desk evanper were professional and very nice I will definitely come back.  It was a good stay I really enjoyed my room view and clean.  I will back again and recommend you.
20,We visit Vegas often. This was our 4th trip this year. We normally stay at the flamingo and other more economical properties under the Caesars umbrella where the quality and and cleanliness of the overall rooms are much better.    We had a smoking double queen room and it seem all the smoking rooms were wore out. None had garbage bags or ashtrays and I also noticed there was no sticker verifying the room had been cleaned. All of which I was going to over look until I turn or the sink in the bathroom and the sink drained extremely slow. I wanted to change rooms at this point. The smoking rooms are more I didn't book through a third party so why is the room so wore out.  The next room again had no sticker showing COVID cleaning. No trash bags no ashtray. The wood on the entertainment center was wore out and dusty. There was a bubble of the light in the shower as if water was going to pour our head. Im not sure if because of COVID the bathtubs were turned off so no jacuzzi. The refrigerators were empty however we put water in it and it locked had to call to have it opened.  I've have much better stays for less money.  I have worked in the hospitality field for 20 years In that time I managed for 5 years and did a small amount of time in Hotel Management. I was completely disappointed with the wore out Motel rooms.
50,Julia in the Diamond lounge was amazing. Very patient and met our needs to get our trip started right. She was able to get us in the room we wanted and I received a gift card to be used during the stay.
40,We received an upgrade. Room was nice but is showing wear. However staff and overall Caesars is great. Leslie was extremely helpful in getting us settled in. Love Caesars will stay there often. The current times have likely hurt Vegas-but it was kinda of nice to be able to see Vegas without the massive crowds. Things were limited but you could still enjoy Las Vegas.
20,Couldn‚Äôt wait to get home. Bed was broke horrible pillows mold in shower blood or poo on bathroom door stained carpet and couch smelled so bad. Didn‚Äôt get my $50 food and drink voucher. It wasn‚Äôt til the 3rd night that a cocktail waitress ( Nikki Skipper) actually offered me a drink. After her shift I wasn‚Äôt helped again afterwards.
10,Well I came to Vegas for the first time to celebrate my bday of 30 years old. I made plans to have the best time! So I booked ‚Äúthe best‚Äù hotel for 4 nights! Everything was so hard Bc the big lines and rules of corona virus! I respect all the rules even to go to the pool tan and wear a mask they threw me out of the pool for no reason! You have to wear a mask all the place u go! Just can take it out if u are sitting at restaurant. If u go to the pool u have to wear a mask ALL THE TIME even u just have u tan u still have to wear it! They told me I could be Inside the pool outside the mask but they threw me out the pool w the excuse I was without mask.. I didn‚Äôt get it ! They called me when I was inside the pool and I have to leave without reason and the told me if I did not leave they was going to call the cops! After 5 employees be around me all the people make a videos I left so upset! I didn‚Äôt nothing wrong I respected all the rules they made! I spoke to manager of the pool Kendrick Mills  that who throw me out the poll  and the front desk manager Sarah Dambrosia Both of them didn‚Äôt nothing ! The funniest thing was when I did the checkout and just w FEE ROOM I payed 5669 also plus RESORT FEE $51.02 plus the daily of 107.71 ! So everything so expensive and the service horrible. To use the cooler of the room was $75 they locked it w your stuff inside if u no willing to pay it ! Well I‚Äôm really upset I had embarrassment time! If u wanna have great time and relax ... may it‚Äôs no the best place to go!
20,Trip was good and room was nice until sewage began to back up into the sink. Took videos and pictures to show you management. When brought to their attention received credit for one nights resort fee.    During a pandemic and paying over 700 bucks for 3 nights for a premium studio room I didn't realize that the sanitation would be worse than staying at NYNY where I could have gotten a much cheaper room.    Disappointed all around. Had stayed one night a month before this trip and everything was great. So much so that I didn't go back to MGM where we have stayed the last 4 times this year and we payed the price.
10,I reserved 3 rooms and the 3 rooms that i got were in terrible condition they were very dirty the floor wasnt cleaned the bed had ripped sheets this was not what i expected nothing like the photos i would've rather stayed at a motel because those are cleaner than the room i would never recommend this place because of how bad the rooms were it did not seem like they cleaned the room at all. I talked to the manager about it and he was very rude and he charged me more money to move rooms in another buidling i was expecting amazing service knowing this was Carsars Palace but it wasnt.
20,We got there on Oct. 2 2020 and immediately checked out the mini bar .. of course overpriced. Two drinks were missing and they tried to charge me for it when I checked out. Front desk was doubting me so I was prepared to just pay for it. Shower was clogged water wasn't draining so you'd have to turn off the water and wait to drain otherwise water will overflow. Lamp on the table was flickering. One light overhead the bathroom sink was out. We had to keep switching off and on the light in the bathroom for the toilet light to turn on.
50,I received amazing service by Delano at check in. Delano was very polite and kind. Delano went beyond what I requested. Delano was able to wish me a happy birthday and make my experience extra special. I would hope that management would use him as an example of how customer service should be provided. I would defiantly stay here again.
20,I would have thought spending $800 on a room wouldn‚Äôt been superb. I had NO hot water for shower and the small tv buzzed the whole time. Couldn‚Äôt use the fridge for leftovers either. All the ‚Äúhidden‚Äù costs make it much more expensive than what it‚Äôs worth. Or at least that room it was
30,This hotel is all about waiting in line unless you are a diamond player. Even the pool only has a limited number of spaces and sometimes you can‚Äôt get in at all during the day.  From the moment we arrived and waited one hour to check in to coming down to the casino and trying to get a replacement players card everything is a long line and there‚Äôs clearly not enough staff with plenty of empty desks.  The Starbucks counter in the morning has an estimated 20 minute wait to get coffee.  This definitely impacted our stay and I can‚Äôt see myself coming back here again. The room was nice but it‚Äôs simply not worth it. Also the whole idea of not letting you check in till 4 PM even if the room is ready or paying a $50 early charge it‚Äôs just petty considering that they charge a resort fee for a pool we can‚Äôt get use. Finally WIFI service is awful it comes on and shuts off constantly.
30,"Listen I paid quite a bit to stay in Caesar's Palace and I was not impressed.    I'm going to be extremely honest and fair here with only observations. I will list the amazing things about this hotel and the not-so-amazing things.    Great location beautiful great dining with a food court! There is an actual mall inside the place they provided us with masks and kept everything clean! Super convenient since its on the strip!    Wifi is $14.99 per device after your first 2 nights. I paid for jacuzzi tub expecting a JACUZZI size tub and I received an extremely narrow bathtub with jets that my partner and I could barely move an inch in. It's NOT sexy to have to struggle over your partner's legs or arms to fit your own I am an average build and so is my partner... If I cannot fit in your tub the average person cannot. Google ""Star Island Resort"" Orlando that's what I was expecting for this price. I spend $118.00 a night to stay in Star Island and I get an entire apartment with a complete kitchen dining room and patio with a huge jacuzzi tub with STAIRS Roman columns and mirrors in the back of the bed area! This room had no kitchenette microwave or fridge. The ""fridge"" that was provided was filled with pressure/weight-sensitive triggers (meaning that if you move a small $22.00 grey goose bottle to fit your $120.00 Hell's Kitchen left-overs BAM -- you get charged). When you come back to the hotel under the influence of any substance those leftovers are a LIFESAVER. I wasted a lot money on food that way because I cannot force myself to eat larger portions normally let alone hungover sue me. NO ONE helped us with our bags and there were no baggage carts in sight. You would have had to find an employee to find one in the back room. I had quite a bit of luggage and it was HORRIBLE having to drag all the luggage to your room on the other side of the hotel. We were not greeted no ""hello"" from any of the staff the only time they spoke to me was to inspect if we had any glass before we entered the pool and take our temperatures. It was lovely to have a temperature screening before the check-in line it made me feel a bit safer with all of the COVID craziness going on. However after my partner's temperature was taken I did notice that the several wealthy-looking lighter-skinned individuals behind us were not scanned. My partner is black I am Hispanic and I apologize for not having my Louis Vuitton Madeleine Pumps on I don't usually wear them for flights"
50,We had a great stay in the Octavious Tower. Room was fine and beds were comfortable. Temperature was taken at Diamond check-in. Caesars' had sanitizer stations and masks. Gambling overall was good. Will be back for Thanksgiving
50,Amazing 2 nights Room clean staff very helpfull.Clean the price was perfect and will return soon..I recommend it.For couples or girls trip this is just perfect you will enjoy it Staff on point cleaning.
10,Did not set proper expectations. was told late checkout was complimentary. Was not told about another resort fee For late check out. When someone spends money for an expensive place setting proper expectations and transparency should be the standard.
50,After a long long day I went to check in at the front desk with Elpidio. My reservation was challenging as it was booked through American Express travel. I knew walking up to the front desk it would be challenging but Elpidio got it all taken care of and saved the day! His customer service is outstanding and has already made my stay so wonderful! I will be back because of Elpidio!
30,The hotel itself is nice aesthetically but our room had a couple holes and the rooms phone was completely broken had to go to the front lobby to ask for replacement towels and other things. It definitely wasn‚Äôt a bad experiencing but for the amount of money spent it wasn‚Äôt reallly worth it. I probably could have complained but it really wasn‚Äôt worth the hassle considering we weren‚Äôt staying in the room the whole time. I‚Äôd say spend less and go to a cheaper hotel that is similar in comparison
50,I am always blown away by the professionalism of the staff at Caesar‚Äôs. Everyone takes their time to listen to you they show empathy they are efficient and always have a smile on their face even when patrons are rude. I just spent five nights and had an excellent experience. Several members of the staff needs to be recognized. In the Diamond check-in area everyone is outstanding and unfortunately I can only remember two of their names; Eric and Conner. They helped fully accommodate my disabled mother who was traveling with me. Great personalities!    The Laural Lounges were closed(Covid) but we were granted four drinks a day to be used at different locations throughout the property. I used mine everyday at The Lobby bar the Best people watching spot in the joint! Ray Ray was an awesome bartender not only could he make all the fancy Singapore Slings and Palomas he also makes a damn solid Old Fashion. The waitresses were also very attentive. Mom is in a wheelchair and every time we came to the bar a waitress would push her up the ramp. All the waitresses were great and I have to tip my hat to Aneska Charli Julie Jessica and Andrea. Ha that‚Äôs a ton of them but when you get outstanding service and left with a favorable impression you remember their names! My mouth is watering just thinking about the speciality drinks!    I can not wait to go back to Caesar‚Äôs Palace! The management has done an amazing job in getting the right people on the bus! I am so glad they have been able to retain their top talent.. You truly feel like a Caesar at Caesar‚Äôs Palace.
30,Misinformation at front desk check-in made our checkout more difficult than it had to be. Bed was great window could‚Äôve been cleaned no working fridge still have to call back to sort out overcharge
50,Had such amazing food at Havana  definitely recommend. Best Mexican food in Dubai!üî•    Amazing staff really amazing ambience and music    Very classy venue perfect for dinner on that special date night .. dubai is a dream üòç
20,For paying over $200 a night I found Caesar‚Äôs Palace to be dirty and poorly cleaned. I was offered an extended stay for $30 and was charged $34.01. And that was just the charge no taxes included. Wtf? Anyway super over rated.
10,Checked into Caesars paid for an upgrad to our room. Got into the room and it REAKED of sewage and it was very hot. We turned down the air and hoped the smell would go away. Got back from the pool that was closed at 5:00pm (said it closed at 7pm) and the room was still hot. Called downstairs and asked to send someone up. It took 45 minutes to get someone to come upstairs to help us. They finally got up there and we were on the phone with the front desk trying to move room bc obviously we weren't a priority to them. The engineer left. Didn't wait for us to get off the phone. Went down to talk to a manager and the manager switched us to a different room lower and smaller then our upgraded room that we paid for. Went back up to the room to get all our things. Looked through the room to see what the smell was and guess what old moldy cake was left in the fridge that was off.......Called downstairs asked to be moved a to a room that we paid for. They sent a manager to our room to hand deliver new keys. He didn't tell us anything about where the room was located on the card it said 41st floor.... There was no 41st floor in the elevator. We called downstairs to see what 41st floor they are asking about and they said the 21st floor. And once again no 21st floor in that elevator..... Went downstairs my husband spoke with the manager again and we canceled our entire stay with them. She said that she write down everything that happened. I haven't gotten my money back and when I called the online company that we booked through Caesars Palace denied us and told them that we stayed there. Lol
10,I was told there are fridges in the room upon request prior to my trip I just need to request it when I arrive  I was also told I had guarantee early check in neither are true when I arrived they said no such thing as guarantee early check in I called several times and when I almost arrived to confirm only reason I got early check in is because the rep noted in my notes for my stay  there are no mini fridges at all only tiny fridges that fit meds that pissed me off that I was lied to was also told there is no bell hop called back prior to my trip found out that‚Äôs a lie there actually is bell hop and ballet  there is no room service during covid no one cleans ur room or your trash they don‚Äôt even put trash liners in the trash cans the manager also lied to me and told me she could check the calls but it would take two to three hours and she would get back to me I checked out at 5 am this morning the entire stay of three nights she never reached out to me she told me if I wanted a refund when I checked in so I could stay at another hotel why the hell would I want that it‚Äôs Friday last minute and the stay was for my birthday it gets better my boyfriend used the toilet and it would not flush we called the front desk they said there is no eta we have to wait and when maintenance comes we have to leave the room luckily they came in 30 minutes the girl had to replace parts 3 x for it work the panel was falling off the spa tub as well how ghetto I would expect this from a ghetto hotel like Excalibur or flamingo not caesers palace oh the pool u can‚Äôt even use u Need a reservation if it‚Äôs full your out of luck didn‚Äôt even get to use it don‚Äôt visit during covid words of advice clubs and shows are not open anyways
50,Eric is the guy to request at the front desk. Just wanted to get that out of the way. Every time I've visited (each month since June of 2020) I've been met with great service and wonderful smiles. The staff is friendly (Eric is the friendliest and most patient so far) and ready to help as much as the CDC will allow. They have restrictions that will keep you safe which are annoying but in lieu of everything the staff puts you first. I've loved each stay but I've felt the best when I've been met by Eric each time. If you're willing to follow the mask rule then your stay will be wonderful.
30,Room needed to be cleaned next am. Not vacuumed! Pool crazies only concern was masks while never wiping down lounge chairs! Really...masks outside big issue people changing lounge chairs...no biggie? Mushroom pizza in casino crazy good not too worried about cleaning the tables with only one staff person on the job! Most people sat down at used table. Final kicker was no comp offered for a in vacuumed room and hit with a resort fee for three days...surprise! Staff was super friendly and always busy working. Mask police at the ‚Äúoutside‚Äù pool ridiculous!
50,My trip was amazing. I‚Äôm in Vegas 20+ times a year and this trip blew me away.    James Stallings in the VIP dept went above and beyond ensuring my family was comfortable and enjoying their stay. He‚Äôs truly at asset to Caesars.
50,"So I have read the reviews before I went because of Covid and I was super worried. Then I realized that all these people complaining probably don't know Vegas.    We were upgraded to the palace tower which I totally recommend. Do not stay in once of the standard rooms they are outdated and nasty. Spend the money or be super nice to the front desk ($20 bill trick works). The rooms are amazing in this tower and the pool is right off the elevator.    The pool was great as well you have to get there early on Saturday and Sunday or else you may not get in but during the week was perfect. If you complaint that drinks are $20 by the pool... ITS VEGAS! That's just how it is! We had an amazing server who was the only one working and she busted her ass. We tipped her $100 for being so great. Reminder it's not the people who work there's fault covid ruined everything!  Oh and yes you have to wear the dang mask unless you are in the pool sucks but whatever just stay in the water.    Yes having to wear your mask everywhere sucks there will be someone to tell you to put it back on. The ""mask police"" as some are calling it they are doing their job to feed their family be respectful to them! You really think they want to chase you around acting like your mom?    Overall we had a great time and delt with the mask wearing. Just be a nice human being and respect that we are all dealing with the bull."
40,My cousin and I and decided that since we can work from anywhere we decided to work from Las Vegas for a week. I booked double queen at Caesar's Palace and airfare was also cheap so it made it all worthwhile.    When we arrived I checked in at the Diamond check-in and they were taking temperatures and only allowing a few people in at a time but we eventually got checked in. We were given a high floor in the Octavious tower.    When we arrive the room has a clean and sanitized sticker on the door and we broke the seal to enter. It was noted that once you enter the room there is no room service and I heard a few complaints about that from other guests but I was expecting it. You could leave dirty towels outside your door and they would replace it but that was the extent of it. I had asked for slippers after the fact but was told that this has to be asked before your arrival.    All in all it was fun as we worked during the day and went out at night. We did run into people smoking in the hallways of the hotel even though it was not allowed. They were enforcing mask-wearing and tables had limited chairs. We ate at Nobu one night and that was an incredible meal. It was a nice getaway and there are not a lot of poeple mid-week which is why I choose it.
40,Nice place fun would do it again. No daily housekeeping no biggie for me. Had to ask for extra toilet paper twice before it was finally delivered. Great view of the strip. The restraint is good. Nice folks.
20,Found used condom package on floor closed to bed smell like vomit close to drawer found hairs on carpet at 4am heard laughing and noise on air conditioning vent coming from another room looks they were having a party. Contacted security couldnt find source of noise. They offer me to change room at 4am but since I was going to check out this day I stayed they offered to extend my check out to 1 pm. Not great experience.
10,The front desk was useless. The hall way was heavy mariwana smell. Parking was costly. The gambling dealers were rude and disrespecful especially for English second language speakers. Bottom line: dont ever stay here even a walk for visit.
30,The palace premium room was beyond nice the jetted tub and double shower were awesome! $8 for a small bottle of water $40 for a mojito $70 for 4 slices of crap pizza and 2 drinks ( the only thing open at 9pm on Sunday - so much for the town that never sleeps!! The pool is only open 10-5 and is all of about 35 degrees everyone at the pool was complaining about it!! This property is so big get ready to hike a mile to do anything!!
50,Another great trip to Caesars Las Vegas. Great service from the get go at the Seven Stars lounge check-in by Eric who took the time to find me a high floor Bellagio fountain view and non smoking king bed in the August‚Äôs Tower (that he saw from my VIP reservation preferences). Also helped me secure my Nobu reservations. Great start to my trip!
50,For all this covid-19 stuff I think Cesear Palace did a GREAT job with social distancing hand sanitizing  And masks. and believe it or not people complied to it. At the pools the chairs have distance between them and not a lot at the pool either (though the pool water could have been warmer). The room was awesome and clean NO maid service unless you request. So woo hoo to them!!
50,Stayed at Caesars Palace for 1 night and Jay in the VIP Check in provided one of the friendliest and most informative check ins I have had. He went above and beyond to make sure I knew all the updates and changes with Covid and made sure I had a great stay. Thanks Jay for making a rough morning 10x better.
30,We stayed a couple nights at Caesar‚Äôs Palace at the end of August. Upon first glance everything looked fine but as we started to settle in we began noticing cleanliness issues in the room as well as some lighting issues. We found a pair of dark colored socks that were not ours along with candy and garbage under the couch which were also not ours..gross. I could see how they possibly could have missed them seeing as it was very dark in our room and one of the lamps was not working. Front desk staff were not readily available so instead we just checked out at a kiosk because we needed to catch a flight. I did however write the hotel to notify them of the issues. I have yet to receive a response back it has almost been a month. I never expect hotels to be perfect but I felt as if our room could have been much cleaner. Other than that our short stay was nice hotel itself is very beautiful.
50,Birthday getaway... Although there were some hiccups at the beginning of the trip I‚Äôd have to say that the trip was pretty amazing! Mehret was very pleasant to talk to and answered all of my questions and made sure I was happy for the duration of my stay. We ended up choosing to upgrade to the spa suite and couldn‚Äôt have been more pleased! I will definitely be asking for her on our next stay. And you should always see what upgrades are available üòâ
20,I have visited many times and this trip was by far the worst. Check in time was 4 and my room wasn‚Äôt ready until 10 pm. I paid for a view room and it was facing the freeway and parking lot. The pool service took over an hour to take our order after I had paid 225.00 for a reserved day bed. I played a lot of money and comps were horrible.
10,I was really looking forward to staying At Cesars Palace I was highly disappointed in the customer service! We got put in a room on a non smoking floor( we wanted) and ended up with clouds of weed smoke in our room every night! When it was brought to staffs attention basically nothing happened- they sent security up and the people wouldn‚Äôt answer the door. So if you want to stay somewhere that you‚Äôre nothing breathing in weed fumes- don‚Äôt stay here. If you have an issues don‚Äôt expect anything to be done. They‚Äôve clearly lowered their standards and this is not acceptable.
20,Guests were mostly thugs and obese people. This place used to have class. Not anymore. Very sad and disgusting. Drinks were $20+. Eggs and bacon were $29. We couldn‚Äôt wait to get out of there. Will never return.
20,We booked a weekend trip for our Anniversary and my Birthday the weekend of September 18th. The normal drop off area was closed with police no direction was given where to park - just a security guard that looked at us like we were challenged. It took 30 minutes to figure out where to park and then a good 15 minute walk to find the check in area. Then we were told to do the self check in but the system wouldn‚Äôt accept our check in so we stood in line anyway. We stayed in a suite in the Augustus tower and we were told that was the reason why - shouldn‚Äôt you tell us that before we stand in line for an hour? Our room was the highlight of our stay but also a major problem. We understand that recreational Marijuana is legal and that shouldn‚Äôt be a reflection on Cesars but the smell was so strong we needed to close half of our suite off to control the smell - we are not complainers but it was terrible. Then we went to the pool and were told that we needed to text a number we did that and when i asked how long the wait would be the attendant said ‚Äúprobably tomorrow‚Äù. That was the disappointment of the weekend. After an hour of asking for the pool manager etc a day bed became available and we paid for it and then we were told ‚Äúsorry it has been double booked‚Äù. The pool staff did get us an upgrade to a Cabana which was much appreciated but we lost an hour working through that opportunity. The larger pool was as cold as Lake Michigan like ice wouldn‚Äôt melt. The bar pool felt heated. Anyway this was a multi thousand dollar weekend filled with frustration. I understand we are living in a COVID world but all we needed was a little communication to be able to manage our time and expectations better. Our last frustration was the inability for my wife to stay at the BlackJack table because of social distancing - again we understand COVID but nothing was said until I had $300 in chips on the table.
50,I was(am) staying at Caesar's Palace and I am very pleased with the Hotel the staff and the location. I extended my stay only hours before checkout where Tangela at the reception desk was VERY NICE HELPFUL AND COURTEOUS and helped me exted my stay and keep the same room. She made my Vegas experience that more memorable.
50,I‚Äôve always enjoyed staying with Caesars as the amenities are in a class of their own. The convenience to be centrally located to so many restaurants the strip and stores is the main attraction. Although I had one small issue with check-in Jay the front desk team member was incredibly professional kind and understood my issue quickly. Due to his service I‚Äôd love to stay at Caesars again.
50,We had a blast at Caesar. The concierge was the best we had a few little hiccups with some of our amenities that they corrected right away. I also had a few questions during our stay the were addressed. They were so responsive.  The gentleman who helped us at the front Desk was also wonderful very patient went over every room with us and addressed the questions that we had. That means a lot when you are spending your hard earned money
10,Our room was broken into and my girl friend‚Äôs purse was stolen. Security help was poor. They had her fill out a report and checked our door lock from then on nothing. We had to talk to a new security guard and the desk manger to be told to call the police. We thought they would have done that themselves or told us too when we reported the theft. When the desk manger spoke to us she had the wrong information and times. It took a lot of questioning on our part to get them to get their story right. Las Vegas Metro Police did a great job one they took over the investigation. Very disappointed in a company of this size not having a better handle on security process. Won‚Äôt be back or recommend Caesars properties.
40,We came here from Kansas city to visit family. I stayed at caesers in the past so wanted to stay here again I work in health care so i wanted to ensure id be able to social distance. I was very please with their protocol on cleaning it made me feel comfortable due to covid. They provided masks & hand sanitizer which was awesome. Super friendly employees! Will be coming back soon!! Keep up the amazing work!
20,I am honestly so disappointed in my stay at Caesars Palace I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had a worse stay anywhere. From start to finish it was a terrible experience. Poor customer service it was like none of the employees wanted to be there or do they‚Äôre jobs. I will never go back to a Caesars property.
50,I come back to Caesars every year because of Tangela she‚Äôs helped me for 25 years but this year Karla helped me because Tangela was not working that Sunday. They are both great so it‚Äôs worth mentioning.
50,We stayed here for 4 days during their WSOP tournament promotion. Since we are still in the midst of pandemic everything is changed. All valet staff is wearing mask. At the entry to the casino there is hand sanitizer station and mask. There are many security staff to make sure everyone keeping their masks on. If your mask slipped down just a few seconds these guys will be on your case!    We got upgraded to premier suite in Palace tower. Can I say ow!!! The suite is gorgeous and huge! Walking to living room and dining room with city view through a french door to our bed room with big king bed and sofa flat screen TV jack and jill bathroom and tub!  All their room is sealed after cleaning. Toiletries are in sealed package. There is a fridge in the room but with alcohol and drinks which you don't want to touch... one slight move you will be charged. There is no coffee maker in room. There is no ice machine nor vending machine on this floor. You will need to get down the other floor to get ice.    We did extend an extra day stay so they moved us to Augustus tower. Augustus and Octavius tower are closer to the main entrance and have their own check-in desk. They are however a walking distance from the pool and restaurants. The room is good size with sitting area and wraparound sofa. Our room was on 45 th floor with the Bellagio fountain view.    Most of their restaurants are opened for dining pick up or delivery. We did order to delivery through their website. They do charge 20% for delivery fee.    The pool is opened but you will need to make reservation online or wait in line for first-come-first-serve since they limit number of patrons to the pools. You do have to wear mask at the pool unless you are in the water.    Overall we had a great time here. All staff are helpful and excellent. The place is very clean which gives us peace of mind to travel during the pandemic. We definitely will come back soon.
20,I'm at the casino now (leave tomorrow) and so upset with the pool and pool service I have to write this review now. The wait staff at the pool MIGHT stop by once every 45 minutes (if they don't outright ignore you) two drinks will set you back $70 and ice water is $4. I get it...its Vegas and going to be expensive but the pools are ICE COLD and there is absolutely NO EXCUSE for the poor service. Read the other reviews regarding service. Suffice to say I'll never come back to Caesars Palace. MANAGEMENT: how about you read these reviews get out of our air conditioning office and see how TERRIBLE your service and then...here is a novel idea....FIX IT!
30,"Not our first stay at caesars but will be our last. We booked with the healthcare worker discount which was a nice touch so I was able to get a fairly upgraded room for a good price. When we arrived the line was insanely long so was did the self check in it was before 4pm so they charged us $50 to check in around 1:30pm worth it not to wait in that line and argue with someone or stand around with our bags for hours. We got to our Octavius Tower Room and it had a very nice side view of the fountains which was a nice touch. Seemed like the room was turned over in a rush. The ice bucket was wet. The window was filthy with children handprints the mini bar was almost completely empty with a half empty bottle of pepsi which is gross. They left two body lotions and a shampoo. No body wash or conditioner. You only get two wifi devices for free the rest are 14.99 per device per day which is just an annoying way to nickel and dime people. There is a texting service that texts you when you arrive which is nice. I asked for wine glasses to be sent to our room they never came. I called concierge and I was placed on hold and then the call timed out. I texted the service again and they said they would send some up about an hour later I got 4 extra bathroom glasses in a bag never got any wine glasses.    Pool: We booked a ""scoop"" at the Neptune pool online because I heard it has hard to get in. pool opened at 9am small line maybe 10 minute wait to check in for those with reservations. Someone walked us over to our ""scoop"" by the rectangular pool which was very nice. They didn't let people without reservations to that particular pool so it was pretty private which was nice. There was a waitress out there who got us drinks starting around 9:30 that was nice. We stayed until 1pm. It was worth it to have a place to sit and relax away from the crowds at the smaller pools. Scoop was very comfortable.    We are staying at the Wynn next time."
50,Will for sure stay there again. Very clean and comfortable. Stayed 3 nights and still didn't get to see all of it. It is huge very clean and the help was very nice and helpful. Will for sure be back.
50,Mehret was so kind and helping during my check-in process! I had a long travel day and the check-in process was smooth as can be. I would recommend staying here if you want a stress free trip. There is also a sweet pool.
10,My two girlfriends and I all live in different states so we were excited to meet up for a girls weekend at one of our (formerly) favorite places to stay Caesar‚Äôs Palace. With Covid-19 restrictions we assumed we would need to wear our masks and social distance as much as possible which we were fine with.    The first problem started when we arrived for check in. We pulled up and were informed if we wanted our car valeted it would cost us $35/night! So over the course of our stay almost $150 for someone to park our car. We declined and decided to self park. Then we had to haul all of our luggage from the self park lot all the way to the registration desk to check in. Then we got our keys and and hauled our bags up to our room.    Our door had a sticker on it saying it was cleaned and sanitized. The carpet was ripped and had crumbs on it and the shower had a used bandaid in it stuck to the wall!! Talk about nasty.    It was 100¬∞‚ÄîSeptember in Vegas so we were excited to spend some time by the pool. We stopped at a little shop to get a bottle of water and a soda. A bottle of water was $8! Soda was $4. Water. $8. Then there‚Äôs a sign as we are walking into the pool no outside drinks. We bought the water in Caesars at a little store right by the pool entrance! We were in our swimsuits in the morning clearly headed to the pool and did the cashier inform us we wouldn‚Äôt be able to take our $8 water in? No. In fact she took five minutes as we stood there waiting to give her my credit card to pay to pour all her change into the cash register.    We wore our masks out to the pool and when we got to our chairs we sat down and removed our masks. Within two minutes a server approached us and told us to put our masks on. We were surprised since we were outside and six feet from the nearest person. But we knew it wasn‚Äôt the server‚Äôs fault so we put our masks on.    It was lunchtime so we asked for a menu. The menu options were a couple sandwiches a wrap or two and a couple salads. Super limited. We decided to just get some Virgin Daiquiris. Well the waitress then informed us the strawberry Daiquiri machine was broken. So then we were like okay I guess we will take three Virgin pina coladas. So i take off my mask to take a drink from my drink and the security guard immediately comes over and says ‚Äúma‚Äôam your mask has to be on your chin.‚Äù I said ‚Äúexcuse me? I‚Äôm drinking my drink.‚Äù He said ‚Äúit needs to be on your chin.‚Äù I said ‚Äúwhat good does it do on my chin? It isn‚Äôt covering my mouth or my nose...‚Äù he said ‚ÄúI understand that ma‚Äôam you still have to have it on your chin.‚Äù I‚Äôm sorry what?! The bill comes and it is $60! For three Virgin pina coladas.    So then we are super annoyed sweating to death can‚Äôt breathe from the stupid masks so we decide we will take a dip in the pool to cool off. So we go and step down on the first step into the pool and oh my gosh SO cold!! Literally freezing! Not just a bit on the chilly side this was ice cold.    So we sit on the side of the pool and put our feet in. Within 30 seconds the lifeguard is telling us we have to have our masks on. I mean it‚Äôs getting to the point that it feels like we are being bullied. Don‚Äôt worry a lady across the way was smoking her cigarette did she have a mask on her chin? No. Can she blow her second-hand smoke in the air for everyone around her to breathe in? Apparently that‚Äôs fine. But we can‚Äôt sit on the side of the pool with our feet in the ice water without a mask.    So we said ‚Äúwe thought in the pool it was okay to take off our masks?‚Äù The lifeguard says ‚Äúyou have to be fully immersed in the pool‚Äù so basically move four inches forward and stick your entire body in ice water and Covid can‚Äôt get you!    This has been a ridiculous experience. They‚Äôre jacking up the prices of everything and cutting costs at our expense. Guess what Caesars if you are going to force everyone to be in your pool in order to breathe turn the damn heater on.    You‚Äôve completely lost site of what hospitality actually means. Here‚Äôs the definition for you: hos¬∑pi¬∑tal¬∑i¬∑ty    the friendly and generous reception and entertainment of guests visitors or strangers.    There was nothing friendly or generous about the experience we had here. We will never return. Do better. Remember who keeps you in business.
20,Caesars Palace is a fantastic property with wonderful rooms. However they were lacking in the beverage servers on the casino floor. I stayed for 4 nights in September over Labor Day weekend and the beverage service was atrocious. I would play for stints up to 5 hours and not get one drink. It did not help that you could not go to bar for a drink either. I would have thought the management would want to take care of the customers that actually came during the pandemic rather than save a few dollars on labor and liquor cost.
40,Great location with a view of the strip and dancing fountain. Handicap accessible room furniture need to be update to higher sitting chairs and sofa. Otherwise very roomy - scooter chair turn around with ease. Bell Desk on point with scooter chair rental and replacement. Thank you Eric in Guest Service for making our visit excellect.
50,checked in Friday Sept. 11th. The most wonderful front desk agent Delano helped us with a fantastic upgrade. He was just wonderful and polite and so friendly. Love him. The room was amazing - 42nd floor with view all the way to the Stratosphere. Food in restaurant is very expensive so we only ate a couple meals there. Stayed 4 nights. Only negative to this trip was how absolutely freezing cold it was in the casino. Shivered every day. It was the only casino where we needed a jacket - and we went to all of them. Very fun and great time. Can't wait to go back. And hope Delano checks us in again. Eat at Joe's stone crab. Fantastic. Also masks are mandatory every where. Don't forget yours.
10,We came with a friend the day 16th September 2020 (today in the morning we are still here). They gave us 2 cards (the room's keys). In the afternoon we went to the pool and then my friend stayed and I decided to come back to the room. I realized my card was not working. I went to the front desk and after asking one of the girls that was working there she told me she cannot help me and if I need something I had to do the line (maybe 30 people waiting for the check in) so they gave me a card that didn't work and also she wanted me do the line. I asked for the person in charge a woman came and told me one of the securities was gonna meet me in my room door to help me with this problem. I have been waiting for 30 minutes none showed up and I went back to the front desk to ask what happen. So I went back and the same girl told me they had a problem and that's why none showed up. She sent a security guy again who told me that with this kind of problems they don't show up fast I have had another kind of problem they use to go faster. My worst experience in many many years in hotels even hotels of 1 stars give the people a better attention. I don't recommend this place at all. Last detail : they charge 30 dollars for a drink in the pool crazy...
10,If you want to Check-in before 4PM.....ITS GONNA COST YA !!! $75.00 on top of your resort fees!! Even though there‚Äôs practically ZERO % occupancy in Las Vegas right now except the slight uptick on Friday and Saturday. Monday-Thursday it‚Äôs practically a ghost town so that ‚Äú FEE‚Äù is just money grab. The hotel is practically empty!! There‚Äôs NO minibars in the room the Infamous CESARS PALACE Pool is ICE COLD right now to the point it‚Äôs not swimmable. Also I understand fully BUT the Mask nazis are out and about on their power trips. If you go 30 seconds without a mask there‚Äôs a guard waiting to crawl all over you about it...The Augustus Tower room we got had a nice view (that‚Äôs all it had) They go on and on about how ‚Äúclean‚Äù the rooms are with their ‚Äúclean‚Äù stickers all over everything ... well I beg to differ. My bar of soap ended up with a wad of hair from the floor of the shower and some disgusting film in my tub... the furnishings are worn and the beds in the ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù rooms are atrocious...The extremely scarce bar option in the casino ‚ÄúREQUIRES‚Äù you to buy an appetizer to have a drink unless you‚Äôre some triple Diamond Platinum BS status if you are they only require you to buy a bag of chips.  There‚Äôs many other hotels along the strip that are exponentially better right now..... AVOID Cesars Palace!!
10,So disappointed in Caesars signature hotel. Furniture and carpet was filthy and scratched up. Non smoking room smelled like an ashtray. Everything is outdated and old! Wallpaper peeling off. Don‚Äôt stay here! The room is not like the pictures online. Employee only offered to fix the broken curtain and couldn‚Äôt switch rooms.
30,The hotel itself this time was very busy but everyone seemed very strict on mask wearing which was great. We stayed in the Julius tower and the elevator floors were dirty most of the time we were going up and down though. I also got stuck in the elevator for over an hour and had to wait for help to get me out. Because of that the starbucks was closed and I had a harder time redeeming my drinks as a Diamond plus member. Overall hoping the hours for Starbucks picks back up since there seems to be at max capacity for whatever the state is allowing in terms of people. The room and the location is great it was just the common areas could use more cleaning. Also with both starbucks not in operation there were long lines.
50,Enjoyed a long weekend at Caesars. Second time staying with them. While we usually stay across the street at some of the more moderately priced hotels we stepped it up to Caesars. Very nice stay. Staff was friendly accommodations were first class and much less chaos to deal with. Will return. Had two excellent days at the pool (although the water was like ice...literally don't think ice would have melted in it).    Only issue we had was the new Sportsbook manager's app did not work during the first set of NFL games which was the reason we went out. We were pretty bummed. Little disappointed in the response of the book staff as they didn't seem to care at all it was an issue. Not sure they even apologized. Hope Caesars didn't make a mistake subbing out the sportsbook to another company.
10,Terrible experience from the get go. Waited for hours upon arrival for our room to be ready. Did not even get a message or email to let us know if/when our room would be ready. So we came back to the hotel to follow up only to be told that our room was not ready yet? Check in was scheduled at 4pm and we did not get into the room until about 6pm! Add to that a shower that leaked through the entire bathroom hazardously and a broken tap!  I can‚Äôt believe we still had to pay a ‚ÄòResort and Service fee‚Äô for such a disappointing service and experience. We will certainly not go there in future.
10,We recently stayed at Caesars Palace to celebrate my 50th Birthday and had to change our room twice before we received a clean room. 3rd Time‚Äôs a charm? The first room was absolutely disgusting to the point of where I would not even sit on the furniture. There were stains on the couch the desk chair and the baseboards were all damaged and had black smudge lines down an entire wall. Then we discovered a broken glass in the bathroom along with pulls all over the carpet. It looked used and abused. Caesars also confirmed this was one of their ‚Äúnewly renovated‚Äù rooms.    The second room we were given was extremely dusty and did not look like it had been cleaned for months. The bathroom shower door had grime on it and the mirror didn‚Äôt seem like it was wiped down for weeks. There was a gunky splotch on the counter. The desk chair also had stains on it but not as bad as the first room. The views of the pool were great from the first two rooms but the windows haven‚Äôt been cleaned for awhile... not even on the inside. We were finally given a little bit larger room on the 11th floor. It was clean but smelled like maple syrup    Overall the customer service at this hotel was unacceptable. It took us over an hour to check in. Then when we had issues with the rooms both my husband and I had to go and get keys for the new rooms. It was a big hike from the Palace Tower to the front desk. They didn‚Äôt offer any comps or offer to upgrade us.    The pool area was really nice. Plenty of staff checking to make sure everyone was wearing masks and social distancing. The pool temperature was freezing but was very clean.    I really expected so much more from this hotel. I‚Äôve stayed at several hotels in Vegas but was never more disappointed with my experience at Caesars Palace. The hotel staff needs much better customer-service training a cleaning crew that understands that they are not cleaning a motel.
20,Don‚Äôt waste your money here because it‚Äôs nothing special. I will not stay here again. Spent so much money for 3 nights for no amenities that were listed on the booking. Rude customer service that doesn‚Äôt care whether their customers are happy or not just want every dollar you have. Working my butt off on the frontlines of Covid to take a nice vacation but the stay here was our worst experience. Definitely will be booking elsewhere next time
10,I am so disappointed. Its been probably 20yrs since i stayed at Ceasars and what used to be a glamorous hotel is now an overbooked generic hotel where you are just one in 10's of thousands walking miles thru a COVID cesspool. We planned a stop to break up our drive on the way to Bryce. After a massive trek to check in there was a 30min wait to check in a $50 early checkin fee at 2pm then oh psych not rooms avail. Why dont you go wait by the pool you say next long trek in the COVID gauntlet and oh wait there is a 10hr wait to get into the pool so if we feel like a 1 am dip we are all good. Ridiculous. The manager Katie was very nice and without hesitation agreed to cancel our room psych again i ended up getting charged even though we didnt stay there. And dont expect Hotels.com to support you in a refund. 7 days of emails chats phone calls and still no refund. Never again.
20,Our Vegas stop ... on way home from the Grand Canyon was hoped to bring some fun after limited access to the Canyon. Our Vegas experience has boiled down to this view from our room at 9 pm Used to last a weekend in Vegas w/half as much $ as they took in a few short hours this time - making up for their Covid losses on foolish people like us. Wins have vanished to history. Want a drink? Start hoofing it to your room because the bars aren‚Äôt open for purchases - and those famous free Vegas drinks? Lmao. I saw a single waitress in a huge casino. No shows or entertainment. Valet is available to Seven Stars and Diamond players - those who fork over thousands and get nothing in return. Then they charge handsomely. Need cash? ATM fee is $9.99 cashier - $45.45 for $1000. They don‚Äôt miss an opportunity to grab your dough - it‚Äôs ‚Äúfun‚Äù right? Cancelled plans to come New Years. If you do just hand them your money at the door. What‚Äôs the point going inside?
50,Very pleased and happy with my stay here. Started at check-in Mehret was very polite and helpful. She upgraded me to a beautiful room at the palace towers when I least expected it. The pool was freezing cold lol but refreshing overall!
10,It was the worst trip to Vegas ever I had to check out of the hotel and go to the flamingo massage Friday night they gave me the wrong room and on top of that it took him three hours to get my luggage to me and they called me three times for my baggage claim number I do not recommend staying there It was my anniversary and Caesars Palace messed it all up
30,Some have commented about how cold the pools are and this is among my primary motivators fit writing this review and I hope serves as a warning to you to seek out other accommodations if lounging by the pool is a priority.    The pool is spacious and I will give them kudos for the pool towels which are probably the best pool towels I‚Äôve ever encountered at a resort. And the young woman who served is at the pool was very nice and remembered my name the next day.    My needs are this we specifically selected the Augustus Tower and paid a premium price for it. The website says this is conveniently located near the pool and the front desk. While it is close to the front desk it is not Close to the pools and this is because of Covid restrictions. You have to walk all the way around the perimeter of the casino‚Äôs restaurants and shops and enter the pool complex from the Palace tower. One in our party has back and leg issues and this trek was very time consuming and inconvenient and quite frankly I saw no meaningful reason for it.    The other issue is that the pool temperature is startlingly cold and in fact frigid is probably not harsh enough to describe it. What the heck?!!!! I‚Äôm paying $50+ per night for a resort fee and I can‚Äôt eve use the pool!?!! Everyone was complaining and even little kids who are resilient about these things were just putting their feet in the water because they were having none of it! It was really disappointing and sad to see.    When I complain to the lifeguards about the temperature of the pool I was met with glossed over stares which did not invoke any empathy on their behalf. I then contacted Guest Services by calling them poolside via my cell phone. What a lackluster crew they are. They encouraged me to mention the temperature issues to the lifeguards. I told them that was futile and asked for the Recreation Manager or the Manager on Duty. This conversation went nowhere and I got tired of beating my head against the wall so I tossed in the towel literally (I threw the tower to the pool). I did fish it out but I was well past my frustration level.    I spent about 90 dollars on one round of drinks and would probably have spent four times that amount of the pool temperature was tolerable. I get it some days are hotter in Vegas than others but is it so hard to heat the pool overnight??? This is nothing but an energy savings stunt. I guess my resort fee covers pools but not satisfactory pool temperatures    The resort acts like they‚Äôre crippled from Covid and I agree there are impacts but most lounges were closed unless they serve food. Some of the better restaurants were closed or open only on the weekends. Some are only open two nights a week. Why bother?    The website said my room was recently renovated. If this is true and I highly doubt it is then the decorating department should be dismissed. The hallways however were quite magnificent and I wish that decor had bled into my room.    A few good things. The Americano restaurant by the front desk is quite good but very pricey. The portions are huge and food quality is high. The staff was also professional patient and nice. The hostess in the lobby bar was also very friendly.    I wish o could say that I‚Äôd return here again but I can‚Äôt see that happening until they stop taking the resort fee for granted and actually manage their facilities and look at things from a guest.‚Äôs point of view. I hope the poor disinterested lifeguards and pool attendants get some new management because they seem very unhappy and disinterested.
50,Beautiful property. I stayed in the Palace tower because I wanted a newly remodeled room not just refurbished. The room was fabulous. I did have a King studio room that had a pool view and two bathrooms. The room was really new. The only thing I can mention is the carpet layers put the seam in the wrong place. It was at the side of the bed so it was the first thing I saw when I went to bed and the first thing I saw when I got up. The seam itself would not have been bad except it was coming apart and strings hanging out. Probably the house keeper should have mentioned this to the supervisors so it can be fixed. However I would stay there again.
50,We arrived at Caesar's about 3 pm and went to check in. Ralphie at the front desk helped us. We were staying in the Augustus tower and Ralphie upgraded us to a nice room on the 37th floor. The room was spacious and mostly clean but not much of a view. The previous occupant had left a glass of liquid and empty liquor bottle in the otherwise empty mini bar refrigerator. We did not complain just took the items out and placed them on the counter to be cleaned later no maid service for the 2 days we stayed due to Covid. After we got home I checked the exit folio and saw that we had a mini bar charge. It took me 4 calls to Caesars to get the charge reversed ugh. Also quite a long walk from self parking to the Augustus rooms.
30,We went for my birthday month celebration. Being in quarantine for the past six months I was excited to get away but also realized it might not be as busy considering COVID restrictions. We booked our room online and received Essential Service Worker discount which was nice. At check in they take your temperature. The lobby was quiet around 1:30pm and an early check in costs an additional $50. Daily resort fee is $45. Our ‚Äústrip view room‚Äù was on the 44th floor. The window view was nice but there is a giant X through the large window obstructing a full view. The refrigerator has a warning note that if you utilize it to cool personal items there will be a $75 fee. We peeked inside to see what goodies it held- nothing was inside and it was actually not even on. I called the front desk to check if this was an error they informed us the refrigerator was not on due to COVID restrictions. Oddly enough they charged us on two separate days for mini bar charges. Luckily my husband caught it and they removed the charges. How they could charge us for items from the mini bar when they told us it was shut off because of COVID doesn‚Äôt make any sense. We go to find the ice machine on our level- it was not working- we had to go to another floor level. I called front desk and they informed me it would be fixed by the evening (it was). Checked out the pool- two of the three entrances were blocked off and routed us to the main entrance to access the pool. Of the 3 pools we saw one was only for those that rented a cabana. The other two were open. You must wear a mask as you sit on your chair lying out. It must be above the nose and only under chin if you are drinking. After taking a sip of your drink- it needs to go back up. If you forget there are several security guards to remind you. You can take the mask off once inside the pool but not if you are sitting on the side. There is red lines of tape that restrict you from sitting on them in order to minimize gathering on the pool edge. The pool is freezing (how is it not heated?) so getting inside the pool is almost impossible. I dreamt of enjoying a nice frozen drink and asked for a pina colada. No frozen/blended drinks. They can only pour over ice for you. Ordered a large sangria and margarita totaled $58. Husband played blackjack and I was unable to observe him playing to limit gatherings. They kindly asked me to either play or leave. Finding a place to eat is not easy- multiple sit down restaurants shut down. The food court only offers smash burger or a pizza place. The other 5 are closed down.
20,This hotel is completely overrated! Don't stay in Palace Tower! Its a few miles of a walk to the front every day. Our room was dirty they had to send an engineer up because our sinks were missing drain caps! No refrigerator. Just horrible. I've stayed at other hotels that were waaay better for a fraction of the price. Oh and lets not forget.. it took over 8 hours for us to get into the pool; the wait list was outrageous! Never again!
50,From the Limo pick-up to the VIP check-in our stay was as good as it could be during Covid times. Check-in we had Debub assist us and she was excellent. Limited menus at restaurants but the food was great. The Pools just beautiful. Rented a Cabana and had the biggest one. Had a ball. Big shout out to Daniel he made my stay at the Pool everyday better. Always very attentive.  All in all if your going to Vegas Caesars is top notch. Suite was beautiful.
10,Worst hotel and casino on the strip. Way over priced. Old hotel. Stinks like weed. No room service during covid. No pool access even if you register before 7 am. Not going to recommend this hotel to anyone and never coming back to it.
40,My hubby surprised me with a 3 night 4 day trip to Las Vegas‚Äôs. Our room was in the Octavius Building on the 10th floor. Although we overlooked the highway we had a clear view of Paris Hotel and the Bellagio. We watched the water show from our hotel. We did find that there was no where to sit down unless it was at a slot machine gamblers table or in a restaurant. We bought snacks from the pharmacy across the toad as we could not find prices for the snack bar in room. Travelers should know that it was cold in December..and all pools are closed. The Christmas decor in many resorts was beautiful but the Bellagio was stunning. We did not enjoy ‚Äúold Vegas‚Äù. Overall fabulous trip. Please see photo taken from our room.
20,From checking in it was a headache to taking the kids swimming 4-5 hour wait.  My suite didn‚Äôt even have a mini fridge for personal storage. Not to mention being stuck in my room due to some kind of malfunction with the only elevator that lead to the 15th floor. Overall i am disappointed with the hotel experience!
50,Hugo was super helpful getting us checked in and got us and our party awesome rooms on the same tower! The food and pool were great as always we will be back soon I‚Äôd not? Definitely for the super bowl I‚Äôm January!
10,we were invited by our casino host and were looking forward to a nice enjoyable stay. We were attacked by bed bugs and our trip was ruined we have traveled all over the world and never have i experienced this! Stay away!!
50,Amazing staff were so friendly and welcoming. Everything was spotless and our room was awesome we were able to upgrade our room at a discounted rate which was awesome and we had a view of the pools can not wait to come back!
30,Ugh. So many things that aren‚Äôt up to par. And I know about COVID hotels as I have been at the Venetian the Encore in the past 6 weeks. The hotel at Caesars is fine my room was fine as expected. But no water in the room or at check in or at the pool. It‚Äôs only 112 degrees don‚Äôt worry!  No recognition of Diamond status no comparison to the similarly priced Encore and Venetian. At those resorts it didn‚Äôt feel like there were restrictions at Caesar‚Äôs everything took longer and was more effort. Not worth it .
50,First time staying at Caesar‚Äôs Palace. Modern updated room was very clean and comfortable. All stores casino areas seven pools and dining areas maintained social distance recommendations. I had fun never felt uncomfortable being a solo traveler and spent my days by the beautiful pool. Every member of the Caesar‚Äôs staff were polite and professional. Big shoutout to the pool servers -those ladies never stopped in record heat.  It was my good luck to meet Senior Director of Hotel Operations Adam Miller. He politely asked me about my stay. I explained how Hurricane Laura delayed my return a couple days. Much to my surprise I was upgraded to a beautiful suite with the best views! Join the Caesar‚Äôs Rewards and go!
40,"Beautiful room cleaned bigfabulous snack bar. Wish I could stay way longer. For sure planned to stay next time. The only ""bad"" thing was that in the shower the water was getting clogged just a bit. Other than that everything was great. Thank you."
10,There was something wrong with our room three times which caused the whole day walking back-and-forth to the front desk. Then on the second day we came back with some delicious chicken tacos from cheesecake factory to find out we were locked out of our room and have to go back down to the front desk to exchange keys I don‚Äôt like eating cold food !
10,We got here.. had no idea where to park.. no one could help us.. called for help.. got someone on the phone who had no idea.. finally found a parking spot.. walked over a mile with heavy luggage.. trying to find the lobby.. no one could or would help us.. finally found the lobby.. got to our room.. it was literally 90 degrees in our room.. we were hot tired and exhausted... it took almost 2 hours to park and get our room.. went down stairs to find dinner.. by this time it was 8:45pm.. walked another mile.. no one could help us find some where decent to eat.. decided to eat at the food court.. the food was so horrible.. we threw it away and went up to bed.. Worst stay ever.. would NEVER recommend this place.. no customer service.. no help.. no one willing to help us find anything... unbelievable.. we had never been here.. really expected more.. Too exhausted to gamble.. so disappointing.. really wanted to have fun..
10,Usually great experience. Woke up with bite marks around my legs . Looked like bed bugs. They apologized.. Not good enough. I'm itchy and have red spots on my legs! Now need to sanitize my stuff. Usually I have a nice room and time here.. Maybe Paris next time.
20,I realize some things were due to Covid. A full cleaning of the room daily not being done due to Covid is understandable. However I do think that taking the trash and fresh towels could still be done. I was never able to access the rewards app. It would not recognize my password and I never received an email to change it. Tried multiple times to order DiFaro‚Äôs Pizza from my room and finally had to go all the way down and walk through the entire hotel to get dinner from there. The room was warm even though we had the thermostat set to 60 degrees. No fan was available. The TV kept consistently pixilating.
20,I don‚Äôt ask for much but I NEED coffee in the morning and the rooms are void of coffee machines. I called down to have a coffee machine delivered and they instructed me to the Starbucks in the lobby. The Starbucks had a line of 20 frustrated people. I did this routine for 3 days straight. Even Super 8s provide coffee machines. Give me a break.
20,I really don't appreciate how the host treated me. There was more then one occasion my boyfriend tripped on the carpet in the hallway to our room because its lifted up in spots not tightened down. The Rio is by far better then Ceasars. Was very disappointed on the room and the treatment by the host
20,I thought Caesars Palace was going to be a nice place to visit. Wrong!! The room was small furniture is old velvet. The wood pieces are scraped and damaged. Shower and toilet had been used. The clock doesn‚Äôt work. Customer service is awful. They did nothing to help our stay.
50,Laylyse (I‚Äôm probably spelling her name wrong my bad!) she was SOOO wonderful and beyond helpful! She was such a sweetheart she definitely made our trip so much better our room was incredible thanks to her! She works in VIP services she was such a pressure and can‚Äôt wait to see her again! üôÇ
30,"Not impressed with this hotel for the cost. Everything was ""fine"" but the hotel is just so big that getting from one place to another takes forever. Highly recommend staying in the Palace tower as it has been refurbished our room was there and it was nice but family members stayed in other towers and were disappointed with the quality of the rooms especially for the cost. A couple strange things the room had a fridge but you couldn't use it and the pictures online of the room I rented had a couch and the actual room didn't have a couch. Gift shop was VERY overpriced ($20 for 3 waters) and the toilet paper was awful - Like I said it was 'ok' but for the price I would not stay here again."
50,Julia was extremely helpful and knowledgeable for us to feel comfortable during our trip. She explained all of the measures they are taking for Covid precautions. We are staying here for 2 days and feel completely safe and well taken care of - Vegas is slow but clean!
50,This was a special trip for the family since we were here to celebrate my sons birthday! When we arrived we were attended by Delano. He was very friendly kind helpful knowledgeable and we truly appreciated his hospitality. He‚Äôs been working for Caesars for over 18 years! (Very impressive!) I‚Äôm happy that we had a great interaction and would recommend looking for him if you need anything during your stay. He is fantastic! Look forward to coming back soon.
20,Well not the stay we were hoping for.    We were so excited to be staying at Caesar‚Äôs for the first time.    Check in was great and super friendly!    Got to the room. Loved it! Pool view high floor.    This is going to be great!    Until the morning when I went looking for towels. I opened the cupboard to find filthy towels jammed underneath! ü§¢    We called down stairs and asked for a supervisor. They said someone would come and take a look and bring us towels. Well they brought the towels (left them in a bag on the ground outside of our room) and we waited 2.5 hours for someone to come up.    I am disgusted disappointed and shocked at the lack of customer service.    No one ever came up to our room. We went to the front desk and showed them the pictures. A supervisor gave us an apology and $50 food credit and a room upgrade.    We went to breakfast and the more we talked the more disappointed we became. Cleanliness is supposed to be at its peak!    So we went back to the front desk and waited 45 minutes in line. Spoke to a different supervisor and she gave us a resort credit for just the one night and tried to make excuses.    I‚Äôm disappointed in the lack of concern from the supervisors during Covid.    The room upgrade was a joke. We got another bathroom in our room. Really!? The food credit could only be used at a handful of restaurants because most were closed. We ended up getting over priced Chinese at their noodle place. For 2 entrees and rice we still had to pay $48 out of pocket! What a waste.
50,Trip and stay have been the greatest hotel is very clean and as well as our room better then expected. Staff have been very polite and on top of everything we‚Äôve asked. Casino has also been very tightly kept
50,We had a great experience at Caesar‚Äôs parlance. Registration desk was busy considering all the Covid precautions being taken. Hugo the person assisting at the diamond desk counter was efficient friendly and even got us a room before check in time. Thanks Hugo.
10,Emailed my wife about 4 free nights $100 freeplay for slots and $50 for food. The free nights cost $51 per night for resort fee. Had to spend 3 hours with the Member Card and Casino Host to get the Freeplay and Food comps. Then when we checked out we had to spend more time because they still did not show the food comps and were charging us for $32 food.    Not to mention the room came with no soap or shampoo too.
10,"We totally regret staying here as there's poor management and supervisory staff. There are many reasons why:  1. For 5 hours we dealt with NO HOT WATER to NO WATER supply at all and spoke to 6 people finally went down the front desk and spoke to Miguel the mgr whose first words were ""we had an emergency what can we do?""  The right thing to do is to at least pffer room change but hes willing to do that but downgrading us from suite to standard room. When the water finally started there were just green stuff coming out... yuk. Pics taken.  2. At the gym they forced me to wear facial masks even when i was running in the treadmill. I spoke to Frank the guest service supervisor who was very argumentative on the phone. He would not take any explanation and adamantly violating the CDC guidelines. Basically he said you're in our property! Perfect response!!!  3. The first room i checked in was filthy and was not cleaned and they had fridge upon request on website but did not have any.    Dont stay here theres more nice hotels with great customer service."
40,We couldn't have enjoyed the pool area more. Staff was amazing rented day beds & had a blast. Our room was in the Octavious Tower & was in need of renovation which surprised be as it was not the cheapest room there more middle of price range. Thought it would be nicer. Vanity in bathroom was falling apart & really banged up. Housekeeping also missed that someone had stuck a USED bandaid on the front had to call to have it removed. Desk/dresser in living area was the same. TV was off center from the whole console not at all the kind of caliber I expected at Ceasars. Finally we arrived early & although the hotel was very empty due to the Covid pandemic they still were going to charge us $50 to check in early. You'd think at this time Ceasars would be treating their guests like royalty...not so.
30,We went to Caesars Palace For the first time with high expectation but we couldn‚Äôt be more wrong even when they promise you to have A clean And disinfected room not true at all. Our our bathroom was disgusting hairs everywhere and a shower wasn‚Äôt draining that can tell you the shower Wasn‚Äôt even clean. I ask in the front desk for an upgrade and they give me this room saying the I will have premium room with a premium view.I only have the view....
50,I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of check-in and check out during COVID. The property was much nicer than I expected after reading some reviews from others. We were upgraded at the kiosk to the Augustus tower and the room was beautiful. I would stay here again. The location is perfect for going anywhere on the strip.
50,My wife and I decided to take a last minute trip to vegas. Long story short we had a terrible experience getting there and got in much much later than expected. There was a line but it moved fairly quick. We we're feeling pretty down and had last the desire to party. But we'd already paid so we we're just going to enjoy the hotel and call it a night.    When we got to the counter Xavier M. greeted us with a warm genuine greeting and instantly began defusing our apparent frustration. His small talk was on point and his suggestions of chill things to do nearby were very much appreciated. He made us feel like the only guests that night despite how busy they were. We ended up staying out all night and having a wonderful time. Had we gotten someone else I don't think it would have gone the same way. Thanks for your hospitality and genuine interest in the customer experience. You treated us like people and recognized our exhaustion. Instead of shutting down you helped us smile. THANK YOU
40,I was greeted by a front desk team member Shelby who was very pleasant knowledgeable and informative during my check in. She explained to me how to redeem my offer and my privileges as a Diamond Plus card member. Additional they fulfilled my request for a small fridge. I highly recommend becoming a Diamond member because there are a lot of perks that regular guests do not get to enjoy.
20,We were upset with facilities at Caesar's no restaurants open no buffets open and no entertainment open. We understand Covid had an impact but eating overpriced Chinese out of a bag in our room for dinner was not the experience we were looking for. The hotel didn't even have any concierge service to ask questions. If Caesar's had informed guests services were limited to gambling and drinks only prior to our booking we would have never gone there in the first place.
50,Stayed at Caesar's Palace July 12-17 of 2020. We had a great time! They made everyone feel safe and even had a seal on the room that it was sanitized. A new idea was that once I went to the room then nobody else would ever enter it. If you needed anything then they would come to the door but not enter the room. Caesar's is always great and this time was no exception. I stayed in Room 4363 in the Augustus Tower. Had a great view facing north of the strip. My friend stayed across the hall in 4366 and had a great view of the fountains and the strip to the south. Wonderful trip and already have plans for a January visit. Be forewarned! I was well over 100 degrees everyday and 3 days were over 110. Still fun and had a great time!
50,Wow! Immediately upon arrival I was greeted by friendly security for temperature checks and followed with service from an amazing employee named Delano! His beautiful energy stuck with my friend and I the entire night. Since this was my first time staying at Caesars I didn‚Äôt know what to expect but WOW! The pool view the clean rooms and the wonderful staff members. I will always choose this hotel!
50,I just needed a break from doing nothing! Staying at Caesar‚Äôs Palace using Caesar‚Äôs Reward points was amazing! Great room Pool was awesome and the service industry staff everywhere I went was so friendlyThank you! Also Ivy my concierge by text-was a real advantage!
20,Caesar offer me resort credit for food .  I spent in Paris LV restaurant but they did not accept it when I check out.  I speak to the front desk and the host but they are not friendly to answer my questions .
20,The entire stay was awful overcrowded. The hassle to get decent service drag our bags around then to get to our room and find it wasn't in the location i had asked for. The fire alarm went off all night.
30,Furniture in the rooms didn‚Äôt seem to be well taken care of. Nicks all over the dresser and the sink had some sore if black stuff that came up into the sink. Even the elevators were not that well kept up. The wood was chipped and the hand rail was broken and hanging off. The shower leak water into the outside floor shower. There appeared to be a TV in the mirror but that didn‚Äôt work. The buttons to move the blinds didn‚Äôt work. Must of which I would consider luxury items but given the price I would expect this.
20,We are here for a week and so far the first two days haven‚Äôt been great. Our hotel room had a leak from the room above us and we didn‚Äôt get moved to a new room or an upgrade but instead we got to spend my husbands birthday waiting for someone to come fix it. If you want to use the pools you need a day bed which only provides access for 4. We have a group of 6 which would require two day beds. Also no fridge for storing food or beverages. Was hoping they could clear the mini fridge so we can use it but the will not. Overall not a good experience at all.
30,Whilst I often get lost in Caesar's which has a very confused layout due to so many expansions since it was originally built I like this property for the shopping location food court options and general ambience. The forum shops are always absolutely beautiful with the indoor sky etc... I like the history of the place too i.e. the fact that it has continued since it was built in the 60s. All in all a place that I always ensure to visit when in Vegas.
10,Stayed in Ceasers Palace February and August of 2020 and both times Ceasers has had terrible service from beginning to end. Both times the representative at check-in were rude and seemed very unhappy to be there. On my most recent August trip I stayed 6 nights 7 days and I was unable to get house keeping I was informed it was not an option due to covid-19. Imagine not having any house keeping for your long stay NOT to say I am messy but it is nice to come back to a tidy room we pay resort fees. I had family staying at ARIA Bellagio and MGM Grand who received house keeping and great service. I would not recommend anyone to stay with ceasers palace but I will let you be the judge if you choose to stay. I expected great service from a hotel and casino who is the face of a company.
50,First time in Vegas and ceasers palace made it a amazing experiance . cafe Americano was amazing and it being downstairs on the way to our room was convenient instead of walking all the way to the food court . forum shops are flawless and just a great experience
50,We had a ball even with limited access to certain areas. The Palace is a great place to visit whether you are guest (which I highly recommend)  or just stopping by for the day. Not only is the Casino top notch but the mall and the restaurants are amazing as well. My wife's favorite part of our stay was relaxing in the pool sipping on frozen drinks.
20,I paid 50$ for a room upgrade since it was my birthday weekend. Our room ac barely worked and was so hot we couldn‚Äôt sleep. Got a new room and had the same issue. We didn‚Äôt even stay the full weekend. Left early! I got to pay 150$ to have the worst hotel room available!
50,This is a great place to stay. Friendly helpful and just an overall great atmosphere. The rooms are great and well maintained. Clean and comfortable. Could not have asked for more. Big place with lots to do and see along with the gambling. Never a dull moment.
20,Took 2 hours to check in because they had 2 people working the front desk registration. It was 120 degrees outside & the A/C hardly worked. The jacuzzi tubs hand held sprayer did not work. And to top it off I get home & view my bill the following weekend and extra charges for snacks I did not touch or eat in the mini bar.
50,What can I say but thank you. ESPECIALLY Leallysa....you rock. My Birthday weekend and you nailed the room!!!! Will you marry me? Jk Thank you for what you did. Love you all @ Caesar's Properties for the hospitality and great service!!!
50,"My wife and I stayed at Caesars Palace in the Palace Tower. The room was immaculate. Very large. Great channels on the TV large bathroom comfy bed fast internet great pool very friendly staff. Great ""center"" Strip location. Great dining options at all price points. I will return."
50,Had a great time Caesars is reopening safely and responsibly. Very clean sanitary and well maintained. Great atmosphere great staff very friendly and very good food. Management is doing their best in a difficult situation imposed on them.
50,"Stayed in one of their more ""basic"" rooms for 2 nights and we loved it! Very big walk in shower and hot tub. There are several different fees they charge but its worth it to live the vegas experience!"
10,One of the worst stays in Vegas I‚Äôve ever had. My rooms were so dirty and nobody was willing to help me. I cannot believe that Caesar‚Äôs was the disgusting. I found a toenail in my room and nails on the floor. That is disgusting
20,Caesars was my favorite place to go..but not this trip. If you arrive early they will charge you 50.00 plus..what a ripoff. The room was not that clean and the hallways were dirty. The gambling was so-so. I think this casino is living on its old reputation. So SAD.
50,The staff was friendly and attentive. Special regards to COdy Andre and James at the Venus Pool. I was disappointed in the cleanliness of the Venus pool. I went to the main pool and it was a very clean pool. There was a lot of hair etc in the water at the venus pool and after pay for day beds for 5 of the 7 days I was hoping for a cleaner pool. It was almost as if the filter was not working. We did have a minor issue with our spa tub in the room where the water stopper would not disengage but the maintenance staff was awesome and fixed the situation.
20,We arrived at the resort by motorcycle and it was extremely hot and as soon as we walked in the door the staff started badgering us to put on masks. We were so hot and sweaty we just wanted to cool off and they would not leave us alone‚Ä¶ And we could not find any water because they had it shut off - blamed it on Covid. We went to check in but couldn‚Äôt get our room for a couple of hours so we decided to go have lunch. Nothing on the lunch menu was less than $25 for every item. Lunch -$80. Then we went to our rooms and wanted to go to the pool and it was so crowded we couldn‚Äôt get in due to a small limited number of people. We went and had dinner and then went back to go to the pool and found out it closed at 6:30 PM. We got up this morning to leave and there was a coffee maker but no coffee in the room. We called and again they blamed it on Covid. Don‚Äôt bother even going to Las Vegas right now‚Ä¶
50,what else can you say...it‚Äôs Caesar‚Äôs Palace...it‚Äôs alway Royal. your always right in the middle of Vegas just to say your staying at Caesars is cool! will always come back to the palace every time i‚Äôm in vegas
20,My wife and I like staying at Ceaser‚Äôs when we go to Vegas 2-3 times per year. We like the new rooms with the walk through shower in the palace tower. We have stayed several times in them. This was the 1st time we stayed here in the summer and it will be the last. When we checked in at the Diamond and 7 star counter it was quick and efficient with all the COVID restrictions our room was ready right away.    When we got to the room it was really hot in there but it was 112 outside at 4pm so the hot of the day we dropped our bags and set the AC for the lowest temp 65 and on the highest speed and went to gamble then dinner we figured it would be cold in there when we got back. We came back around 8pm and it was 77 on the thermostat but felt warmer in the main part of the room.    We called maintenance who showed up in less then 10 minutes and was on it. He opened the AC and checked it out he also positioned the air register so it faced the bed and set it to run without cycling on and off. He said there is only 1 Vent for the room and it was open all the way. We thought it would cool down but it didn‚Äôt it was hot in the room for the entire stay. Worst part was the bathroom there are no vents in there so with the door closed it was awful. Sweating each time we had to use it. We were told that with COVID there is no room switching so we toughed it out.    Several of the restaurants are closed and lots of the machines which I totally understand but that and the room being hot made for a tough trip. Ceaser‚Äôs has to know that they built a casino in the desert and that 1 vent in 700sq ft room isn‚Äôt going to cut it. For a place that is so spot on usually they failed on this one. Hate to say it but I‚Äôm switching over to the Cosmopolitan I‚Äôll pay the extra $25/ night not to have to take freezing shower in the middle of the night to stop sweating. There is no shortage of options in Vegas it‚Äôs to bad this used to be our spot.
20,First time staying at Caesars. I won‚Äôt stay there again. This hotel ‚Äútries‚Äù to be upscale but they were severely lacking in the service department. We waited for our room until after 6pm. There was no sense of urgency to correct the problem or to provide accommodations. We rented a cabana AND a had to rent an additional daybed at the pool since there were 8 of us. They wouldn‚Äôt throw in an umbrella unless we paid an additional $100 - really? If you‚Äôre spending 2k for a pool day with your friends then maybe? I just never felt like a hotel ‚Äúguest‚Äù but more like a nuisance to the employees that had to be there. This attitude was also displayed by the dealers and casino staff as they created a gambling environment that was uncomfortable and unwelcoming. I understand it‚Äôs covid but some of went to Las Vegas to unwind a bit while following safety guidelines. And..... why in Gods name where there sooooo many people driving around in the rascal carts full speed and honking? That‚Äôs safe? Someone needs to regulate on that. I‚Äôm sorry but I was looking forward to staying at Caesars because it is an older respected supposedly service-oriented hotel - not so much
20,Room was clean and adequate but too many things that would be considered basic service require a cost - including fridge use. The shower head fell and the bathroom door did not close. I may or may not go to Caesars again.
20,We stayed in the premium palace tower.  The view was horrible we got a room that it was all dark in the 5th floor my room was lacking maintenance. Live the ceasar‚Äôs palace but this wasn‚Äôt a good experience
30,Mini bar was almost empty with a half consumed soda in it when I checked in. Called front desk and they says it was supposed to be locked. Then locked it remotely. Ordered food delivery to my room through Ceasars app. Received a text saying they were unable to charge to my room and they cancelled the order. Then 11 minutes later they text saying it was being delivered. Room was sooo far from self parking. Like a mile. Casino was sooo packed. No social distancing. Paid for 2 nights left after night one. Will not stay again.
40,The only reason for the very good rate is the exceptional costumer service provided by Mr. Delano at the front desk . He was a true professional.  The lines are so long ( I know we don't have to forget the COVID-19 factor.  Check your bill carefully before you check out. There are very big chances you'll get charged for mini bar that you have never touched.
30,I have health problems and can't breathe with a mask. I do wear a shield that covers my whole face. Your security yelled and followed me around telling me I can't be here I or the security know of my health condition that I can not wear the type of mask she was telling me I have to wear.
50,Originally booked at the Linq but due to Covid we got moved to Caesar‚Äôs. With the wonderful help of Diana Turner Casino Host I was able to get a one bedroom suite! The room was amazing!    Huge walk-in shower with two shower heads and two massage Jets. An oversized tub including a tv in the bathroom. The bedroom was large and bed very comfortable. The best part was the full family room. We don‚Äôt spend a ton of time in the room but it was great to unwind and have a gathering point before going out.    Casino was fun and did have some loose slots as I hit a couple of big ones. The only think lacking was waitress service which was very slow compared to the Linq!    Restaurants amazing and of great variety. Even the food court held its own.    Pools lively clean and fun. Would go back for sure without masks for Covid.    Overall a great trip and special thanks to Diana Turner! We are returning in September and hope to either get the same suite or a Nobu suite!    Thank you for a special 50th!
50,Right in the middle of the step. Great walking distance to anywhere. Rooms are bit of a hike because they are so far from the casino. Several good and shopping options right there. Large hotel Not the place to stay if you are looking for quiet!
50,Leallysa was absolutely wonderful. She has a very nice personality and made me feel very comfortable despite the anxiety of visiting LV during the COVID 19 insanity. She was able to find an upgraded room for my wife and me. I cannot say enough about how positive my first interaction with the Caesars' staff was. Great representative for Caesars!
50,My favorite place to spend an anniversary. Karla at the front desk was accommodating and professional. The entire hotel was as clean as my home. The staff are happy and concerned about our safety. Get here and you will be thrilled the way you are treated. You feel like Caesar and Cleopatra.
40,My husband and I just returned early from a trip to Las Vegas. Be forewarned it is NOT the Vegas you know and love. It is very different. Will start with checkin. Rae was f as fantastic. Room was great. However no housekeeping services during the stay. Temperature checks masks increased security. Overall good job. Restaurants great food and service. Bobby Flay mesa grill still very good. Had to have food in order to sit in montecristo cigar bar. Everything seems to be extra expensive. Breakfast was $70. The not do good aspects all bars closed. Very very difficult to get a drink. Had to sit in a restaurant or at a machine and wait LONG periods of time before anyone came by. Not all machines were every other one off just removed chairs. Totally didn‚Äôt work because two times people just sat down right next to me. The biggest issue is the pool. We didn‚Äôt even try to go. Join a queue by texting... young people in their 20‚Äôs lined up no social distancing and crowds so many it was hard to get to our bank of elevators all day during the pool being open. Drunk people being wheeled out of the pool area. What they have done is clear...open a hotel with lots of capacity. Lower room rates and now those that would normally go to Drais beach club or Planet Hollywood are now at Caesars. No thank you!!! Not to mention the slots are TIGHT. We left two days early and won‚Äôt return until restrictions are lifted.
10,The sink was clogged and very dirty. It was draining so slowly leaving the dirty foam in the sink bowl so gross. There were thick dust on the top of the TV cabinet as the room had not been cleaned for a long time. Though it wasn‚Äôt visible the rest of the room was probably just as dusty. Very disappointed with Caesars!
20,"Let's begin with how the Resort is beautiful has friendly staff and great activities. However our stay was not the best one! We checked inn in room 1251 Julius Tower. Everything went well the first two days; the third day someone broke into our room and stole around $2000 worth of items. While we were out and about walking Las Vegas Blvd. this person force itself into our room cracking the door and leaving behind a few broken items from the peep hole. We reported it to the hotel spoke to Michelle (the manager) and Bruce (security) mentioned everything and what they stole. We asked to see cameras but unfortunately the Julius Tower does not have any cameras in the hallways or elevator. The hotels excuse is ""it is an old tower."" We also reported it the police and now we are suppose to wait 3-5 business days for the investigation to be finalized by the hotel. Yes we were put in the palace tower after that incident for one more night but that doesn't change the fact that we had an invasion of privacy we were exposed to the person who came in our room whom might have COVID stole our belongings and the hotel does not have enough security. My advice for such a well top resort put cameras EVERYWHERE give access to only employees and checked in guests to use the elevators to go up to their rooms and have security do rounds. Tomorrow August 12 2020 makes it the third day of the investigation and Friday August 14 2020 being the 5th. We will contact the resort and follow up with our situation. I will do updates based on how the resort handles our issue. Until then I advice you to not stay in the Julius Tower for your safety."
30,Vagas local my girlfriend and I had a little staycation over the weekend and we booked the Octavius Premium Room | 1 King | Non-Smoking. Sadly the room smelt like a smoker had lived in it. Once we opened the door it smelt like we were walking into a cigar bar. Called the front desk and best they could do was to spray air freshener. Overall the room was beautiful. 5 stars for the room -2 for the smell.
10,DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL! WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.It was my first time to stay in Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. I have stayed at hotels in Vegas before however someone had recommended my sister this hotel plus there was great ratings. I was so excited to come and check in since it looked so nice! It was also my birthday so we were looking forward to a great time. We come to find the hotel was just a disappointment. We initially booked the Octavius room but as we arrived we upgraded our room to the Augustus Collection for the strip view. We checked in and went out to eat. Later on we came back at night to change our clothes and check out our view to see what it would look like being super excited and all. We come to find we are put near the end of the strip view (near the highway) and there are no lights at all. The view was horrible! We go down to the customer service desk waited in line and tell them about the situation which an employee switched us to another room to what he thought was an amazing view. Keep in mind this was around 2am-3am. We get the new room card and check out the room before moving our luggage. The view was not as expected and it was still dark out. We then waited in line AGAIN to speak to the same employee which we were sad about the horrible strip view which the hotel concluded more than likely the lights weren't on because of Covid 19. We were understanding and downgraded our room to what we had initially had the Octavius room. We had to move our luggage again and as we put our stuff down. We saw that there was still a bit of trash in the trash bin which was a little weird but we didn't really want to think too much into it. We then started getting ready to sleep (shower brush our teeth etc.) Then as we opened up the sheets there was red marks that looked like blood and there was a hair too. My sister also ordered an extra sheet and we saw there was a big yellow stain on it. At this point we are furious and went down AGAIN to the customer service desk and after discussing our options on what to do they switched us to another room giving us a Augustus Strip View (which we did not care much for). This was around 4am-5am and we were tired and fed up. We checked in the new room and there was dust and some 3-4 black dots on our sheets. At this point we were too tired and just slept. I hated staying at this hotel. Mainly because of the cleaning. I know things have changed since Covid 19 but isn't the hotel suppose to focus on cleanliness. Plus on top of that the manager that night named Miguel Quintanilla did not come out to talk to us but kept sending the employee in and out. I would say about 4 times. I felt bad for the guy. We were furious. The manager did kick off 2 nights worth of the resort fee on our bill. However we will not be staying here again or recommending anyone here. Comparing Park MGM and Mandalay Bay we have experience way better. This was the worst birthday and Vegas hotel I have experienced.
50,We were staying at Harrah's across the street but ended up coming to Caesars so we could gamble (and actually get served drinks) and to eat and shop. Our experience here was great! I would go back again in a heartbeat.
10,Been to Vegas many times and this was worst hotel experience. Paper thin walls where your neighbor sounds like they are in your room and their tv is your tv. Also right now extreme mask enforcement even at their pool which it took a miracle to get into. Very sad to see Vegas in such a state. Stay home and don‚Äôt waste your money until this mask craziness ends. Vegas not so fabulous now.
20,After selecting this property for its old town feel and new town revival we were extremely disappointed. As the property is historically beautiful the rules and unwritten make this COVID unfriendly paradise into a honeymoon hell. Where to start ... the food is subpar and expensive; if you can find a place to eat that is. Making your way through a maze of drab emptiness of mask signs and mask police ... stopping to confront you as you sip coffee without a mask. Even the shops/mall have signs not to sit on the benches; they don‚Äôt want to clean them? You can find a muffin or overpriced croissant for brunch just to wander aimlessly around vacant bars to find a spot to eat your food on the go. The staff is professional but unfriendly; never giving you the benefit of the doubt that you are obeying mask rules but just want to sip your drink or eat your food. Natzi like Security flocks to you as if you just committed a crime if you pull your mask off to take a bite or sip. They don‚Äôt tell you about the pool ... the main draw for us. A beautiful ‚ÄúGarden Oasis‚Äù turned into a first come first served malay! Texting to wait 6hrs to get to a peasant pool at your own hotel just to enjoy 45min in the sun. Don‚Äôt go far for that 6hrs ... they want you to hunker in your room or blow through cash on the casino floor as you wait for eternity just to get to an oasis; normality turned into a privilege! You find out after your 6hr wait that if you really want some pool time that you could have coughed up $60-$400 for a nicer lounge chair or cabana ... well worth it if you are on your honeymoon. Once you get to freedom expect tan lines! Must wear a mask at all times even outside on pool deck during blistering peak sun. No professional hints but feet in the water count as in the pool. Screw this place/property during the pandemic. Super unreasonable requests just to have fun. Making the most of it but Caesars left a bad taste in our mouths.
10,Do not stay at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas!!!!‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå  To make a long story short our room was broken into during our 4hours spent at this hotel. Every time I relive rehear and remember our stay I am bombarded by horrible memories and thoughts of our traumatic experience. This hotel takes no responsibility for any of our items stolen even though:  1.) There was no room in the safe for our items  2.) There are absolutely ZERO cameras in the areas where guests stay  3.) Our room was dirty when we got there  4.) A lock analysis shows that somebody tried to get into our room by forced entry but was not successful (so how did they get out with our items????)  5.) Our neighboring room was unrented we‚Äôve asked 4 different times for a lock analysis but nobody will tell us the results  6.) We were told by the Las Vegas Metro police that this is something that happens all the time and that they‚Äôve told this establishment that security needs to be increased...SO THE HOTEL KNOWS THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM!!!!    How within 5 minutes of us leaving this hotel (we left at 8:47 and the thief left at 8:53 according to our lock analysis) someone was able to get into our room and get out with our items??? and how is this not Caesar‚Äôs Palace fault????    Not only did this traumatic experience happen but the manager had the audacity to offer a solution of 1/2 off for the night...for a room we spent 4 hours in.    EDIT: They also will not release the lock analysis for the room we rented or the room next to us to show real proof of their findings and they can‚Äôt keep their story/findings straight. They are covering up inside burglaries and blaming it as a ‚Äúthird party‚Äù. If this was a third party job I would like to see the proof. If they can prove that it is a third party then we could accept that. With no real proof it cannot be shown that this was not an inside job.    Not posting thos for attention or to try to get anything out of Caesars Palace. I just want to make my friends and family aware and would like at some point for this hotel (which we‚Äôve been in contact with since June 8th) to take some sort of responsibility for its lack of security.
40,Need more roulette machines. There is only one designated area for roulette machines and people are always waiting for a space to be available. It‚Äôs a popular game. Need to add more machines so more people can play and not wait hours.
50,Team Member Hugo displayed excellent & efficient customer service in the 7 star/Diamond registration lounge. I definitely will make future recommendations to my family & friends to stay at the ceasars palace las vegas!
50,I visited the Players Club desk to get another players card. Christine helped me. First she explained my level and how to go higher. She explained about specials on Mon and Tue for locals. She made sure that I have a Caesars credit card. What a nice young lady. Made me feel like a big shot with such great service. Great job Christine! Thank you
10,The absolute worst. I can't believe I signed up for their rewards program. May the billionaire owners check their management. We booked Caesars after a great trip to Zion and Bryce just for the gambling and the pools for our kids. We checked in at at 5 pools close at at 6. Check out at 11 pools open at 10. And they dont tell you on their website or in person that you need to make a reservation for the pool during the short hours. But you can pay $350 for a cabana. We never got to use the pools.    Walked a 1/2 mile to check into a long slow line. No snacks in the fridge but if you use it for personal snacks it's $75. A Dog costs $85 a night but the poddy spot (another 1/2 mile) is less than the size of a mini closet. Can't afford a dog run at $85/ night per guest? Dog owners gamble too. Never again for convention or personal use. I will share that with everyone in my business and friendship circle.
30,I understand this is a strange time to be traveling and I‚Äôve certainly taken that into account. I‚Äôve actually stayed at similar class hotels over the last 2 months so I am familiar with new ‚Äúnorms.‚Äù    Second time at CP last was 2 years ago in the Forum tower and this time in Octavius. I was happy to get a discount when booking for being an NP and they do so for other frontline workers which is nice. I‚Äôve been working like crazy over the last few months so it was much appreciated.    As others have noted there seemed to be a lot of packed rooms with ‚Äúpartiers‚Äù all hours of the night. I noticed as I was walking to get ice in the middle of the night. Thankfully I couldn‚Äôt hear them from my room but I could imagine if they had a neighbor it would be extremely unpleasant with constant entering and exiting the rooms and loud music. Just unexpected for CP.    They do seem to nickel and dime for everything. Early check in was $50. This was even though front desk admitted they had ‚Äúplenty of rooms available‚Äù at 130 p on a Wednesday when I arrived to check in. I paid it because my kids were tired from flying but it just seems chintzy on their part for charging. Checking out late was $30-$60 depending on how late which I understand. I stayed at a Ritz last week and arrived at 11 and was allowed to check in without a fee so this was noted. I also have checked in early at previous LV resorts without the added fee.    Resort fees. Yes they‚Äôre high but like others have noted Pool was usually at capacity and extras like fridge coffee maker room service etc were not even available to use. It‚Äôs whatever though and I understand things are different now. Perhaps they (and others) should consider adjusting those fees until they are able to offer the services expected.    The Pool. It‚Äôs gorgeous. Everything is beautiful. I didn‚Äôt note any of the ‚Äútrash and litter‚Äù others have complained about. It was pristine and we were very happy to go. With that being said had I not rented a cabana for $300 to allow us to have pool day we probably would have been out of luck. The waiting list was maxed out at 10a on Saturday and similarly on Friday.    Yes masks are required even when lounging poolside and I understand the rules. I took mine off for a minute cool off in my own cabana (literally 30 ft away from anyone) and was promptly yelled at to put it back on.  I‚Äôm a healthcare worker I know how important masks are but if I‚Äôm lounging in my own cabana which is essentially like my own room it seems a bit silly. They are not required in the pool (where everyone is crammed together) so it seems a bit counterintuitive. Rules are rules though so I obliged. This was the first hotel I‚Äôve stayed at where they were required in a lounge chair so must be specific to the area.    Weed smell everywhere!  I‚Äôm only 35 and personally I don‚Äôt have a problem with marijuana use. I was just a little bit surprised to smell it literally everywhere! In the parking lot in the hallway at the pool it was just everywhere.    All in all the CP is still a beautiful property.  They can‚Äôt control Covid and I understand this.  I do think that I would choose to stay elsewhere next time I visit though as CP didn‚Äôt really go above or beyond to entice me back.
50,Hi staying here over this weekend 8/7-8/10. Just wanted to give a quick shout out to Jay at the Diamond/7 Star registration! My husband checked in with him yesterday and couldn't stop talking about how helpful Jay was. Thank you! You obviously enjoy your work and take pride in giving your guests the best experience and value!!!
10,My check out bill was all screwed!! Do not stay there!!!! Management is very arrogant and doesn‚Äôt care about customers. A few dealers are friendly but many of them just deal and no interaction at all!!
20,We stayed in early august for a night after staying at Aria and Cosmo on the same week. I been coming to Caesars properties for over 20 years and have never been charged an early check in fee. This time it was mandatory even being 2 hours before standard check in time. The pool was about 70% reserved for day beds and hardly any regular chairs. We stayed in the Octavious rooms and there were crazy parties in every room close to us till 3am and hotel staff didn‚Äôt bother to say anything after complaints. After this stay I will never stay at Caesars again. It‚Äôs Aria for me from now on. So much better experience and didn‚Äôt nickle and dime us for everything ether. No early check in fee pool had tons of seating just so much better.
30,"Spent a few nights @ CP. All was good except for a couple of security losers. Walking from the Nobu to the main area I was almost run over by two scooters - one driven by a teen (15-16 YO) and an adult who allowed his 6YO son to drive. Ten feet later the 6Yo crashed into the teen. There were two guards who witnessed this situation. Their response was to yell at me to put my mask up. BTW I was eating a sandwich that was purchased in Caesars which according to your own website I was allowed to do. They said nothing to the ""cowboys"" in fact they thought it was funny. This will be my last visit to CP."
10,"I don't appreciate having a cum stained couch in the overpriced suite. They then wouldn't even move our room. We were also charged a ""resort fee"" for amenities that were unavailable (pool sauna and gym). Also I use insulin and the refrigerator was taken out of the room so there was nowhere for me to store the insulin. The bed was very hard and the pillows smelled like they hadn't been changed in months. For almost $300 a night I should have stayed at motel 6 it would have been nicer and we would have had more money to gamble. Top to it off (I realize this is Vegas but...) the lowest minimum bet blackjack table was $50!! it was that or video blackjack. Will never stay here again"
10,My wife and I stayed at Ceasars Palace from July 30th thru Aug 3rd. Awful experience... we are Diamond Club members and have been going to Ceasars for the past 10 years and we were shocked to see how bad the Casino is now. Pool area was filthy with trash everywhere all day.. interior and exterior falling apart and the grounds in front just filthy with trash and stains in the concrete. Our room was dirty and the AC didn‚Äôt work so they had to switch us to a different room. Dealers were yelling at customers to get away from the tables and my wife could not even stand 10 feet away from a table to watch me play roulette. My advice: Do Not go to Ceasars Palace... we ended up going to The Bellagio and gambling and spending the day and Cosmopolitan... both of those casinos were clean and friendly. Ceasars has gone downhill and their Mgmt does not care anymore. So sad because that used to be the best casino in Vegas.
50,We absolutely loved our stay at Caesars Palace made particularly special by Maria who checked us in at the front desk. Our room was sparkling clean with a view of the pool and city lights. The hotel is centrally located which made is perfect for our one night stay. Unfortunately we didn't have time to use the pool!
20,Caesar‚Äôs Palace is a legendary icon of Vegas. From movies to the thoughts of out of this world service. I wish this was the reality. The Forum tower should be demolished and rebuilt. The horror starts with the elevators which are cold and uninviting needing lights and repairs. Popping off on the ‚Äú65th‚Äù floor the stench of cannabis fills your nostrils. Entering the room it‚Äôs tired and in desperate need of a makeover. The furniture is scuffed the bed sheets have snags the carpet is bubbling.    Oh cool this room has old tech in it not one USB port but a CD player and a TV built into the bathroom mirror the drapes are motorized however only one side works.    The bathroom area is decent with a giant shower however it took almost 5 minutes for the water to get hot.    Overall I don‚Äôt recommend this place. I think the room at the Luxor is very comparable at less than half the price.    Oh and let‚Äôs not get started on the ridiculous ‚Äúresort fee‚Äù. Everything is closed due to COVID....
10,Worst customer service. Asked front desk to waive resort fees because we came for the pool and there was a 6 hour wait (literally) so never got to go out there. Front desk manager explained that the pool was not part of the resort fees but didn‚Äôt offer anything else to compensate for the bad experience. I then asked him to have it comped based on my play in the casino which should have more than qualified but the manager said that they were the hotel and the casino was a separate department and the casino was separate so I would have to speak to a host. In other words after waiting 20 minutes in line I had to wait in another line to speak to a host (manager refused to call one over the phone). Basically customer service is non-existent at Caesars.
40,Check in was over 1 hour and parking to registration is 20 minute walk. Things that were great: everything was medium. I would probably stay again to experience the pool area. Food court is really slow.
50,Ceasars Place is a phenomenal escape where I am able to relax refresh and at home. The staff is the best in the universe and all are warm and friendly they are of Divine creation and deliver all my expectations every time. The anticipate my wants and needs with the attentive care that is the standard for all Hotels and Casino should aspire to achieve and will do moving forward.    The facilities are spectacular and the attention to details cleanliness selection and design are all astonishing and unique. They have absolutely everything and they deliver rewards and winning unlike any other. That is why I consider this my home and they ensure this happens every time.  Q  I also want to personally bless and give thanks all the staff for taking care of me and handling all my request with precision follow up and follow through that leaves me filled will love peace and happiness that is required of all creation. This is because I provide the detailed directions they need to handle everything when required.    A special note and I want to extend my eternal gratitude to Clarae. She has a unique ability to provide the oversight each and everytime I‚Äôm there. From Arrival to Departure she always displays the true care and concern that I require. I know that she is filled with the Light of God and I will always reach out to Clarae for eternity. Thank you Clarae for being there listening and taken care of me. You are amazing and wonderful so please continue to share the Divine light with everyone you come in contact with. It is clear to see you sit high in the kingdom of Heaven and you are always there by God‚Äôs side!    Special mentions: Lisa Rewards VIP Keli VIp check-in Margarie Cocktail Host Palamena Cocktail Host from Bulgaria many cocktail host were great the cleaning staff in-room and especially the ones on casino floor Yvonne Martin Craps Table Host Will Steakhouse Guide & Host of the perfect dinning experience! The reception staff at Kiosk absolutely amazing and the Security At Lost & Found (ONLY) wow talk about protectors of humanity! God bless you all and thank you! üôèüèø‚ù§Ô∏è‚≠êÔ∏è    Sour Note: Mike VIP host. I went from god to Diamond Elite in 7 days and the treatment I got from this host is deplorable. I regret to say this honestly but Mike often would lie about stuff he did or took care of but they were never done and there were daily inconveniences that effected me. He often refused to do his job and inform me to handle it myself and then ignore me. He said finally he was not my host anymore and I ask him to help me contact a new host and even that was refused by Mike VIP host Flamingo
10,Brutally overpriced for what you get. Check in line is atrociously long. Rooms outdated furniture beat up bed only somewhat comfortable. Cleaning is hit or miss virtually no service as far as I could tell. You could literally stay anywhere else on the strip and probably do better. This place has fallen hard.
20,"Interrupted sleep due to loud room right next to ours. Entire Palace tower was too hot and air conditioner in room was not working well. Pool was unavailable due to ""capacity"" being maxed out and would not compensate in price even though we could not utilize all of the facilities that the payments go towards. It was over 100 degrees and masks were required even sitting out of the pool in the chairs. We were WAY over charged for two drinks during the little time we actually got to be at the pool at the cost of 49.00 for the two!!! Our non smoking floor was consumed with the smell of weed so clearly it was not a non smoking floor. The staff was more concerned with the wearing of masks over your nose then smoking on floors and keeping the hotel temperature regulated. We will never be back to Ceaser's Palace or any of their properties."
10,Booked Palace view received interstate view with an adjoining room. Youngsters next door partied 2am-5am every night. Only one pool at limited capacity available (the reason we chose Caesars was for the pool experience) unless you spend an additional $500 per day for a daybed or cabana. Out of 4 days were able to spend 2 hours at a single pool and the mask policy is completely ridiculous. Entire property reeked of pot smoke even entire floor in Palace tower. Only casino visited where we didn't win a single dollar even though spending the most (5x as much) there. Will never again stay at a Caesar's Property (Bally's Paris ANY of them).
10,I visited this hotel with my family and it was one terrible experience after the other. The cards keys for the room incorrectly provided for a different room. After 30 minutes of finding out their mistake. The Room WIFI connection was broken. No WIFi in the room. The phone handheld without batteries to call the receptionist or front desk that they do not wish to take your call. Finally bottom line huge smell at canavis in the room. Terrible hotel.
20,You are nicked and dined for everything. The resort fees are ridiculous and for stuff you don't need. Who makes free local calls on a hotel phone any more? Nice room but not for a $50/night fee plus room rate.
20,The staff are less than friendly-communication from staff is non-existent. Woke up to start checkout today find they had charged me 300 from the minibar-which Was locked my entire stay. When I called to have it removed was told-I must‚Äôve taken something out or moved it. Watch out they‚Äôll try to get you too!    We stayed mon-fri . When I got to the pool Fri found out I had to text to even get in. Would‚Äôve been nice to know .
20,"Please Put your reading caps and glasses on this is going to be a long review! I arrived at the Caesars for my birthday Sunday July 26th 2020. i am a rewards member and utilized my comp room offer.  when i arrived at the front desk Ella did a wonderful job at up selling me.  I upgraded from a single king to the penthouse suite in the Octavius tower with the connecting double queen room.  The room even with the discount was very expensive which caused my expectations to be very high.  COVID 19 Alert. They have a red sticker on the door (6861) promising that the rooms are  clean and fully sanitized.  People they are misleading you. There were  tobacco and marijuana containers left from the previous occupants which tells me that if these were overlooked when the room was being cleaned  its not fully sanitized? After discovering that I walked into the master bedroom only to find a trash can with molded pizza in the window area. You have to question the integrity of  the staff and their enforcement of COVID 19 regulations and overall cleanliness.  As soon as the mold was discovered we went down to the desk to let the staff know what we found.  After a long 20 minute wait The hotel guest services manager Sarah D' Ambrosia came out in an attempt to handle this issue.  Sarah offered to upgrade our room to something she thought was better because it had a spa in it.  This was actually a down grade for us because we had a large group and needed the space that the non sanitized  penthouse suite offered.  After another 20 min of going back and forth with her she told us our best option was the go back into the dirty room clean the room ourselves and she would give me $100 off the room.   We insisted that she have to room properly sanitized while we wait but she said that would not be possible. I asked to speak with someone else in charge and she insisted that their was no one.  My only option was to take a downgrade or go into a dirty room.  At this point i was livid Why would a manager let us go back into a dirty room especially with COVID 19 in effect? Caesars has no regard for the health and safety of its occupants.  I also found several things throughout the suite that were not working such as the automatic curtains some of the shower knobs were falling off and we had to call a technician  to come out to reset the entire TV system through out the suite.  These things may be minor in nature but this room is $1300 a night and should be flawless.  The last problem that i encountered was the worst one for me because i felt like i was prejudged based on the color of my skin.       Tuesday morning we were locked out of the double queen portion of the suite which lead us back down stairs to wait in line for 30 min this time.  The  Hotel Operations Manager Nathan Byers was brought out to speak with me  he was very aggressive and rude with me form the start.  He asked me what was going on and i explained the situation to him  he looked in the computer and said that we did not pay for the conjoining room. Nathans attitude  was very condescending  he told us ""  when the suite was cleaned they left the door to the conjoining room open   and that's how we got into that portion of the suite.""  I was totally embarrassed and hurt he was essentially accusing me of stealing in front of his staff and many guests that were checking in.  I believe my complication had everything to do with the way Nathan Byers treated me.  At the end of the day he made us new keys but the damage was done because i was humiliated!  I honestly wouldn't recommend this hotel for any melanated people.  I have plenty of pictures and videos that i can post to validate my experience  i was treated like an animal and i hope that this review can affect real change"
50,Check in was easy! Veronica was so nice and we had a nice chat with her and she upgraded us to a pool view and the room was amazing! Kudos to Veronica and the housekeeping team for preparing a spotless room!
20,We had this trip planned well before the onset of Covid19 and had to move it twice. We finally set it for the last week of July. This was to celebrate one of my children‚Äôs 21st birthday. So we decided to stay at Caesars Palace.    The outside is nice and massive and sits mid strip. We rented 3 rooms in the Octavius Tower since we were told by the hotel these were the most recently renovated.    Check in was fairly quick people we wearing masks and complying and social distancing. There was a temperature check at check in.    The rooms were OK but pretty dated to be honest especially since they had been updated. It didn‚Äôt look very well maintained. The cabinets were worn the light switches did not operate any of the lights in the room you had to operate each from the light itself which is like any other lamp is normal but it would have been nice when the room was renovated it was updated. Also there are no USB charging ports by the nightstands or tables just on the desk and it only has one and is opposite of the seating area or bed.    Also there is no housekeeping because of covid but the room wasn‚Äôt as clean as I thought it should be. There were spots all over the bathroom floor looking like it hadn‚Äôt been mopped in quite sometime. There were not enough towels toilet paper or tissues in the room for our stay. We had to call to get them. I would have thought they would have had those items stocked when we arrived however when called they arrived quickly. One other thing I noticed is that the AC vent was pretty dirty and didn‚Äôt looked like it had been cleaned for awhile either.    Front desk wasn‚Äôt very pleasant or helpful when asked about activities restaurants etc. They didn‚Äôt seem to care.    The resort fee was very overpriced since the WIFI was terrible and couldn‚Äôt connect the fitness center and pool was reduced capacity time service. Even in these difficult times they were unwilling to waive the fees.    The food court only had three places open out 6 or 7 and several other restaurants closed. The shops closed early everyday by 5-7 pm everyday so that was weird.    For the places that were open they were still quite expensive.    The dealers were friendly and by Friday things were picking up.    The pool was nice but operating at reduced capacity and hours.    Overall it was OK but my party preferred the Venetian more so when we return againmost likely that is where we will stay next time.    I gave a 2 out of 5 because of quality value and service. Too expensive for the service quality of the property and outdated.    Certainly not the Caesars of the past and not on the same level as the Wynn and Encore.
40,My husband and I have a wonderful time at Caesar‚Äôs for a much-needed getaway during this pandemic. Temperature checks and mask mandate were appreciated by us. I didn‚Äôt expect to need to wear my mask outside by the pool but they will require you until you are physically in the water waist-high. Tiare was a wonderful host at Neptune pool. Many restaurants operating with with limited menus but overall the staff at Caesar‚Äôs and restaurants were happy to be back to work. Vanderpump‚Äôs was the only disappointment due to their requirement to put your mask back on in between sips of your drink. Otherwise fantastic trip and experience!
30,I was disappointed in the cleanliness of the room. There was hair on the floor in the bathrooms red stains on the towels that didn‚Äôt look old cracked drinking glasses half used toiletry bottle put back with full ones and hair in the sheets.
50,Chela is the best host and Eric help out both very professional . My host is always there and I will be leaving a gift for her have a great rest of the year. But covid-19 has taken a lot of the fun for staying here hope all stay safe and hope it gets better
20,We arrived and were excited to stay here. We wanted to stay here several times in the past and finally had the chance. We were not impressed whatsoever with the room. We had a king room in the octavius tower. Looked great online but in person this place is a disaster. Besides being smaller than any other Vegas room we have stayed in it has dirty sheets dirty bathroom scuffed up trim work and furniture. Hair in the shower and tub. Scratches on the headboard. Even the housekeeping staff over the phone seemed unhappy and annoyed when we asked for more towels and such. Mask police everywhere disturbing everybody and yelling and making scenes. Just not the experience you expect at a 5-star Vegas property. Probably going to stay at MGM properties from now on.
10,I have always considered Caesars Palace to be the only choice for destinations in Las Vegas. Not anymore. I cannot believe how much it has changed. Caesars was over priced on everything. We were charged a Resort fee and we didn't even have room service. I had to call for clean towels. When towels were delivered they were left outside in front of our door even after I specifically called and asked them to just leave on floor Inside of our room. We paid extra for a better view from our room which we did get but the room itself looked dated and the couch in the room was dirty. I never even sat in the couch because it was not clean. The drinks were crazy expensive at the pool. I signed up for the Caesars Credit card for the perks. I went back to the check in counter to add the new Caesars Credit for my stay. When I got home noticed they never made the change so my new Caesars credit card was not used after I had waited in line in check in to make sure the new card would be used. so frustrating. We went to The Venetian to visit friends and they had all the services available to them Room service and daily cleaning of their room What a difference. I hope Caesars gets it together soon.
10,The check in process takes long. They didn't informed that we have to schedule an appointment to visit the pool area. Poor customer service. After I asked to use the pool I have to wait 7hrs for my turn unbelievable
30,I have always dreamed of staying at the famous Caesar Palace. However I was a bit disappointed on the rooms. The view was beautiful as we had a view of the pool. Staff is very friendly and the resort itself is amazing. But again the room was very disappointed. Missing light bulbs broken tv in bathroom phones don't work unless on speaker carpets dirty The mini bar was suppose to be locked but it was open a bit when we got there so I opened ot to find someone else's Starbucks cup and missing alcohol. Meaning they never cleaned the bar out. The hotel hallway smells horrible. When I Called about mini bar they said there should be nothing in there to begin with and that i wouldn't be charged for it. I went down next day to make sure my account was noted and it wasn't so the guy noted my account. I asked them to come fix it since the mini bar would not close properly and they couldn't because of Covid they can't enter the rooms. The day I go to check out i have fees because the mini bar is off from there end after I called and came down about it. They did fix it but it was annoying to repeat myself. Today I look at my receipt and I was charged for something else by mistake. It was overall ok.
50,Staying in the Hotel from the Hangover movies is probably the coolest experience I ever had growing up I stayed there in August 2017 when I was 14 years old and as a 14 year old staying in a glamorous beautiful hotel from a movie it was pretty spectacular the beds were so comfortable you‚Äôll never want to leave them the Egyptian cotton sheets give you a perfect nights sleep the staff are incredibly friendly and were very accommodating to Brits abroad!!
30,My stay was very difficult as I could not get a coffee maker or a refrigerator and I could not determine from day to day what restaurants were open. It is not at all what i would expect from this property
40,Caesars Palace is gorgeous! The decor is beautiful and the amenities are countless. I just wish they had more breakfast options since their buffet is obviously closed as a response to the pandemic. Be ready to spend $$$$$$$$$ for everything you need and want to do here. The experience made spending all the money worth it though. Everyone We encountered were polite. Check in and check out is simple and the location is at the heart of the strip. We got engaged in Las Vegas and my now fianc√© claimed he would love to stay at Caesar‚Äôs again.
10,Upon entering my room and despite there being a sticker on the door saying that it was sanitized there was food scattered everywhere dirty towels on the couch and in the bathroom the bed was stained dirty and unmade. After bringing this to the attention of the manager she upgraded me to to the forum classic suite (approximately a $40 upgrade). Upon entering this new room there were holes in the wall from what appeared to be from someone punching them as well as scratched furniture light fixtures that were out and used hand soap still in the bathroom. I then brought this to the attention of the front desk to ensure I didn‚Äôt get fined for the damages done and was thanked for bringing this to their attention and then dismissed.
30,We stayed at Caesars Palace for 5 nights in July. My only complaint was that there was NO housekeeping. I called Caesars twice before my visit to check and was told it was available upon request. However when I checked in I was told there was none. But I could have sheets delivered so I could make my bed. Understanding Covid I realize that changes need to be made but several other hotels offer housekeeping. I stayed in a suite and and don't feel it is acceptable to have guests paying a substantial amount for their room make there own beds and not cleaning the room at all.
50,Have to give all credit for an excellent 4 night stay to the staff. While in years past we have had mixed experiences the current staff and operations seem to have undergone a marked shift to the better. Despite dealing with a pandemic the staff was warm and welcoming  even in the face of some very difficult customers we noted. Special credit reserved for our front desk contact and casino host on duty. No fake sympathy on their part just honest diligent work for the customer which was appreciated. Room cleanliness was top notch and despite daily room services being curtailed at present trash removal and fresh towels were quickly available with a call. All of the staff responded to inquiries and requests in an a pleasant and eager manner. We were very impressed.  Final note if one has been on the fence about staying with Caesar's due to crowds I strongly reccomend visiting now as staying while the Hotel is only booking to 50% capacity makes for an extremely pleasant visit for those averse to excess hustle and bustle.
50,Must experience once in your life .  Only one down side is it‚Äôs so big that it may be quite a hike to your room.  I enjoyed it . Smash burger was my favorite. At the food court. Flamingo right across the street (sister hotel)
50,"I was supposed to be celebrating with family and friends at Paris Hotel when they all had to cancel due to the pandemic. But I already had booked time off to try and enjoy my birthday. I had a bad experience at the previous hotel and changed my reservation to Caesars.    Best choice I ever made that day!!    I had a warm Aloha greeting from the Front Desk check-in clerk named Gemma. I explained to her the terrible service I was receiving because my ID had expired as my birthday just passed and that due to COVID -19 the DMV offices were closed so I could not renew it. She understood and she apologized for the problems I experienced from ""the other hotels as they are all part of the Caesar's family. ""    Gemma quickly helped me out and even upgraded my room to an Augustus room 3396. She told me some important information about the hotel and directions where the elevators to my room were. And then wished me best of luck and hoped I would enjoy my stay there.    When i got to my room I was taken back!! I really enjoyed the comforts of my room from the magnificent decor and set up of the room to the amazing views of Las Vegas and the pool outside my window.    Boy am I glad that there are people like Gemma working at the Caesar's property it shows that Caesar's genuinely cares about there guests and the experience they have during their vacation. Thanks so much for turning a bad 2 days to a memorable last day!!"
10,Pervert staff make u feel uncomfortable I went to ask a question the guy at the podium outside checked out my 13 yr old looking at her up n down licking his lips. We went to mgm the next day made us feel disrespected and like pieces of meat. Also the casino is so big you cant get in to the pool we paid hotel fees and couldn‚Äôt t even use then pool. Thank you for ur time
50,I always have a great time at Caesars Palace but I came here to give a quick shout out to Osae who works the Diamond check-in. I've had the pleasure of her checking me in a few times now. She remembers me and seems genuinely interested in how to improve my stay while exhibiting the professionalism I've come to expect from Caesar's Palace. Osae was kind enough to go over how the hotel and casino have stepped up their standards since the pandemic giving me peace of mind I don't feel I have when I stay at other properties.    Thanks for doing a great job and keeping your standards high. I'll be back soon.
10,"My husband and I have been coming to Caesar's Palace for nearly twenty years as Diamond or Seven Stars players. We arrived July 19 2020 and checked into the Palace Tower. We were informed that there would be no room service which you would think would be the ultimate ""social distancing"" dining experience but were told that due to Covid-19 there was none. All of the mini bar itemsand coffee makers were also removed from the rooms. None of the nightclubs were open not that we cared about that; just omitted from disclosing to us upon making our reservations. Upon check in we were also advised that there would be no housekeeping service either and we should place used towels and garbage in the hallway for pickup. I am sure you can picture what the hallways looked like. It was utterly disgusting. Due to a medical condition my husband was not able to wear the type of face mask that Caesars deemed acceptable but was accepted by Delta Airlines and every venue during our trip to Las Vegas and which was ordered for us by my husband's physician before traveling. He was denied all gaming services due to his inability to wear their preferred type of mask even though his mask was perfectly adequate to quell coughs and sneezes. He was refused a ""marker"" at the Casino Cage. He has had credit at Caesar's for the past ten years and has perfect credit and always paid off the marker upon returning home. Since we prefer not to carry large amounts of cash on our flight and to and from the casino for obvious reasons this has always been our method to access cash at the casinos. We left the casino traveled a short distance to The Venetian took out a ""marker"" there and had no problem playing in their casino. Upon returning to the hotel to go to sleep we were started by a homeless man urinating in the front lawn at Ceasars and another one sleeping nearby in the bushes. On the Caesar's Casino Floor we did not witness one cocktail waitress serving patrons even considering ALL of the bars including the video poker bars were closed. Needless to say when we arrived back in our room we booked the first flight back home (even paying double what our regular flight home would have been on July 23rd) and checked out the next day on the evening of July 20th. We were in Las Vegas less than thirty hours.  I should also note that you are also required to wear a face mask OUTDOORS at the pool areas unless you are in the water. Makes a lot of sense doesn't it? The lines for the pool began at 7:00 am for the pool opening a 9:00 a.m. although I cannot tell you why people would want to go outside in 106 degree weather with a mask on. I can tell you that Las Vegas appeared to be like one of the ""ghost towns"" that you visited nearby in that there were very few suckers (I mean guests) who were willing to spend their hard earned money on a very dismal vacation destination.  At a time when cleanliness should be paramount Caesar's Palace was an utterly disgusting filthy mess of what was once a name associated with oppulance and glamour. I sure hope that Eldorado Resorts realized that upon purchasing Caesars Resorts after their bankruptcy. Hopefully they received a good enough deal to pay the lawsuits that I am sure will occur when some attorney connects with someone patrons (like us) who realizes that Caesar's Resorts discriminates against The Americans with Disabilities Act with their illogical ""mask policy"" and dehumanizing treatment of their guests."
10,Don‚Äôt believe the commercials 80% of the strip is closed including whole casinos restaurants and bars. Limited or no drink service while playing. Inconsistent rules of how many at each table some with dividers some without. Still trying to keep table limits jacked up despite no one playing. We actually bought new plane tickets to leave a day early! Wait until this is truly over before wasting money to go back. And the young woman at reception working the kiosks was clueless and rude wish I got her name.
20,I would like to say that the horel staff is very friendly however the room they gave me was not good since the AC was too cold and could not be regulated and I woke up with my throat sore from the cold that passes . and the fouset the sink are The water came out from above and the mirrors in the room were dirty and the papers had no bags I don't think I will stay at Caesar again
10,We had to stay overnight in LV when our car broke down and chose a big hotel over a smaller one with outside direct access to a room because we assumed the bigger hotels would have more reliably disinfected rooms. Our room was sealed and spotless but the problem is the way the hotel is designed. Unless you valet park for even more money you have to walk through the entire casino to get to the lobby which was more COVID exposure than we've had in 3 months. I asked why they can't put some of their self-service check-in kiosks (which didn't work for us even though we had a pre-paid reservation done online on the hotel's website) at the other end of the hotel and the answer was again that that's the way the hotel is designed. I guess we'll know in 2 weeks if this was a worse mistake than it seemed but definitely avoid big hotels (or better yet Las Vegas in general) if COVID is your concern.
30,Brought a group of 23 for our office ‚ÄúChristmas in July‚Äù party the check in process was a disaster. Due to COVID they were a little stressed out. Before arrival I had my employees room assignments attached to the room and credit card attached as well. They told us at check in they needed an ID for each person to be able to charge. However they were not prepared for this process and made other guest very angry when they would take others in my group from the VERY LONG check in line in front of other guest.  One of the rooms had one king when it should have been two queens. It took two hours to resolve and move rooms. No maid service due to COVID and you could only get new towels upon request. I requested more the very first day and after three phone calls two days later we FINALLY received them. No room service due to Covid.  Rented a 1000.00 cabana and the misters didn‚Äôt work. Pool opened at 8 on this day however we were told 9:00 food and drink service didn‚Äôt start until 11:00. So not worth $1000.00.    The hotel was clean rooms are older and pretty small for a Vegas hotel. Definitely time to update and improve the customer service.
20,I visited Caesars this past weekend for a short getaway & wish I would of booked another hotel. The pool situation is a big joke you have to text just to get on the waiting list. It‚Äôs not fair to hotel guest to have to wait to get in the pool when it should be a time limit & you shouldn‚Äôt be able to go back to back if you already went to the pool. Who wants to sit around all day waiting on a text for you to come down so stupid on their end. I stayed in the octavious tower & the ac don‚Äôt blow as cold as it should which is so pathetic because it‚Äôs 115 degrees there. Oh & they don‚Äôt clean the room I had to steal towels from the house keeping cart because they never came to my room. I took enough to last me for two days & I took tub cleaner so I can clean the jacuzzi tub. That‚Äôs about the only thing I enjoyed during this stay with them & the scooters that you can rent since the deuce is barely running.
10,First time at Caesars Palace and it will be the LAST visit. We Ck out tomorrow and we (3 guests) have been nothing but disappointed in Caesars Palace. They do not clean up the rooms had to beg for additional towels and toilet paper. Seems the hotel was MORE concerned with a mask being over your nose than they were in keeping guests attended to. The room has dirty rugs and could not get a hot shower in the 4 days we have been here. Every morning I went down to the lobby to play at a machine in order to flag down a server to get a cup of coffee. Each morning I had to flag down a manager and waited thru 3 or 4 requests to get a cup of coffee. 45 minutes later I would FINALLY get a small cup of coffee. BTW did not see a lot of customers winning at their casino machines. We will definitely NOT ever recommend this place as a good place to stay. What a disappointment. Will tell all my friends and family NOT to book a stay at s hotel. Try Park MGM you will get a better experience. Or the Bellagio. Our friend stayed there the same time we stayed at Caesars and when she complained about some rude associates she was offered a comped dinner at their best steak house along with a bottle of fine wine. We couldn‚Äôt even get an extra roll of toilet paper. Won‚Äôt EVER stay at Caesars Palace again.
50,"The Caesar""s Pool was nice & refreshing! The Staff was courteous professional and friendly. I had fun throughout Caesar's amenities. Great exceptional Customer Service from two of your Staff: Xandra and Christina! Thanks for help making my experience 2nd to none! The rooms were roomy and house keeping was very responsive to my needs. Thanks again."
40,Cabana pool day. Experienced the best service and accommodations at the Venus pool. Leo our cabana host was the most accommodating host we have experience at any hotel pool.he went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. He was checking up on us throughout the day. Also our waitress Elenor or Elie was very prompt I. Getting our drinks and food tho right the day. The team of Leo and Elie were the dynamic duo every person in our group had nothing but praise for both of them. I hope Ceasars prolly takes note of this and should commend them for their hard work and dedication. They single handily made our trip one of the best experiences every to Vegas and we go very often.
50,My wife & I are having a wonderful time here @ Ceasar‚Äôs Palace in LV the week of July 21st 2020. Many restaurants are open with many dinning options to choose from and the resort is keeping our safety a real priority! Way to go Ceasar‚Äôs üëçüèº
40,"We stayed Thursday-Sunday at Caesars in the Octavius tower. No complaints about our room we got a corner room by the elevators and a great view of the pool. Room was comfortable clean & spacious. I do have to say with being by the elevator I thought it would be loud but other than our 1 obnoxious neighbors we didn't hear any noise from the hallway. The closer towers to the casino seemed to be quite a bit busier than the Octavius. Also it is a pretty decent walk to the casino from these towers.    My main complaint about this hotel is 1. we tried for 2 nights to get on roulette and black jack table and with all the COVID crap we were not able to so we ended up gambling at other hotels. For as busy as it is you would think they would open up more tables. Although seats were limited you were back to back with other players which defeated the idea of ""social distancing"". 2. The pool reservation system is so unorganized and the people running it are rude as hell! After a lot of back and forth multiple days we ended up renting a day bed at the Neptune. Our server Anna was nice in the beginning and got pretty aggrivated towards the end of her shift. She even called out another guest for not tipping her enough in front of a bunch of people. Definitely unprofessional! On the other hand KJ who works at the pool (not sure what his title is) was awesome! He was on the ball with everything we needed and checked on us regularly! 3. The Caesars reward center needs an attitude adjustment there are no perks for being a higher up tier member while this is going on and the lady basically told us we don't have to do anything for you guys just be glad were open. Um no you guys should be glad we chose to spend our money at your hotel. Will not be staying here again. Try Cosmo more fun atmosphere and they actually want you there."
50,Remember to ask for room cleaning if you stay more than 2 days. They did not clean my room and i thought it would automatically clean my room. Anyway it was great place to stay. My family was really enjoyed the room view and shopping with brand names stores.
20,Me and my girlfriend booked at Caesars for a quick get away from the kids. We were very underwhelmed as we have stayed at several hotels and resorts on the strip. Caesars has to be the oldest most outdated room I have stayed in thus far. The front desk attendant up saw this on a room we believed we had already purchased through Expedia. We agreed to pay the additional $40 per night with no problem because of the view we believed we were getting of the strip. The view was very lackluster and then we had to virtually peek around the corner to see the strip. The room was abnormally hot at night even though we had our temperature set to the lowest setting. It seems the AC could never keep up with the heat in the hotel. We contacted the front desk they acted as if there was nothing they could do. We were sold on Caesar‚Äôs being one of the best properties on the strip when in actuality it‚Äôs just one of the oldest!
10,Staff extremely rude & treats you like a 2 year old. We had to pay $75.00 to use the in room refrigerator for our own stuff no in room coffee makers and lines forever at coffee stand! Couldn‚Äôt get towels brought to our room. Had to call 3 times and wait for hours. No room service and if this was truly about social distancing - what better way than to eat in your own room!! Not an option here. Everything is closed or closes very early due to corona excuse. Pool time wasn‚Äôt even an option for us. Not waiting in line for 2 hours to maybe/possibly get in. Forget that!! Again the staff was extremely rude if you take your mask down under your nose for 5 seconds with no one within 50 feet of you staff will come running from across the casino at you screaming ‚Äúput your mask over your nose!‚Äù Now come on Caesers- if this is truly about social distancing no need to act this way. Last time I checked this is still America!! Couldn‚Äôt even take a sip of a drink without them flipping out and going ballistic on you. And the machines are as cold as ice!! Don‚Äôt waste your time or money staying here unless you enjoy being treated like crap losing a ton of money and having zero benefits.
10,Our first trip to Vegas was a complete let down. Booked a room specifically with a tub and it was broke. Although our hallway had numerous unused room we were not offered anything. Told that after we left they would fix it because they had to take the bath tub apart. We were told complimentary drinks while gambling and while there we didn‚Äôt get served at all had a waitress take our order 3 different times but never returned with the drinks. We were so thirsty had to go to a shop and buy a drink. Staff were rude one the first day arriving we had no idea where we were going in the hotel and couldn‚Äôt get anyone to help us and we were pouring in sweat going in circles looking how to get to our rooms and was stopped by the Wyndham scam and we told them no thank you and they said they worked for caesers and would help us to our room. This was a lie and wasted our time. It makes no sense why a resort fee is being charged currently I couldn‚Äôt even access the pool 2 days of my 5 day trip because they were full and they do not have any cleaning service over the 5 days we stayed. Went to speak with host before leaving who wasn‚Äôt helpful. It was a disappointing trip.
50,Ceasars Palace LV have stepped ul their game area cleanliness and have the best staff around speacial thanks to Ivan Valino ( total rewards desk staff) for his best effort in making the guests happy. Thanks again! great job!
30,Was not notified before my trip that ALL the bar were closed and that you have to wear a mask at the pools wife got told she couldn't wipe her face... NO common sense...Room had a sticker on the door that it was sanitized...Just would like my room cleaned and the carpet & floors no dirty also please wipe down all surfaces so they are not sticky...(Sanitize Dirt)... They just want to spray sanitizer everywhere..
10,Poor customer service.They are rude and not helpful at all. $51 per day resort fee is a total scam. Main pool is freezing cold if you want to use 2nd largest pool that is warmer get ready to pay $150 per person per day if you was not lucky to get a free limited quantity wrist band at 9AM long line of another guests. Asked manager at the main reception desk to allow me and my wife go to the warmer pool one time per week of our stay due to my wife's medical condition she cant stand freezing water and manager asked if she can call EMS for her! Really?? Smoke smell everywhere even marijuana.Refrigerator is not for personal use can not stick even small bottle of water in it. Prices for use anything out of fridge awful ($11.99 for 500ml bottle of Fiji Water) for example. Not even coffee maker in the room. No breakfast place open other than one or on some days two Starbucks on the property. Everything is overpriced. Do not waste your money on this disrespectful place. Very disappointed. Will never stay at any Caesar's properties again!
20,"Understanding that we went close to the reopening of Vegas we knew things would be different. However we wrongly assumed that a hotel the caliber of Caesars would be going over the top to take care of their guests knowing that the experience wasn't the norm. However it felt more like they went over the top to make sure you knew this was a terrible time to be in Vegas. With bars closed and shows cancelled there was not a lot to do so you would think the pool would be a nice escape. However they were limiting the pool hours and limiting guests to 30% unless you wanted to pay extra (a lot extra) for a cabana. Pool opened at 8 we put our name on the list at 9:30 and at 4:15 (pool closed at 5) we were told there was an opening. To make matters worse at every Caesar's casino we went to they had someone trying to sell you on giving you ""coupons"" for free items but you had to pay up front and get your money back later after you used the coupon. Seriously they couldn't just say ""we know things are bad right now so we want you to have a $50 credit for food."" Nope they want you to give them money in order to get a ""coupon."" The table games were a high limit even in the off times the staff were overly stuck up no house cleaning the entire time and then they still charged us $50 resort fees for the entire stay. That's right no bars no shows no house cleaning no pool and yet still paid a resort fee. Extremely disappointed and will not stay here ever again. We understand things are hard and that was one reason we wanted to go to get out there and start supporting the economy but it felt like there should be some give and take on both parts and adding the resort fee at the end just seemed the last straw in lack of hospitality."
10,I can‚Äôt even begin to describe how awful our service was. My husband and I booked multiple rooms for guests of our wedding on hotels.com we then booked their double duplex Julius suite directly on their website for our wedding weekend. We talked to their customer service line multiple times verifying our suite. The day before our wedding we go to check in to our suite they tell us it‚Äôs not ready even though we paid for early check in. They then put us in the conjoining suite room we booked. Shortly after we find out they didn‚Äôt even book us for the right suite. We had to talk to the front desk about 5-6 times demanding the suite we paid for. They tell us the people in that suite decided to stay an extra night and that they don‚Äôt kick people out of rooms even if you booked it weeks prior when it was available. Finally they do put us in a different Julius duplex suite. In the process we had already unpacked and needed to switch rooms. My key card wouldn‚Äôt work and their inept security guard told me she wouldn‚Äôt let me in that room to get my bags since it was marked ‚Äúunoccupied.‚Äù Finally we get to the suite although this one was not as big and smelled like smoke + the furniture was scratched. Terrible customer service and stress for a bride & groom coming to Vegas after their original plans were cancelled due to Covid. We spent thousands on hotel rooms at Caesars for what should have been an easy process only to spend almost an entire day trying to get what we paid for.
30,It was cool but the bottom of the bathtub was super loose and the room was sealed as if was cleaned and sanitized but there was another Seal sticker from b4 on the back of the door. Kinda expected more from caesars palace honestly but other then that it was cool
40,It was a great customer service i did felt safe  although pool amd some places where drinking its allowed did not felt 100% safe . and enjoyed the stay. All the employees at the hotel  are heroes couse not only had to owrk during pandemic but they had a great customer service and a great attitude at all times. 5 stars on that also the security measures and the mask all over the place and gell was good. sadly we came dirung the second lock down not much activites to do :(
50,Enjoyed my trip. Excellent location and staff very nice and helpful. The rooms were very clean and the food was great. I definitely recommend this place if you going to Vegas for a trip. You won't be disappointed
30,I just spent the of 7/19 and 7/20 at Cesars. The service was excellent as usual and my room in Octavius was roomy and overlooked the pool. The problem is all the bars are closed including the slot bars. You can't get a drink in the casino unless you are playing at the slots or the tables. Saturday there was a line and wait list for the pool since pool capacity is limited to 25%.. By 11:00 you had to be a Diamond or renting a cabana to get in the pool. I recommend renting a cabana if you have a larger group and can afford it. Also the Qua spa is closed. The mask rule was heavily enforced by security and floor managers. I couldn't have a drink in the casino without someone telling me to pull up my mask. It made be a while before it gets back to normal.
20,Hotel was okay but would have preferred better quality of room and service. Upon arrival room was dusty and headboard was peeling. Also the room had a sticker on door so say room was cleaned and sanitized but it was full of dust and the tub sink and showerhead faucets were full of calcium build up and water was blue. I had to contact guest services 3 times before issue was partially resolved. We did not have pool access the 3 days we were there due to limited capacity and its only open from 9 to 5 at the hottest time of the day. Next time we will book at Harrahs Planet Hollywood or MGM!
10,Checkin agent didn‚Äôt know anything couldn‚Äôt answer basic questions. Room  Was not clean had to have a room  Change still not much better . Hotel staff just didn‚Äôt care . Will NEVER stay here again!!!!!!!
50,This hotel is amazing! We got a suite and it was just perfect. We didnt even have to leave the hotel only to go ziplining... The Forum is beautiful. I walked out with a pair of C.Louboutin heels and a brand new Yves Saint Laurent purse. I probably should stay away from the Forum next time lol.. The pool was fun. We got lucky with some machines. It was great! Overall I would recommend this place in a heartbeat :)
50,Hey Michelle at diamond check in thank you so much for all the good vibes and hard work to always make us customers feel loved . Keep dancing keep being Great  love your favorite diamond guest . Appreciate you
40,The air conditioner in my room 1630 and hallway leading to my room was extremely hot. The air in the room was up and down. We left a day early. Was very surprised. Someone dropped white liquid on dresser quickly reported that. That furniture should be change. Not a good look for Caesars Palace.
10,"From the moment we checked in we had trouble. The guy running the Express check out/in was rude and very unpleasant and didn't help me or my fiance at all. My Fiance and I wanted to stay some where nice and beautiful to celebrate out new engagement. But Caesars completely ruined it. We went to the pool and got harrassed by the pool employees. The clock stuck 6 pm. They started telling everyone to get out of the pool because it was closed. We were sitting inside the swim up bar shaded area. I started collecting my belongings and proceeded to walk out. Mind you I have a injured knee so it takes me longer then a normal person to walk. By this time it is 6:03 pm. The pool employees took it upon themselves to scream at me and my fiance as we are already walking out of the pool area screaming ""GET OUT NOW!!!!"" another employee screams "" LIKE TODAY PEOPLE!!!"" as we are already out the water. I felt so embarrassed and disrespected. Honestly I feel like getting my attorney involved. This is not how you treat your paying guest let alone someone who had a knee injury who can't move that fast."
50,Excellent accommodation/staff/Covid precautions!!!  My first room that was assigned by reservation desk was far from the elevator that I requested. Since it was his first day in the job I ended way far the elevator. The room was great except for a Senior citizen who had knee surgery it was a far walk . So I was transferred & I‚Äôm very much relieved & satisfied after.
10,Wife‚Äôs first trip to Vegas and doubt I can get her back after that. $50 check in early fee (4:00 half the day is gone) room was dirty with hair on floor couch had stains shower leaked $75 to unlock fridge and the dealers were rude as can be.  Won‚Äôt be back
50,Excellent service and quality. Staff was outstanding and took pride in the high level of Customer Service they provided.  This facility was very clean and didn‚Äôt show the property‚Äôs real age.  Love the Virtual Feature. Saves a lot of time.
50,Caesar is by far the best hotel we stayed at in Las Vegas. Very Clean staff is friendly.  We stayed at the Augustus which faces the Bellagio Fountain and the Strip and it was just so beautiful at night . They have great slot machines and I came back a winner üòÉ
20,we got 2 rooms in palace tower for my daughter's 21st birthday. Both rooms NEVER cooled off below 82 degrees. No clean sticker on one room hand prints and oily stuff on the windows. Rooms were pre paid but still chaged $600+ additional at check in. Too tired to hassle with changing rooms as we needed 2 rooms together. Most things closed due to Covid. Face mask rules were enforced but more cleaning should have been done as pool chairs are dirty. Very poor experience sad to see a great hotel go down.
30,My boyfriend and I stayed here during July for 3 nights. The room was wonderful; however the AC didn‚Äôt work properly and the bathtub had a broken faucet. Due to the AC malfunction we weren‚Äôt able to sleep comfortably.
50,We took our three daughters for a five night stay and were beyond satisfied with the service rooms and pools....especially considering CP reopened only THREE days prior to our Sunday arrival.  We understood and expected this trip to be much more laid back with a little less hustle and bustle and it was just so relaxing!  There were a decent variety of bars and restaurants to enjoy during our stay between the three Caesars properties that were open during our stay (CP Flamingo and Harrahs) so we didn‚Äôt feel deprived.    We were initially a little concerned with whether staff would be welcoming having to return following the shutdown but ALL of the Caesars team members we interacted with were upbeat and friendly with the exception of one lone cocktail waitress at the Flamingo. She genuinely seemed to dislike her position begrudgingly serving my daughters after bypassing them (and a couple other patrons) a few times. Meh - it happens though.  Our only other concern specific to CP was that both of our rooms did not have the red seal on the door to signify they were sanitized (rooms 2649 and 2650). They DID however appear clean so we just wiped everything down with the Clorox wipes we packed (just in case).    We‚Äôd like to also recognize Cat Moses and Lee at the Venus Pool who were absolutely amazing! We rented a cabana Monday and Wednesday and had a wonderful time.    We thank you for truly living up to your reputation ‚Äî‚Äî it is well deserved!
50,"Just checked in the room for our 5th Anniversary very excited... when we got to the room it didn't have the pool view we asked for and had the last time we stayed. I called guest services and asked to change to a pool view and the man who answered said he couldn't get it authorized. But asked me to hold for a few minutes. When he returned the man said they were unable to switch our room and just kept repeating himself ""Yeah there just are no guarantees for a view sorry."" It is at 25% capacity and we come here often. Then my boyfriend said he was going to talk to someone in person. We went down and asked Bryan who wasn't busy standing by the counter. We asked if it'd be at all possible to switch our room. And he explained we could stand in line and ask an agent but we probably won't get the answer we want because of the cleaning process for Covid. We talked a bit more and he said ""Hang on a second."" Bryan came back with a smile (in his eyes-he wore a mask) and handled it like a boss. We have our room with a view. Thanks to Bryan with a Y we didn't leave. It was nice to finally have kindness rewarded. I've never thought highly of those who yell cause a scene or be the squeaky wheel but boy were we disappointed after the phone call. I hope people continue to reward those who are kind and don't have expectations. We are used to not getting what we want because we never cause a stink. This was awesome!"
50,The best experience in Vegas. Have your personal concierge 24/7 text message away does everything for you from restaurant reservations all the way to even housekeeping needs. Me and my wife always love it here. See you next time Caesar's Palace.
50,Was a great experience from start to finish. From Delanos help during check in to the awesomeness of the rooms and the incredible resteraunts and shopping I give this hotel 2 thumbs up. Was just an overall great time. I will definetly return again.
10,"Im a returning Diamond Member who had an issue after check in. Normally I let these things go but my recent say over the July 4th weekend needs to go formally in the books as the worst treatment I've ever received by a Front Desk manager. Staying at Caesars Palace this time (as a returning guest who had stayed there 3 weeks earlier). My issue was related to specific treatment by the Front Desk (Main entrance). I requested to speak to the Manager after informing my Diamond Status this year was only a few hundred points off. I had actually met the Diamond Status this year but the system takes 24-48 hours to update. My question was whether Management could waive the Resort Fees (whose really using the pool now in COVID?) for a guest who is an avid gambler. The Front Desk manager made a phone calll and advised me no. I had a calm conversation that addressed whether it made sense for Caesars to comp $135 vs the $5000 I would spend in the Bellagio  keeping in mind I had already spent more than $3000 in Caesars at this point. The manager said the decision was final and basically to have a nice day. This was in the morning of the 2nd to the last day of my stay at Ceasars. I immediately walk over to Americano Bistro to have breakfast with my Guest. To my surprise the charges on my bill could not be attached to my room. The Local Manager had ""vindictively"" checked me out of my room 1 full day early. Needless to say I was shocked and saddened to Casars would treat a loyal guest in this manner. From my Phone I contacted Guest Services at the Hotel and they promptly checked me back in so I could complete my stay. I understand that even Hotel Employees can hold grudges and be upset. However to use Caesars Palace Money of which I am a Public Stockholder  to be ""vindictive"" is totally beyond the allowable norms."
10,The staff are completely unprofessional with the COVID guidelines. They harass you and make snide comments that are inappropriate.  The pool guidelines are contradictory and senseless . You pay money to be treated like a prisoner.
10,I was so excited to visit Caesars Palace for the 1st time. A high class up scale venue. I am so disappointed. My room was not clean the shower had black hair everywhere. My sofa had white stains on it. Sheets had stains on them. I slept on the top duvet as I did not want to touch the sheets. So disappointed. I will not be staying at Caesars Palace ever again nor will I recommend them. In addition my company was charged as well as myself. Double charged.
50,We had the pleasure of staying at Caesar's for the first time July 5-July 12 2020. We have been to Vegas about 25 times and without a doubt this experience was very different. The hotel is massive but easy to get the lay of the land after a few days. Due to the pandemic many restaurants were closed but we were always able to find a great place to dine. Mesa Grill was one of the finest meals of our trip our server Chris was great. We also really enjoyed Lobby Bar and Alto Lounge both had excellent drinks and service.    Cleanliness and mask protocols were strictly followed during the entire time we were there. Masks were required at all times on the property even in the gym during workouts and at the pool. Was this inconvenient and uncomfortable of course it was. However thinking and caring people realize that we are in a pandemic so as the British say stiff upper lip! Never once was I concerned for our safety mask and sanitizer stations are easily found throughout the hotel.    One of the major highlights of our trip was the room it was incredible. At Diamond check-in when I told Ray that this was my first time ever staying at Caesar's he made sure that we had an incredible room and made sure that our stay was AMAZING!!! A big thanks to Ray of Diamond check-in for really making our trip special. Because of him I know that we will be back at Caesar's again very soon.    Vegas during the pandemic is not for the faint of heart. If you are a ridiculous anti-vaxxer or mask Freedom Fighter please don't come and ruin it for the rest of us who can easily follow the rules! For those of you who do come Caesar's was a fantastic place to stay and I highly recommend it! And if you are Diamond or Seven Stars ask for Ray he will take great care of you!
50,I loved staying in Caesars. Initially I was rather daunted by the sheer size of the place but as our time went on I felt much more confident with Caesars as I got to know my way around. We were lucky enough to get to use the pool one afternoon in October - it was a gorgeous experience and one I would like to repeat!  Room was immaculate and staff were friendly and helpful.  I will return!
40,My friends and I visited the end  Of June. The room in the Augustus tower was nicely appointed and very clean. View was good but I‚Äôm never in the room so that doesn‚Äôt matter as much. What does matter and it is not the hotel‚Äôs fault are people smoking Weed in their rooms. Non smoking floors. It has happened at all of the other Vegas hotels so this was not an exception. We smell it on the Strip and Downtown but people will do what they do and it Didn‚Äôt ruin our trip at all. This is a beautiful property with great staff-Delano at the Front Desk is a gem and Danny at the cabanas is fabulous. Didn‚Äôt gamble here as the mins are too high for me and they had also reached their limits with 3 or 4 people when I would walk up. Highly recommend staying here. Atmosphere staff pool-everything is top notch.
10,I've been staying at Caesars for 3 decades and my recent stay was the most disappointing I can recall. Right from the beginning this started out a bad experience. The check-in kiosks didn't work right and employees insisted I use them. I should have just left and gone back to the airport. Unfortunately I didn't. My room had a non-view and the furniture was dated and beat up. NO room service -- what the ??? The casino floor stunk of smoke but for the most part the casino floor employees were friendly. Impossible to get a table for 1 at the several on-property restaurants if you didn't have a reservation at least a day in advance. The partially opened food court had to suffice but wait time there was even close to an hour for overpriced junk. The restaurants I ate at later in the stay after making reservations in advance lacked the quality they had in the past. The worst one was Nobu -- it was just awful and at a stupid high price -- avoid this one. My so-called host was worthless in all regards and didn't bother to answer his phone or return calls. A total disappointment and property fail.
30,When we opened the door to our room it was disgusting. It hadn‚Äôt been cleaned and had a horrible smell. When I went to report it to the front desk they were not apologetic. It was if they didn‚Äôt believe me. Probably won‚Äôt stay here again.
30,Upon arrival I requested to upgrade my room for a better quality of stay in a non smoking room. But when I go into my room It smelled like a smoking room and unfortunately my daughter noticed it right away too. I called to complain and I was asked to go to the main lobby instead. Once I was there I was not given the option to move very disappointed. I paid more for a better room and was not satisfied.
50,My first time in Caesar‚Äôs out of many times in Vegas. Best stay so far. Love the hotel and the service. Want to recognize ZANDRA at the front desk who checked us inn and who went above and beyond to make our stay special since it was my birthday. Professional polite understanding. Great experience overall!!!!
20,I was so exited to visit this hotel but as soon as I checked in I realized that I had made a mistake. Pools are beautiful but the water was so cold that it was hard to stay inside longer than 20 minutes. I rented a private cabana and water temperature was better there we paid $409.00 for a day plus $56 tip location was supper but the cabana need it some cleaning. Employees at the bar were super nice but the rest were super rude. The room wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting. I don‚Äôt think I am ever coming back to Caesars palace.
50,It doesn‚Äôt get much better then Caesars Palace. Attention to detail and cleanliness is impressive. Check in was easy and service was top notch. Room was upgraded and an offer to stay an extra night complimentary. Thank You Caesars Palace.
40,We stayed at the Palace tower over the 4th of July weekend which is right by the pool and we had a blast. The rooms was overlooking the Garden of the Gods pool and our bathroom was ridiculous. In the casino and hallways everybody was forced to wear mask... and they were pretty strict so I always felt safe. Even in the pool area a mask had be worn but of course in the pool all bets were off :)
40,This is the fourth time staying at Caesar's first time in the Octavius Tower. The room was nice and clean. A few of the extra amenities were missing likely due to the Covid restrictions. One minor issue arose when I used the spa tub. When I turned on the spa jets built up gunk in the pipes came out. I assume I was the first person to use the spa function since the reopening several weeks prior. When I checked out I brought up this issue at the front desk. Without asking the lady checking me out deducted one night of resort fees. Which was exactly what I was going to ask for.
10,Rooms are extremely outdated there are stains on the furniture. I could gobs of hair in the shower that wasn‚Äôt mine. The mini fridge charges if you want to keep anything of your own in it. The whole thing was just NO
10,This hotel like all the others are lying to us about CDC guidelines. I can‚Äôt get my refrigerator or my room cleaned daily. I just looked up the CDC guidelines you can google it. Nowhere does it mention about using a refrigerator or the frequency of cleaning rooms. A worker at another resort told me the hotel wants you to order room service and not put in a refrigerator so you spend more money. They cleaning staff are not enough. They make more on unemployment than what the hotel pays so the hotels are greatly understaffed. Than there is the mask gustapo that will demand you put mask on AND cover your nose. Don‚Äôt come to Vegas and especially this one if you want a relaxing and peaceful rest...
40,I just completed a 7 night stay at Caesars palace and was impressed with all new protocols to limit the spread of Corona Virus. The recent mandate of wearing masks was greatly appreciated.    I was upgraded to a spacious suite with a jacuzzi tub that I made good use of.    Thank you Caesars for making it safe to stay at your properties. I‚Äôm looking forward to my next visit.
10,Every time I would call about a problem no one apologized and always stated that I needed to call a different department. No one took accountability or cared. This was the worst experience I have had in vegas and will not be coming back.
20,I go to Vegas every year and this year I decided to stay at Cesar‚Äôs Palace. I was excited especially since this is the first time I stayed at this particular hotel. The pictures of the room on the website look amazing and comfortable. And I know they had just remodeled so I know the room was going to be very nice. I checked in July 2nd When I entered the room  My heart dropped because instantly I thought this had to be a mistake. The room looked like a motel. The floor had some weird dust in the couch had some weird stains. The cabinet had scratches like there was a tiger in the room.  The TV was entirely too small. This was nothing how I expected especially how well-known this hotel is I was very disappointed. I wish I can get half of my money back on this disappointment. The only time I stayed in the room was to shower and go to sleep other than that I went to my friends room that was staying at the Venetian. I expected more from Cesars. It was falsely advertised. The pictures look like a different hotel. Great staff though!
50,Because we were traveling during uncertain times I made sure before we got here to call the resort check online reviews and did a little research. With that being said we had the MOST AMAZING time here at Caesars‚Äôs Palace!! Check in was good there was a long line but they worked quick and we were checked in within a timely manner! All the employees were helpful and answered any questions we had! We stayed in the Augustus tower and our room had a seal on the door that it was clean and sanitized! And it sure was!! The room was clean and very spacious!! The tub was a whirlpool tub and it was probably the best we‚Äôve every had!! It was huge!! While here we went to Vanderpump Gardens Cafe Americano and Hell‚Äôs Kitchen. We made reservations for Hell‚Äôs Kitchen and were not disappointed!! Now for the pool! As expected during a time like this that the pools would be crowded so we went ahead and booked a cabana at the Venus pool!! And let me tell you it was worth every penny!! We were able to walk past the long line of people waiting to get in the pool and were escorted to the pool! The service was amazing and the drinks were great! The cabana was huge and was probably the best part of our trip!! Overall we had the best experience ever and will be back soon! My only advice is do some research so you know exactly what to expect when you are here! This will help with planning and making the best of your time here!! Thank you Caesars for an amazing time!!
30,Given the current situation I'd have expected lower prices and/or incentives for those that decided to make the trip. The pools were separated and you had to pay $500+ to rent a chair to access the biggest pool. Thus the majority of the guests were crammed into the smaller pool then advised that they could not sit inside the pool on the edge nor stand near the edge of the pool while in the pool. Overall we were disappointed.
10,"Extremely disappointed. We wanted to have a little weekend get away in a nice room. Knowing that because of the current times with Covid we would not be out experiencing normal Las Vegas entertainment and we would be spending most of our time in our room. We booked the Palace Premium King Suite with marble tub and two bathrooms. Before entering your room there is a bright red sticker on the door confirming that the room had been cleaned. This was very reassuring. When we entered the room was very nice. HOWEVER when entering one bathroom my husband noticed what appeared to be dried mucus on the wall beside the mirror. We were disgusted. We reported it to the front desk and showed them the pictures we took. They offered us $50 food credit and a room equivalent or a slight upgrade. I am not a difficult person I understand things can happen (even thought this was pretty obvious and because of these circumstances regarding cleanliness and public health I was a little more concerned). We then had to move our stuff (we weren't offered a bellman's assistance we had to ask for it). Keep in mind this already after driving 5 hrs to get there and around 11pm.    Once in our replacement room we were so disappoint. It was definitely NOT equivalent to the room I had paid for and booked. We were placed in a room in the Augustus Tower one bathroom extremely small closet. I was paying for a lesser room. Again back to report to the front desk. Now reaching about 1am the gentleman was very understanding and offered us an additional $50 food credit and waived resort fee. Advised us to come back later in the morning and we could get our room changed.    Round II. We go back in the morning and we get our room changed to a suite that we had originally booked. We moved and carried our stuff again back to the Palace tower. I was pleased with the room. HOWEVER as my husband accessed the ironing board in the closet he says ""You're not going to believe this!"" there was a pair of shoes and dirty wadded up pillow case on the floor. It just leaves me extremely concerned as to how such things and be overlooked with a thorough cleaning. What else is being overlooked that we don't notice.    This was our first time here so I don't know if this is the typical standard level of cleaning or not. But it is not acceptable. The"
40,They don‚Äôt tell you until you check in that there is no housekeeping during your stay. If you want fresh towels etc just call. Well I call 3 times and finally found a plastic bag outside my door in am. They have a text system to request items but only found out about that on their tv channel. If you don‚Äôt watch tv or even pay attention to their channel you wouldn‚Äôt know. That did work much better! Hard to get drink on the casino floor & bartenders have a hard time hearing or understanding with masks on. Pool is a joke. Line starts to form at least an hour early. Long lines down hall even at noon! I was impressed with Valet. They wipe down your car before you get in. Good job! Tip them! Forum shops were closed off to enter until 11 am for all you morning walkers. Cheesecake Factory took Sunday morning reservations starting at 10 am. Good job can‚Äôt get there! Thank goodness a security officer let us in to get there. Many places not open yet or have reduced hours. Making reservations to eat is a must!!!
40,Glitzy and bold look at this hotel. It delivers on the Las Vegas experience and is safe and clean. Restaurants didn‚Äôt interest us so we went to Bellagio for a nice meal and ambiance. Got to get my 200 letters in so here‚Äôs more: staff were great gambling fun and good overpriced (but that‚Äôs true everywhere in Las Vegas).
50,They always provide me with the right answer!!  They have outstanding rooms....  Good people and employees!  Use ‚Äúivy‚Äù the text messenger they give you all the right answers. They had whirlpool in the big bathrooms!
10,We checked into our room at Caesars and usually have a really pleasant experience. Thinking thing would be extra clean with covid and all but man was I wrong! We walked into a room with blood stain sheets! How do you miss that huge stain! By the location of the sheet we are guessing that time of the month blood... we are disgusted. We stay at Caesars properties exclusively. Make me would how the M life property's cleaning standards are. Better or worse?
20,"Decided to do a little ""stay-cation"" here.  My reservation was for 2 nights but I only stayed 1. It was my first time ever staying at Caesar's and with the legendary name I was expecting the best but got maybe an ""ok""  Self parking was easy. At the front desk I decided to try the self check-in kiosks... I got a message saying contact a floor agent. The bald guy who came over wasn't very helpful or friendly and just said try again!  I got the error message again so I went to the real person check-in line. While waiting in line I witnessed other people having issues at the self check-in kiosks and when an agent came to help them they took the guest right to the counter agent where they finished checking them in... therefore skipping EVERYONE waiting! Do you see the problem here. I saw this happen 3 times. (But I wasn't offered this first class service)    I get to my room in the Octavius tower not bad pretty good view of the pool spacious. Now here is the list of things wrong...  - No Covid-19 seal on the door (but I saw this on many other doors)  - The front door has to be shoved to open and didn't shut without yanking it hard  - A used coaster in the sink  - A couple long black hairs on top of the bath towels (didn't touch them)  - The shower door makes this super loud popping sound scared me every time  - Cigarette smoke smell came into my room a couple times gross!!    In the casino there were some friendly servers Tracy at one casino bar was great. A couple others no so much.  I called about the problems with my room all she said was ""I'll let them know"". (Let who know no apologies)  The last straw was at the end of my convo with the guest services agent I said ""ehhh I might just leave after 1 night"" she said there would be a early  check out FEE if I did that and it would end up costing more that the next day's resort fee.  So I said screw it i'll just leave... they already got me for $500 lost in the casino. I left about 11am the next morning and the cigarette smoke was back!    The shining star was that I had the 3rd best Mac'n'cheese I ever had at their steakhouse and the staff and service there were great!    I will probably NOT be staying there again anytime soon :)"
10,We booked a one bedroom king suite for 5 nights. When we checked in we asked for a two bedroom since its our wedding anniversary some family members and friends came with us that's why we need a two bedroom. So were offered a suite which is suppossed to be an upgrade but when we got in to the room there's only one bedroom and a living room. What a bummer! So we called the front desk and they said there's an adjacent room which is available cleaned and ready for occupancy but we just have to pay the resort fee. So we got the room. We were so tired from an eight hour drive so we just want to rest. But the following day we found out there was a used condom on the side of the bed. Yuck! And we also found a refrigerator in the closet which according to the hotel staff no refrigerator in every room due to Covid19. Meaning to say the room was not cleaned and sanitized! They just put a red sticker by the door saying it was cleaned and sanitized for your safety but the truth of the matter is it was not! This is very unacceptable! The hotel is putting their guests in danger especially the room was not sanitized. Covid19 might be lurking around the room. Very dangerous! Management must do something about this and talk to their housekeeping to address this issue. We were very disappointed!
30,Furniture looked terrible and so old. The chest was like a thrift store find. Horrible worn purple chair. The mattress was very good and the bathroom was okay.  To be such a nice hotel the room decor was awful. Forum 6403
10,Came here at the end of a road trip from Lake Tahoe and stayed 1 1/2 days before flying out of Vegas. Everything in this hotel is overpriced and of marginal quality and can‚Äôt even get a complimentary cup of coffee in the morning. Have to go to Starbucks where a medium coffee is over $5. Even the food court dinners are $20+ and your order won‚Äôt be right. Couldn‚Äôt get in the pool tried twice and yet a ‚Äúresort fee‚Äù was on my bill. The whole place is designed to rip you off even if you‚Äôre not gambling. The service people are very nice and polite while saying no to your every request. Beers are $12 plus a tip and the old days of free drinks while gambling are long gone.  Atmosphere? Terrible. It feels like a cattle drive except we‚Äôre all suckers and Caesars doesn‚Äôt even pretend we‚Äôre not anymore.  Stay away.
50,This past 4th of July close friends of ours were getting married just outside the strip. So like I always my wife & I stayed at Caesars Palace. We were of course a bit apprehensive with the covid 19. I'm here to tell you from the moment we step into Caesars they had you covered with offering mask hand sanitizer. Some of changes they have made is no mini bar in room no room service no maid service but just ask them if you need something they will take care of it. 3 people to a table if you play black jack. and every other slot machine if there is 2 slots open side by side only someone you know will they let sit with you. Not all restaurants are open. Taking everything into consideration everyone from the clerk when you check in to the dealers and hosts they do there best to make sure you are comfortable having fun and most of all staying safe. To everyone at Caesars Palace looking forward to our next visit and Thank you
30,As of writing this i have to say I do reside in Las Vegas. During the Covid pandemic I just wanted to do a little getaway without going too crazy so I did book a stay here.    PROS.    > Very affordable for what you're getting  > Modern furnishings  > Great spacious bathrooms  > Staff is very helpful and friendly    CONS    > No jacuzzi in the pool area  > Pool closes at 6PM (REALLY! So if you check-in at 4PM you have to rush to get some pool time it's really upsetting ...)  > They are not friendly towards food delivery personnel I have many issues with Uber drivers saying staff told them they had to park the car in the garage just to drop food off at the lobby. You'd think they would be more understanding since most of their restaurants are closed.    All in all pre-covid it was great but now I am leaning towards better stays. The pool closing before sundown in las vegas is pretty ridiculous and if anything makes things worse since instead of social distancing everyone will have to crowd up around the tight pool schedule.
20,Let me begin by saying this is my favorite hotel on the strip. So this was my first trip back since they have re-opened. I had been warned by several other 7 Stars Players that they would not be returning anytime soon. First off besides the special Valet 7 Stars basically means nothing anymore. I will breakdown our trip.  1. Upon Check in I had a confirmed reservation for two twin beds in the Augusta Tower and My offer code with Free Play. I was smart enough to bring copies of both. First they tell me the Augusta Tower is sold out and want to put me in a lesser tower but they do have a Big Suit available for an extra $275 per night. I then proceed to explain to them by the 7 star rules we get upgraded free to the next best available room . (Which I have never seen this actually be the case) They of coarse called someone and said no. Then I asked to talk to a manager. Then miraculously they found a two queen beed room in the Augusta Tower. Then I asked about me Free Play offer. They said they have no recored of it. Yet again I I came prepared and showed them the offer code in which I booked. They said they could not help me and sent me to the Total Awards booth. Now here is the kicker. There is no longer 7 Stars lines. The have been combined with Diamond. So I had to wait over a half hour. I finally get up to the the Rewards booth and everyone is nice I even know some of them. I show them the offer code and then they explain they can't help me I need to go to a onsite host but there no onsite host right now due to Covid. So now I have wasted about an hour of my time trying to check in and get my free play even though I have copies of both with me. I finally called my host and she was able to take care of it. The biggest reason we love Ceasars is the Laural Lounge. Its where we made so many great friends and also the staff including Richard and Rick make the trip fun. I knew this was closed and have to say it really takes away from the trip not having that bar and its staff to visit. Gambling also was not as fun. If you sat at the bar with you wife and friends you where so spaced out you couldn't talk. Then why playing Black Jack at Harrahs my wife was staying about two feet behind me and a dealer from two tables over yells across at her to stand farther back. First of all our own dealer could of said this not some rude dealer two table away. My wife steps back farther and the dealer still yells for her to step back farther. It was really quite a scene.
10,The worst time I've had a Caesars due to having to wear a mask the whole time. Even when at a bar having a drink we were being told to pull your mask back up after each sip. Most ridiculous policy I've ever heard. I had to touch my mask over a hundred times each day which is even worse when trying to avoid germs. So inconvenient that we left the property early. Property may as well stayed closed. Even when outside at the pool area we were constantly hounded to wear our masks.
30,The resort is beautiful. The rooms and grounds are exceptional. However this place is way overpriced and will nickel and dime you to death . $50 a day resort fee $78 for two basic breakfast plates and two orange juices $60 per person per day to use the adult pool is outrageous! $27 for a mixed drink and $50 for a bucket of beer( we paid $105 for 12beers!! We pay $50 a day for resort fee so that adult pool should be no charge! We went to another pool club one day and got in free !! Love the hotel and staff was decent( not great) but will stay somewhere else next time because of all the fees
50,I felt very safe at this hotel. The rooms and facility were spotless. My only complaint was having to pay and extra $50 to check in before 4pm. Seems like a very unnecessary expense since there were SO many vacant rooms.
50,Caesar's was always on my bucket list. My mom was in ICU at local hospital and I needed to go. Hotel.com showed me a room that was in my budget and i was upgraded. Simply AMAZING! All i can say. It exceeded my expectations. And everyone was intent on making my visit just that. Thank you!
40,Our room  Exceeded our expectations The cleanliness of the property Was excellent The front desk was helpful and knowledgeable Our host was also helpful I would advise stand in that Augustus tower Or the octavius tower.
10,I have worked in New York City hospitality and tourism my entire career and I have dealt with many customer issues during my time. I definitely would have handled this situation differently if I was behind the desk.    Once going to the hotel registration we paid for early check-in and went all the way back to the car to grab our belongings. Finally once we made it to our hotel room (almost 45 minutes since checking in) it was very apparent the room had not been touched since the last guest ‚Äî reminder this is during a pandemic. Dirty towels everywhere half empty drinks used Q-tips everything but the previous guest‚Äôs luggage. We made a call to the front desk and they said we‚Äôd have to come back down to hotel registration to speak to someone about our issue and to not leave our belongings in the dirty room (as they didn‚Äôt know if the previous guest still had access to the room).    They promptly gave us a new room and a $35 food and beverage credit for Caesar Palace owned restaurants only (so this excludes many of the restaurants within the casino). A nice action but we had paid an additional $50 to get early access as well as the $50 resort fee (covers Wi-Fi for only two devices and pool access). This is $100 on top of the $325+ room.    Upon talking to them further they bumped it up to a $50 F&B credit. They said it was ‚Äúthe most they could offer.‚Äù So I guess thanks for the $50 back and some potential COVID-19 contamination.    Every clean room on the floor had a ‚Äúcleaned and sealed for your protection‚Äù stating that the room was properly disinfected after the previous guest and sealed off until the next person‚Äôs arrival. Our second room (and first obviously) did not. We also had multiple lights out in the bathroom. When we called guest services again they said they‚Äôd send an engineer up and it would hopefully take no more than 15minutes; it took an hour.    So all in all not the worst experience. But yeah sure stay here if you want to pay $300+ for a $150 room in a themed hotel in the middle of the strip. But I‚Äôd recommend the Wynn Encore with their exceptional guest service team.    Lastly when it says ‚ÄúMountain View‚Äù it really means view of the adjacent building‚Äôs roof.
50,"We needed a get away after they ""Stay out home"" orders we lifted. We normally cruise in the summer or visit back east. But with lock downs and other restrictions in place we choose to go to Las Vegas and stay at Caesars Palace. We upgraded to a suite and so glad we did. It was wonderful. After the first night I commented to my wife ""That's a long walk to the bathroom during the night."" First world problem. I figured they would be safety conscious and they we even above my expectations. From the temperature checks free masks dispensers were numerous sanitizer stations were everywhere. Social distancing was enforced in the casino and especially at the pools. Loungers were zipped tied together and spaced apart with a certain allowed into the pool area at a time. I missed playing poker as the Poker Room is open Thurs-Sunday and we were there Mon-Thursday. Other than that it was an awesome experience."
10,Ok so when we arrive everything was fine until we got the (air quote) newly renovated room...the room had a horrible smell carpet had burn holes bathroom door was broken and looks like it was cleaned with egg drop soup (I have videos and pictures so no I‚Äôm not exaggerating).    They were extremely reluctant to give us another room until we said we had pictures and video then their attitude changed!    We are being charged full price (they say discount but that's not true I researched it) but no maid service. I understand the being cautious because of the COVID pandemic but you can still provide service cautiously!    The new room was no better however the smell was gone. The shower handle was broken drawer broken the new towel they sent had a huge orange stain on it (gross)!!!    The cell reception in the room was so bad it forced you to purchase (yes I said purchase) their WiFi. It seems like they have a scrambler to scramble your reception so they can nickle and dime you!!!    Was going to spend 10 days here but will be going to another hotel 4 days early!    When items get missing from my room that is the last straw. When we checked out Fabian at customer service after I said that I‚Äôve already put the pictures on yelp he said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs fine Bit_h‚Äù under his breath. I was being nice and courteous the entire time. I didn‚Äôt ask for anything but to be treated fairly. Thank God I recorded the entire transaction!    So TripAdvisor isn‚Äôt allowing me to post the pictures?!!!!! That‚Äôs ok
20,Caesars is very dated. Rooms were dated furniture was scratched and scuffed. We had to move rooms because the toilet didnt work TVs didnt work and electric shades didnt work. Overall cleanliness of the hotel was poor as well.
10,My sister and I went there to escape our nursing jobs on our postponed vacation to celebrate her birthday- we had originally planned to go end of March.  Given the circumstances- you‚Äôd think they would roll out the red carpets for the few that are coming against all odds - either stay consistent and not decrease value of winning or at least be nice to your guests.  The workers were all pissed they had to come back to work for less than their unemployment stimulus checks as we heard them exclaiming as much. Waitress pushed a water into my sisters chest after she had ignored her asking for one like 5 times and kept dodging her and ignoring her request for a water (with our tip in hand ) - she was just angry about working.  The manager was worse when we described what happened - she scolded my sister and told her not to shove the water at her bc she thought she was offended that my sister touched her and said ‚Äúdo you understand lady?! Understand me! ‚Äú and then she walked off and did nothing to the waitress. I told the host of my Caesar platinum management of the trip and nothing was done - not even a complete of the resort charge - nothing .  We blew through several thousand we had saved to go and enjoy ourselves ‚Äî we noticed ‚Äîas did many patrons we spoke with ‚Äî the bonuses that came on max bet only paid $20 or so - rarely matched your bet. How selfish- we know you lost money but we have vowed not to return to Vegas - we can just play online chumba and get far better treatment and odds .  They had a security officer like a prison taking my temperature (only time it was taken) when I asked at checkout for her to remove $150 of mini bar charges we didn‚Äôt make because - hello- the mini bar is empty due to covid! She said how do I know you didn‚Äôt make the charges to mini bar and you‚Äôll have to get your temperature checked over there before I‚Äôll remove it.  Save yourself the trouble of going ! There‚Äôs no appreciation of Vegas veterans or others - just throw your money away and get treated like you‚Äôre at a Walmart somewhere else. No resort treatment - no smiles - no friendly service and no follow up!
50,I just needed a break from my daily routine. Slots not paying at all. Everything else was excellent. Last time I checked it was exhausting. I called and complained about the reservation clerk. She was so rude and pretending that the only rooms available were on the Julius tower. I called my casino host right in front of her who said the hotel wasn‚Äôt full. This time I began with a requested a room on the Augustus tower close to the elevators. The clerk (Zandra) first said there would be an additional charge. This I didn‚Äôt understand since the room was comped. I explained that it was really hard for me to do a lot of walking. She relented and gave me what I wanted without any problems. Caesars should take into consideration a person‚Äôs age and physical status.
50,Great property with great restaurants and shopping. Great location on the strip. Enough to do that you don't have to leave the property but is so close to other hotels it allows you to check out the other options. Spent a fun day at the pool.
50,I loved the hotel and the place was super nice!! Plus the staff at Ceasers Palace were more than helpful to give us the room we wanted!!! The rooms were clean and the bed felt fantastic!! Just a great experience over all!!
40,Positive items during our stay: room was ready when we arrived cleanliness was excellent throughout the complex gambling machines were in very good condition security was very evident good visuals and enforcement regarding masks and social distancing good location  Negatives: The negatives were generally related to customer service and information accuracy. Several restaurants were closed that were listed as open on the website most people could not answer questions accurately (they cited frequent changes as the most common excuse) service at the Americano Grill was lousy (in fact we ended up eating most of our meals at Paris) the casino was extremely cold (evidently the air conditioning was still being adjusted) no casino host greeted us throughout our 5 day stay (even though when we did some gambling at the Paris Hotel during this trip their casino host greeted us and even sent us a follow-up e-mail) when we approached the Caesar's casino hosts with questions on two occasions they were rude and off-putting - even argumentative. One said he wasn't our host - even though he was the only one in the room that we could talk to at that time (although he did finally answer our question).  Caesars is a nice hotel - but the customer service aspect needs to be addressed.
50,Our room was very nice although we missed the amenities that were removed due to coronavirus :-(. The food in the cafe was not up to usual standards which is why i rated the value a little lower. the staff was very accomodating.
10,Hotel room had foul stuffy odor. Furniture was old and dingy. There was a ball of hair in the shower and room was not cleaned the whole weekend. Had high expectations due to cost and since it‚Äôs Cesars Palace but was totally disappointed. Will never stay here again.
10,We come to Vegas every year and nothing against Caesars but I would highly recommend anyone with vacations scheduled to cancel . The new covid 19 Vegas isn‚Äôt worth the money . U can‚Äôt get in the pools on some days cause they decide max capacity is 100 people . Mask are mandatory everywhere even outside walking down the side walk . So if you‚Äôre like me and don‚Äôt enjoy being told at dinner to put your mask on in between bites  or being told to put your mask on every time you have a drink of your beer I would recommend canceling your Las Vegas vacation . We would of but didn‚Äôt find out about the new restrictions till we got here .
50,Daniel at the registration was very friendly and serviceable. He made us feel welcome.  Nicole the hostess at the slot machine was super friendly she made us feel comfortable and welcome. Nicole has a great personality she is very friendly and serviceable. Please thank Daniel & Nicole for us. GREAT JOB
50,We we here too meet Our Daughters who traveled from San Fran Ca and Atlanta Georgia!!!! We Had a Great Family Reunion and an Excellent Time at Caesar‚Äôs Palace!!!!!üëçüèæüôãüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  We Would Love Too All Meet Here Again For Thanksgiving or Christmas so We Can All Be Together & Have a Great Time Againüëçüèæüôãüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòå
40,The staff at Caesars is as wonderful as can be! I was first greeted by Thomas and Terry the VIP valets. I must say that are not two better guys anywhere to be the first ones to great your guests. These guys set the tone for the customers coming in and they are great.  Then ones proceeds to the VIP check-in where they are greeted by the likes of Michelle (the New Zealand lady) Jay Sue Susan or any of the other staff (I forgot the gentlemen's name that checked me in whom was great) and now you are feeling great. This is single handed the BEST welcoming committee ever put together! Not sure if Michelle Worley gets to take a bow here or not but if she put this team together she should!  In my opinion the only way to make the check in process better would be bring back the concierges. The focal point of all current openings and goings on. The concierges are in fact a one stop shop of current information where ever one travels. It would be great to have them back!  My room was great. It was clean and quiet. The bed was great.  The post Covid changes that I saw were;  No refridgerators in the rooms  No room service  No mini bar  No snacks in the room  No house keeping  No room service  No coffee pots or coffee in the room. You have to leave to get coffee in the AM.  The spa is closed but you can get services  No bottled water at the valet check in or in the rooms. It is gone.  No Concierges  Laurel lounge is closed  Not all restaurants are open.  Not all shops are open.  Some pools are open not sure if all pools are open.  Night clubs are not open.  Concerts and shows are not running at this time.  Buffets are closed.    This is just what I noticed.    And numerous other changes all due to the Covid restrictions. The staff and hotel are doing their best given the restrictions they are working under.
50,We stayed at Caesars for the reopening and it was wonderful. From the moment we stepped out of the cab the door person greeted us with a warm welcome and a smile. Yes he was wearing a mask but you could feel the smile on his face. Our check in was smooth and a terrific experience due to the front desk agent Fabian. He followed all the necessary precautions without making us feel uncomfortable. He was welcoming friendly while still remaining extremely professional. He took the time to explain everything and what was open and happening in the hotel. When we arrived in our room we knew Fabian had done right by us. We were so happy that we returned to the desk to inquire about rates to stay an additional night and once again Fabian had all the answers. The casino floor was tons of fun and very clean. The food and beverage outlets were very enjoyable. There are enough options and having a Starbucks open always makes me happy. Caesars palace as always did not disappoint. We enjoyed ourselves so much we returned a few weeks later to stay a couple of nights with the same great experience...and we just booked another stay! Caesars is back!
20,Stayed at Caesars Palace for my daughter‚Äòs 21st birthday on the night of June 24th. Got a cabana which cost $250. Cabana TV screen was filthy and the overall cabana was very dirty. Service was extremely slow. Had to pay $55 for an early check in fee even though the hotel wasn‚Äôt even close to capacity. Paid a $50 resort fee. Not sure what you‚Äôre getting by paying the resort fee. Waited 20 minutes to check in. Only 2 people working the check-in desk. Couldn‚Äôt watch someone in your family gamble because they didn‚Äôt want you near the table. Overall experience was terrible. They are nickel and diming people to death. Not enough employees working. I‚Äôve been staying at Caesar‚Äôs for over 20 years. Unfortunately I‚Äôm going to switch over to the MGM properties.
50,We stayed at Caesars Palace for our anniversary. Checking in/out was surprisingly quick. Our room was very nice. We enjoyed playing in the casino and wandering through the shops. The pool was great. The staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful. With the covid 19 going on they were handing out masks and cleaning. They did a great job of mitigating concerns.
20,I went to Ceasars as a kid. The wow factor is definitely gone. We called twice for room service room cleaning NON EXISTENT. Go to the pool most of it is don't enter till you pay more. No place has breakfast. Most things are closed. Room was underwhelming. Not staying here again.
20,The first night I was there I saw a large roach in my room. I called and was told I needed to go down to registration. I went down to registration waited in line for 30+ min. to complain. They did switch my room to a similar room. I had to spend my vacation time waiting in line packing up my stuff and move myself. I should have made the call been assisted on the phone so I didn‚Äôt have to waste my time standing in a line a bell hop be sent to my room to assist me in moving and I should have received some compensation. I was very disappointed and will consider this prior to booking any other vacation at Vegas.
50,Had such a great time! We are rewards members and they upgraded us and we had a great room. Service was amazing from check in to security to restaurants. We hardly left the resort as they had everything we needed. Can‚Äôt wait to go back!
40,Had a wonderful time back in LV. Certainly some positives and negatives but for the most part it was great!! If you get a cabana at the venus pool- which is a must in this heat ask for Catherine she was fantastic!! Waited on us both days!!  Had a great dinner at the Palm Restaurant which was good. Also ate at the Mesa Grill which was really good and even better because of James...a GREAT waiter- ask for him!!  Been going to Vegas forever Diamond Plus member but stopping by the total rewards desk and chatting with Ivan saved me hundreds when he pointed out all the advantages of the card!! Well worth a short wait in line. Hoping that they honor the 5X deal- that will be nice.  The only negatives are probably things that they can't help- masks are a pain that's for sure- but better safe than sorry. Not cleaning rooms is really dumb in my opinion- 4 days without someone changing a sheet taking out trash bringing towels is a bit too much. Also they removed coffee machines in the room?? How does that help?  back to the positives...taxi/limos are awesome when no one is out there- take routes that show you everything and so inexpensive since there's no traffic! Super cool. Hopefully they will get everything back to normal soon but until then this is a GREAT time to visit Vegas if you want to gamble and hit the pool and restaurants.  Scotty
50,It‚Äôs very beautiful. Expect to spend alot on food. I would definitely recommend this Hotel.plenty of restaurants to choose from. They have the finest shopping stores in the world at your fingertips. Please come see for yourselves. Unbelievable!
10,So it was nice to see all the precautions they listed they would do during Covid to keep guests safely their website.    But it did not show hand sanitizer to the main parking area elevators that everyone had to use was always out.    My room was dirty trash was on the floor. There was pee on the toilet seat. And one of the glasses had a dirty fingerprint on it.    Now they even had these special stickers saying they went through and did extra care. The stickers were useless. The room was dirty by regular standards.    Guest services were apologetic. Now the front desk manager and front desk person were not pleasant nor did either apologize. I had another billing issue and seemed to have irritated them to the point when I showed her the pictures of the dirty room she didn‚Äôt say anything except I‚Äôll take off the resort fees. I wouldn‚Äôt have mind paying it if I would have been simply apologized to. And when I told her I used my bleach wipes she says ‚Äúoh that should be good then or do you want a maid to come clean?‚Äù    I have looked forward to staying at Caesars since I was a kid. And I will not be setting a foot inside anymore of their properties. Its disappointing.
30,We stayed 5 nights and overall the room was comfortable. We upgraded from the Forum Tower to the Palace Tower. It was a little disappointing because there were a few broken items like the drains on both sinks and the tub mechanism was also broken. The rooms are definitely starting to show their age. The jetted tub worked but it definitely needed to be re- caulked. Not sure if it was any better than a Forum room. The $45 a night resort fee is too high. I guess they can get it for the nicer properties but even $30 is too high. Ceazars Palace is a good location but I‚Äôm not sure it is worth the extra expense.
30,I understand that this time is almost impossible trying to balance business and safety. That‚Äôs why I put average instead of below average.  The last two times I‚Äôve stayed at Ceasars Palace (not Ceasars properties) they have added bogus charges to my bill they fixed it but still. Most stuff isn‚Äôt open the employees are not in their regular areas and complain about it and have no idea what is open or hours of operation of restaurants etc. inconsistent on comped drinks and after a five night stay casino host wouldn‚Äôt even comp a meal. I will stay at other Ceasars properties but never at the palace again
20,Window view blocked.Heavy smell of cigarette coming from the AC vents (seemed)broke(keep in mind I got the non smoking suite).The L shape couch had Dog hair and carpet was dirty.Leaking faucet.no usb.
10,This was a terrible experience. I‚Äôm a poker player and the poker Room wasn‚Äôt open the first two nights of my stay briefly the third and 4th nights. Having lost 10-12000 on BJ you‚Äôd think that my convenience store purchases of Pepsi and water would have been comped they weren‚Äôt. Nor was my 5shot order of tequila for $90+. My internet WiFi password cost me $15/day also bit comped while services were almost non existent. No fresh towels or linens no fresh bottles of water in the nightstand nor anything avaiable in the mini fridge... Just a horrible experience where I was buckle and dimed throughout my stay.
30,First stay at Caesar‚Äôs normally stay flamingo or MGM. MLife gold status match declined so $52/ day resort fee charged. Casino employees had no clue what was open and social distancing not followed. Save your money and go elsewhere. Since Caesar‚Äôs raises status matches in 2020 now I will be converting to MLife exclusively
40,Stayed in the octavius tower which was a comped room. 3 nights just resort fees which was 51.00 dollars per night. Stayed on the 53rd floor facing the pool and it was really nice.    Firstly it‚Äôs Las Vegas many partygoers come and go and the rooms are not perfect a couple chips and dings here and there but I believe everyone should expect that at any casino or resort unless your paying the big bucks for a fancy high class upgrade.    It was nice beautiful view of pool and having gone 4 years in a row this was our first time staying at C.P. Previously Marriott grand chateau Paris and Cromwell. I liked Paris my wife liked Marriot (more family oriented no casino) my mom like Caesars and although Cromwell is nice its not so much for a family as it has darker rooms and less window for sight seeing.    Octavius tower is toward the rear so a lot of extra walking is required. Also 53rd floor might seem like its high but I believe the elevator starts at 50 or 51 so it‚Äôs the lower level yet your still pretty high up.    Gambling wise it‚Äôs a more classy hotel. Pretty quiet at the table games. No loud music in the background and waitresses were pretty slow. Overall for hotel purposes it‚Äôs wonderful and as a slot player it‚Äôs also wonderful but if your a table player its a lot funner at other casinos with live bands dancing sexy girls and outdoor vibe which casinos right across the street offer.    Going again this September and yep we are staying here again Mom is the boss.
30,Besides restaurant the entire resort can surely do better amid covid. They only check temperature once upon check in to the hotel. They don't let my spouse stand behind me on a table games although we share the same bed at the room. This doesn't make sense as they don't monitor any other areas such as casino slot floor entrances and elevators. They aren't requiring mask in side the facility but only on playing table. Also a player has been playing with me on table was asked to put on his mask back after a split seconds for him to sip on his drinks and when this happened the dealer then asked for the player ID as he looks young. Then the player argues I've been here for 2 hours aren't you guys supposed to check my ID before I sit down? this is all happening while a good crowd walking pass by us without any facial covering. Again no one is inspecting the slot area floor for this. we left early and only stayed a day and half. Very uncomfortable visit.
20,"Caesars Palace is THE ICONIC luxury Las Vegas property with nearly 60 years of history featuring Roman architecture backdrop for 12+ movies the most opulent pools in Las Vegas and known for providing excellent hospitality for guests. We are  visiting every time we get a chance for the past 20 years.    Caesars is not ready for prime time.    My husband and I have worked all the way through the pandemic. I‚Äôve not had one day off this year and we were so looking forward to rest and relaxation for out 20th Anniversary.    Casino floor waitresses & staff pool waitresses as well as restaurant staff seem genuinely grateful for customers returning after being shut down due to Covid-19 pandemic. Majority of employees are friendly hard working but the venue is understaffed.    Caesars is open but doesn't practice consistent safety and well being protocols to make it a safe environment for guests & employees. The casino and pool aren‚Äôt throughly clean nor consistently immaculately disinfected if there are protocols for consistent & systematic cleaning and disinfection they are not being followed perhaps because the property is understaffed?    By evening 3 of our trip machines could be seen with 3 and more half spent drink glasses and full ashtrays piled on machines & some patrons moving the refuge and cleaning machines themselves. The casino floor cleaners and waitresses were trying but could not keep up as they were understaffed and far too many patrons were allowed on the casino floor making social distancing impossible.    Where is the dedicated signage offering guests and patrons face coverage where are the washing stations? There are a few large wipes dispensing jars but they are far and few between and no signs lead to them.    Prior to booking informed by reservations that Octavius Tower is the newest tower with the nicest rooms however although the newest it‚Äôs nearly a decade old never updated & has obstructed views. Our room is dirty stained rather beat up TV in bathroom hanging sideways and dirty dusty and inoperable. The bathroom has the scent of mildew mixed with maybe afternoon morgue no maid service refrigerator removed in-room snacks/fridge removed coffee maker removed vending machines removed from halls dirty dusty room with dusty dingy smelly bathroom. I cleaned as best I could (what everyone wants to do on vacation) Property Manager: Nathan Byers (Hotel Revenue/Yield Optimization Manager Hotel Operations Manager) couldn‚Äôt/wouldn‚Äôt move us to a room with a strip or mountain view or another tower even though it is our 20th Wedding Anniversary and we are frequent guests (20 years).    The room we were told would be fabulous with a beautiful view has no view no maid service and waited 3 days for a change of towels. The room is uncomfortable with only one chair and a dirty stained sofa where we dare not sit. Guests next door behaved as though they had never been in a hotel much less a luxury property and loudly partied day and night waking us at all hours even though we called the front desk. We came home from this ‚Äúvacation‚Äù exhausted and I'm ill.    The first night Casino is relatively clean sans floor and just about every other machine turned off for social distancing and they were regularly cleaned by night two very few machines turned off and rarely cleaned between customers no social distancing enforced the casino is a crowded madhouse and night 4 until the end the Casino is as nasty as I‚Äôve ever seen few if any machines turned off for social distancing and some had as many as 4 full ashtrays and several used glasses pilled up on them.    Pool is overcrowded ice cold nasty and miserable.    There is no such thing as a totally free room resort fees with tax are over $50 daily for basically nothing a few little things that most people aren't going to use that SHOULD be included at any luxury resort. Embarrassed for you!    And with so many amenities shut down Caesars is still charging an absurd ‚Äúresort fee‚Äù of $45 + tax PER NIGHT  And since Las Vegas Strip hotels now have a 13.38% tax rate your nightly resort fee will be about $51.02 after tax. This covers all local calls access for two guests to the health club and in room high-speed internet. Who makes local calls anymore from a land line? The ‚Äúhealth club‚Äù is largely stripped due to Covid19 (management excuse for everything) and go to any local Starbucks for Internet or use your phone like most people. The corporation knows this is a charge that is worthless to customers:    **********In an interview August 5 2019 during it‚Äôs second-quarter earnings call Caesars Palace CEO Tony Radio said ‚ÄúOver time at some point there‚Äôs going to be the straw that breaks the camel‚Äôs back‚Äù Rodio said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre there yet but I want us to be very judicious and cautious about taking those rates any further. It‚Äôs certainly a revenue stream that‚Äôs hard to walk away from and it‚Äôs been accepted at this point but we‚Äôre getting pretty high.‚Äù      DETAILS    Hotel Room:    Octavius Tower (behind Augustus Tower)  Dates: June 10-15 2020  Built nearly a decade ago  Opened January 2012 and not since updated  Erroneously told EVERY ROOM IN Octavius Tower is more upscale luxurious offering better service and views.  Requested strip View  There are no strip views views obstructed  Our view is a Side of Bellagio and the street (No strip nor mountain view)    Requested strip view on highest possible floor for our 20th anniversary far in advance of trip. Encouraged to checkin online and kiosk upon arrival (‚Äúbecause of Covid-19 the excuse for every problem at Caesars PLACE‚Äù) kiosk apparently defaults to a garbage room.    After speaking with several people (front desk call center host center) my husband  Requests call center transfer him to casino marketing. They declined said  casino marketing could not do anything that front desk could not do.    My husband walks all the way from our room to the casino host center asks one of the hosts to please change us into a room as requested explains we have patronized hotel & casino for 20 years thesis our 20th wedding anniversary she said she didn‚Äôt think so made a phone call that person she claims said no had pictures on his phone from a couple of years ago from Augustus tower (similar package) and she said ‚Äúsee you came two years ago one time and got spoiled by having such a nice room.‚Äù My husband told her we were married in Vegas 20 years ago and have been there every year since had all kinds of nice rooms suites packages we‚Äôre not ‚Äúspoiled‚Äù we‚Äôre 20 yr customers. Flippantly said you may try front desk.    Eventually the call center directed property manager Nathan Byers phone our room he explained we couldn‚Äôt change rooms because of Covid when my husband pointed out that front desk and call center said that we could change rooms for an additional $65-$90 + $45 + tax resort fee per night Mr. Byers explained that he isn't ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to move around rooms within the same room type.    When my husband mentioned that we were trying to get a descent strip view for our 20th anniversary as requested when making the initial reservation and that we would NOT have used online checkin or Kiosk as it is encouraged even shamed if you don‚Äôt want to use it because of Covid-19 if we knew that would mean we couldn‚Äôt change rooms if we were placed in a horror show (smelly room with broken bathroom TV nasty grout nasty sofa only one chair hasn‚Äôt been upgraded since built nearly a decade prior) as we were the property manager offered to move us to an even lower room on the pool side as though it were an upgrade of course some of those rooms also have obstructed view and it is down lower not higher as we had requested. Said he couldn‚Äôt change our room in the same reservation because of Covid but could if it were even closer to the ground? (because Covid doesn‚Äôt survive on lower floors?). That‚Äôs appreciation for 20 years as customers.    Perhaps if we had been allowed to speak with Casino marketing they could have done something to help us but no. I had more offers on my separate account and my husband had other offers but management is busy and dismissive.    Cleanliness:  During the Pandemic we expected cleanliness  Room is not clean bathroom has pungent smell perhaps of mildew & mold  TV in the bathroom hanging sideways non working dusty-dirty  There is no guest maid service during stay  Wait 3 days after ordering clean towels soap and trash pick up never delivered after using app and calling.  Found a maid and convinced her to allow us to have some clean towels.  Plumbing above our room runs loudly.  Shower has soap scum on tile in soap holder  Grout in the shower is gross as is the bathroom floor (majority of the  marble in the hotel dull with nasty grout)  The sofa in our hotel room has long large black stains and weird smell.  Only one chair in the room.  Neighbors loudly partying all night called front desk and either nothing is  done or request ignored they leave towels in the door so  their buddies come and go as they pleased.  There is no refrigerator coffee maker and no pay snack fridge.  Also all the vending machines are removed.    Room Amenities:    Air conditioning automatically jumps back up to 76 on it‚Äôs own or isn‚Äôt working well  But not uncomfortable  No Desk  No Minibar  No Room Service  No coffee maker  Only 1 day worth of toiletries 2 tiny soaps for entire stay  Nice Bedding but not changed  Bed (headboard is very damaged nasty and ugly)  Small in-room safe  Phone  No Housekeeping  Old Iron/ Ironing board (works well enough)  No Turndown Service    Internet: WiFi you pay for it if you want it or not and it‚Äôs only  For two devices    GARDEN OF THE GODS POOL OASIS    Large beautiful manicured pool area surrounded by roman architecture sculptures and numerous well appointed pools.    Seven pool experiences (8 pools) but really three for serfs. The remainder for the 1% celebrities those who have to gamble even while in the pool and those willing to pay hundreds for padded chairs beds and cabanas. Unlike the old days being even a year ago guests can look at the luxury but only the select as deemed by management experience Cives Romani everyone else ‚Äúenjoys"" quasi Latini.    Entry into the pool complex is complimentary for Caesars and Nobu hotel guests but not entry into the choice areas. Saved are the choice areas for those below-described means the Hotel can allow more people into the complex meeting Covid-19 restrictions but in reality most are huddled into a few areas. Once an opulent treat for all guests now reserved for the few and the huddled masses don‚Äôt have to worry about Covid-19?    Long wait in line supposedly due to of health and safety concerns for employees and guests in the wake of Covid-19 - social distancing - combat over crowding - let so many in after so many leave - right -    What a joke -    Less lounge chairs (""because Covid-19"") but tons of people.    The gorgeous Temple pool (the one with central fountains) is the only pool where it is possible to walk without stepping on someone or their belongings using their towel as a lounge chair. After a long wait we were able to obtain chairs chairs that were not wiped down from the last guest who laid in them with nasty wet towels still on them and trash (cups cans etc.) all around and under them - class and health right!    By the third day at Caesars garden of the gods June 13 2020 (so crowded after walking around for what seemed like a half hour couldn't find even one lounge chair nor a spot to place a towel to keep our belongings off the ground so we gave up and left) after making quite a show of having guests waiting in line six feet apart (social distancing) with employees watching and reminding patrons to only move as far as the next dot once in the pool area a snarky kid said only one towel (it's been 2 for 20 years) why? ""Can't get towels out fast enough"" This seemed odd because of Social distancing and only so many people allowed into the pool area at a time. Why is it so damned crowded?    It‚Äôs super crowded because most guest are crammed in and around Temple pool Apollo pool and kids and teens Jupiter pool    Temple Pool: Most of the adult guests are crammed in and around the Temple pool  Apollo Pool: Small area with people crammed in and around tiny pool area  Jupiter Pool: Small pool where the loud kiddos/teens play oversized games    The other 5 pools have far few ‚Äúguests‚Äù  Venus Pool: ‚Äúadult pool‚Äù  Neptune Pool: roped off for people paying hundreds for daybeds and cabanas  Fortuna Pool: Tiny pool/gaming area  Bacchus Pool(s) 2 pools in one exclusive area: Exclusive pool reserved for invited high rollers and celebrities    Thus Caesars squeaks by pool regulations regarding number of people in pool area but in reality only 3 of the pools are used by most of the guests.    ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Neptune pool roped off so for a 5 night stay for hundreds and hundreds more may rent a space (because covid-19 ???) Prior 19 years this area open to all guests and rentals were reasonable. Tons of space wasted just like all the other private areas where the corporation rakes in $$$. If it were worried about safety more space would be open not less. None of the pools would be private during the pandemic if safety were the issue.    ********** Don't get me wrong the waitresses do an excellent job they have nothing to do with the corporate issues that have ruined the pool experience.    To recap:  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Even during the pandemic the pools are crowded many areas private so the amount of people let in at a time doesn't mean expected safety because so much of the pool areas is private or rental only.    ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî The pools are cold as ice water.    ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî The pools have nasty slimy skim on top of the water.    ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî People packed in like sardines.    ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Chairs not being sanitized when one patron leaves and another takes the same chair. The bathroom is out of soap towels filthy overflowing with trash on the floor and water pooled and smells like hell.    ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî The garden of the gods has gone from being relaxing and 5 star worthy experience into the safety & opulence expected in an interstate do drop in motel pool.    **********.

10,On June 13th 2020 Paris Las Vegas Hotel and Casino was still closed due to the Covid-19 Pandemic so they have relocated our reservation to Caesars Palace Las Vegas. Honestly I expected more respect from the staff of the Caesars Palace. Our room in the Forum Tower was poorly prepared. A housekeeper was even too lazy to vacuum the floor in the room before our check-in. Otherwise they would have found a sock of a previous guest left in the room near a chair. But the most upsetting thing was that they continue to use sheets and comforters with holes and stains. This is disgusting and unacceptable!
20,We stayed in a traditional suite in the Forum Tower for 4 nights. It was very dated with chipped furniture broken drape mechanism and dust bunnies everywhere. What was really upsetting however was the failure by property management to enforce COVID-19 safety protocols. Temperatures were taken at check-in but that‚Äôs about it.  Most quests on the casino floor did not wear face coverings or maintain social distance. I was often bumped and jostled by large groups of twenty-somethings oblivious to keeping a safe distance. Signs by the elevators warned that no more than four should occupy a car. Several times groups of four five or more would crowd into a car after me....none wearing face coverings. All I could do was scramble to get out ( if I could) and wait for the next elevator....sometimes having to let two or three over crowded cars go by. Wait staff in The Americano Cafe touched my utensils and dishes without gloves and re-used paper menus. I hope I don‚Äôt get sick!
20,The forum tower is very old and smells like smoke. It looked like there was throw up all over the bathroom walls but the manager on duty informed me that the brown splatter is simply because that tower is old. Yuck! The Julius tower was much nicer. Rooms don't include a fridge to store water in.
40,This was my first time going to Vegas and when do I choose to go? Right during a pandemic of course. I live in New York so the thought of not sitting in my apartment for the umpteenth day in a row and actually going to a restaurant sounded like a great idea and I could have honestly been almost anywhere and I would have had a great time.  That being said I expected more. I probably would have gotten more had the timing been different. I should also mention I was there in the middle of the week. Maybe that‚Äôs why a lot of things weren‚Äôt open or seemed to have very limited hours. I was excited to try some restaurants that never opened. The spa-never opened. The club-never open. I can‚Äôt fault them for those things because it was like that at a lot of other hotels we went to.  So the pool is nice. Somehow the water was always ice cold maybe because your body temperature in the dessert is so hot but you‚Äôd think by late afternoon it would have warmed up. Maybe it did but the pool closes crazy early. The website said 6 but we went down at 4 and they were ‚Äúclosed‚Äù. So I thought fine I‚Äôll get a pi√±a colada at that bar in the front of the hotel. No. Closed. Even though it says 24 hours. I guess the inside portion of the bar is open still but if I‚Äôm going to sit inside and drink I might as well drink on the casino floor and not pay for it (but will wait 30 min for said drink). I ate at Hells Kitchen and wow. That place alone is worth a trip to Vegas but this review isn‚Äôt about that. What I can tell you is the room was decent. The shower was nice the bed was amazing but the place is so wildly outdated. There was a CD player in the room for crying out loud.  So now that I‚Äôve rambled on for a while the bottom line is-Just don‚Äôt expect a palace. The location is great. The forum shops are very nice. I‚Äôve never seen a spiral staircase escalator in my life or knew of their existence until I came here and they have several. The restaurants and bars that are open are great. The pools are great too just go early. And I personally liked the pools that were behind the main pool. It was less crowded and adults only. Eat at Hell‚Äôs Kitchen and Joes Stone Crab
30,Stayed 6/16 - 6/19  If you check in at the desk you need to go though a temperature scanner if you use the kiosk you just walk right up to to it and check in there are signs stating you need to be scanned but no enforcement at the Kiosk. Should be checks at the door like Wynn & Encore who check everyone entering the property and hand out masks if you need one. Table game minimums were way up $25 / $50 anytime of day or night never understood not wanting people to gamble when spots on tables are empty. Stayed here and gambled elsewhere guess I did gamble there with my safety. Harrahs Encore NY Paris all had reasonable table minimums for the strip. You can check in and out on your mobile device but no bluetooth keys so you still need to go to the kiosk. I know they are still trying to figure it all out and making daily tweaks. Room in Augustus tower was very nice AC didn't turn off in the middle of the night which is a HUGE plus in my book. The pool area was full the water freezing no umbrellas anywhere people were walking around with counters but if you can't find a chair what is there to count? Food service at the pool was lacking only pre made sandwiches in plastic boxes another work in progress I'm guessing.
30,Check in was quick. Staff were very courteous and helpful.  They were good with observing social distancing.  Pool area was clean.  Room was clean but was dated.  Rated it average for the room. Were were in a dated room. The cabinets were already peeling off and the bathroom sink was not draining properly.
10,"Don't stay at Caesars Palace expecting safety that has been advertised. There is a kiosk for check in - and there was no cleaning between people. There were no temperature checks unless you wanted to stand in a very slow line to talk to a representative. We booked a ""special"" at Paris and were moved to Ceasars. We were supposed to get a dining credit each day and only used it once on our check out day. We were told that the restaurant and bar IN THE LOBBY were not included. When I asked what was included - they said you should have gotten all of that information at check in. I didn't - and even stood in the 2 hour line to get a room close to my sister as the kiosks do not provide you with any options. So our $100 in dining credit was wasted - we had to pay $37 for terrible bloody mary's - and probably the worst part was they just didn't care. Their mistake this time. I won't make the mistake next time by staying there again - to be sure. The social distancing markers in the elevator said make sure to stay 6 ft apart - and were on the floor four feet apart. Weird place."
40,Our weeklong vacation began in a fantastic way! I initially had a complimentary reservation to stay at the Flamingo but my family members were all staying at Caesars. Wouldn't it be nicer to be able to spend your vacation with your family in the same hotel? So after explaining the situation Cameron (at the Diamond Registration desk) was tremendously helpful in transferring my weeklong complimentary stay at the Flamingo to the Augustus Tower. CAMERON rocks!    We were vacationing during the first weekend grand opening of the Strip following the coronavirus pandemic. My only gripe is that Caesars is not requiring guests to wear masks at all times. I appreciate that the casino employees are required to wear them but why not guests? In order to significantly curb the number of COVID-19 cases both employees and guests should be required to wear masks. Guests should also be required to bring hand sanitizer and sanitizer wipes in order to wipe down the slot machines the chairs the elevator buttons--anything and everything they touch! I witnessed plenty of ignorant guests going from one slot machine to another without masks and without sanitizing their germ-infested hands.
10,This is a joke!!!They specified to compliant and safe but when we got there they allowed people with no mask to get in all machine were not sanitized and open close proximity so people can stand and play. For Table game they do not sanitized the seat and the spot when players left I was asking the dealer and supervisor to clean before I sat down and they are very reluctant. They only check temperature at the check in line for the person who suppose to check in only and this line was surrounding around with people who do not wear mask. There were no security at all entrances to check and allow people to get in. No limit on capacity. Wont‚Äôt risk my life to come again. Ceasar Entertainment did not protect guests as they have advertised their property followed CDC guidelines. All they want to open and get as many people to coming in as possible. This is the worst preventive measures that I have seen.
20,We had reservations for Paris Hotel and were moved to Caesars Palace. We were put in a second class room the only view was a wall 10 ft away we couldn‚Äôt even see if the sun was shining. I called to complain and they told we they would get back with me never heard back. I will never stay there again.
10,We visited Caesars Palace recently after the re-opening during COVID 19. After we checked into the room we noticed there was no toilet paper in the bathroom so we had to ask the housekeeper to provide a few for us. During our stay we were looking forward to lounging and swimming in the pool but when we walked to the pool area not only was it overflowing with people but there was absolutely no more lounge chairs available. After walking around the pool for about 6 times and spent 25 min searching for chairs we decided to ask the pool attendant for help. She was nice but not helpful since she told us there's nothing they can do. We then decided to spread our towels on the ground and sit until one became available; it never did. We walked over to the pool and couldn't get in at all since the pool was at a freezing temperature. That water was so cold I couldn't get in at all and I was so disappointed. I also noticed no one was in the water. Later that night I wanted to call the front desk from my hotel room and noticed the phone wasn't working and it was dead. Overall my experience at Caesar's Palace was disappointing and very uncomfortable.
40,Beautiful property. Clean and well kept. Pleasant personnel unfortunately they lack training in how charge off the comped laurel lounge drinks and food. Daquan had the waitresses charge to the room and told us to have the front desk remove the charge. You guessed it no one seemed to have the authority or desire to get that done.
50,Yes only one complaint... There were no Ceasars Palace face masks. It woulda been one cool souvenir. The staff was great the room was spotless the drinks were strong and the casino took my money. What else can I say? It was a 5 star stay.
50,The Octavious tower is beautiful! Please keep in mind the casino/hotel has been closed for some time and with like any other company getting back into the swing of things takes a minute. A little patience and understanding will go a long way. With that being said YES they have removed the Keruig machines and snacks from the guest rooms. It may seem like an inconvenience but personally I think it's a great idea. They want to make sure everything you touch has been sanitized! I cannot tell you what if anything is in the mini fridge I am not a child and go around touching things I do not intend to use. It is baffling people complain about moving things & being charged. Rooms are cleaned & checked by a supervisor who then seals the room with a label. If anything does happen to come up reach out to Adam or Nathan (managers) they will make sure your concerns are addressed! Thanks for everything.
20,This was not the first visit here but by far the worst and therefore the last for the following reasons.  1. We were treated very badly by some extremely arrogant manager at the check in. There was not an inch of hospitality.  2. There are some strict regulations for guests at check in: temperature is measured with consequences - but o ly for guests at the check in counter - not for such who choose self check in or online check in. This is not consistent.  3. We booked a premium room - note rwally the cheapest !!!with strip view and got juat partly strip view on one of the first floors. So.it was just loud a d impossi me to sleep.  4. Most of the amanties like coffee maker have been removed without letting us know in advance - although a lot of inform to Covid strategies have been sent before arrival...  AND parts of the room were more dusty than ever before.    This is not anymore the place/palace to be
50,So we came here in March 2020 we are only staying the night we get there about 12pm and we check in but obviously the room isn't ready and we are early. So we leave our bags with the bell man and decide to go get lunch. So we ate too much and we decided to head back to Caesars and decide to walk for 15 min and wait our room to be ready well we hardly make it 10 min and decided we ate too much and lets try to get a room  it is now 2pm and we head to the are where they give us our room key lucky they allowed us to check in at 2 and get our room we got upgraded to augustus tower and it was immaculate clean huge room. We were treated so well from the start we had a text from a random number and it was Caesar's telling us we can communicate via text for anything we nee that helped a lot asked for extra towels and 20 min later 2 extra towels.. My only thing i didn't like was the mini bar which was stocked with drinks and snacks and is weighted so be careful not to touch that water and you will get charged but that was quickly taken care of so real issue there. all in all with the mini bar exception i still give it 5 stars. Beds were so comfy and the restroom was huge and clean toilet had its sep door. I will be back hopefully soon hope to stay in suite at some point for at least one night..
20,"We understand the difficulties of Covid. Perhaps Caesars should have stayed closed longer? Everything is blamed on Covid. Funny how it always seems to make money for Caesars....  Checked in online and used the kiosk for keys. Did not know we could not change our room for any reason. Would have done more to choose our room. Room was dirty. Neighbors were loud. No housekeeping. Requested towels. No towels came. Wanted a drink no vending machines. Walk half way across the entire property to the one store that is open. One person working check out. Pool is ice cold. Pool we've used every other time we've been there is now only for those who pay $200 per day for a day bed or more for a cabana. Much attention to standing in line 6 feet apart but masses flooded into the pool area and no social distancing. eGift Cards were supposed to be given for rewarding play. None have shown up. The email about the eGift Cards states that the cards will come after the 14th. But the same email also says that if the cards are not redeemed by the 14th they will be void. You can talk to no one about this; They are supposed to respond tomorrow. We'll see. Only real request was to change rooms because we'd like to have a nice view for our 20th anniversary. No on cares. No room changes ever unless you want to pay a lot more. Resort fee is as much as we used to pay for the room! Customer service used to be important. Now you are a nuisance. I was told by a host that I was spoiled because I was given a better room last year. But we have come for over 20 years. So it is not just last year. It is not just being ""spoiled"". It is a change in approach from being service oriented and trying to please the customer to scoffing at the customer with disdain and dismissing any concern. I'm wasting my breath. No one at Caesars cares. Just be careful when you go. Don't expect a lot. If you're happy with what they give you you're good. If not don't expect anyone to care. It's just sad that it's not what it used to be. We should have stayed at MGM."
50,This hotel is super nice and located on the middle of the strip were everything is nearby  super recommended. The room is super nice the pool is amazing and perfect view. Can‚Äôt wait to come back visit.
10,No housekeeping or water Fridge in the rooms.i really like my room clean daily  Staff was nice If you are going to the pool Valentina was amazing first day cocktail waitress was rude and drinks are 30.00  Need to be nice for that kind of money  Plus very slow service when you need towel or new cup to the room  Cesars needs a facelift would not recommend
50,We enjoyed our time at Caesar's Palace it was a lot of fun for sure even though Vegas is just reopening. Valet service is not available so parking was an issue having to allow enough time for getting to our vehicle and back as the parking garage is not right in the hotel; but we were able to work it out. Shows aren't happening yet but we found lots to do; shopping gambling sight-seeing dining out; it was just a great time a beautifully appointed 31st story room overlooking the strip and Caesar's staff were just great; we'll be back!
30,have been going to Vegas for years and have stayed at Ceasars before.  The service has always been one of the selling points. The fact that room service and the valet was not available was never talked about until I was checking in. These 2 things are a big part of the package. Even worse no noticeable difference in price compared to pre-covid price. I ended up going to Walgreens at midnight to get an overpriced coffee maker coffee and creamer. Ceasars should be more forthcoming about what services and restaurants they have available.
30,Check In personnel were polite and efficient. Diamond check in took 20 minutes. Food court closed at midnight on Saturday night. Very sad. 20 people waiting in line to buy chips at convenience store st 1229am Saturday. Drink service was extremely poor. I played on same machine 4.5 hours and only was offered one drink. I am Diamond Plus playing $12.50. a spin. Social distancing is not a priority. Employees need to spread chairs out when chairs are moved together. All machines are on ignoring customer safety. Every other machine should be turned off. Room was mostly clean with exception of something sticky on night stand. Bathroom was very clean. Masks are only being worn by 30 percent of customer. Coming back in 1.5 weekshopefully service improves if not I will take comp rooms and reduce my play.
30,Upon the reopening of Vegas after pandemic we had existing reservations that were honored and moved to this resort. We also received a room upgrade at no cost. Upon the resort staffs indications all rooms are cleaned and sanitized upon our arrival. When I was in the room the first time I could tell areas were not properly cleaned to the staffs previous statements.
20,I highly recommend you avoid Cesars Palace now.    We arrived Friday night June 12th for a weekend stay before heading to Zion.    Cesars does not notify you that they have removed all coffee makers and refrigerators.    Cesars would not even provide a medical refrigerator.    Saturday morning.  We really need one cup of coffee a day.    Only two coffee locations exist near Cesars for coffee in the morning and they have very very long lines.    Space Jeasus!!!!  We had purchased half and half from whole foods on the drive into the strip.    But noooo.    No coffee makers.  You are forced to stand in long lines at Starbucks or Pronto.  $5.00 for small black coffee. $9.00 for a latte.    Yes ! coffee drinkers get angry when you gauge them for a single cup of coffee.  Be prepared to pay  Big money for water. It was 102 degrees when we arrived and we were nearly about to pass out.  No water available.    You should bring your own bottles of water. Stop at whole foods if you have a vehicle.    No shows available. Nearly every restaurant is closed.  Restaurants that are open are all on limited menus. Healthy menu items or Salad doesn‚Äôt seem to exist.    Be prepared to pay double prices for even NY or California restaurants prices.    Pools close at 5:00 pm. Apparently covid transmits after 5:00 pm at the pools.  BS.  Vegas is a total wasted vacation location.
20,Had 3 nights comp in octavious tower. Upon arrival told to get a smoking room would be 35.00 plus tax a night. Only in Augusta tower. Ok fine.also had to pay resort fee.for what I don't know since there is no valet no housekeeping. No kerig machine in room. No tv in bathroom. No mini bar. Room was dusty on arrival after supposedly being sanitized? Dresser and desk badly scratched up looking tired. We have been to Vegas at least 3 or 4 times a year for past 5 years.. We love Vegas  But never stayed at. Ceasers palace before.like to try different hotel so whynot since comp.  ..Well sorry 272.00 later not comp.and you lost us !! back to the Wynn we go.
10,My stay at Cesar's was horrible i understand that they just reopened after covid 19 and things would be a little different and challenging for all we checked in mon 8 jun2020 - 11 jun 2020 the trip was planned for my wife's birthday at booking i specifically asked about a view and assured we would have a refrigerator  the view was of the hvac system we were not permitted to change rooms even though we had only viewed our room without actually settling in room was subpar for Cesar's reputation  i understand the refrigerators are hotel size we showed up with perishable items and a fresh gallon of ice cream cake to be delivered next morning no refrigerator available and no working ice machines for guest or my cooler we were only permitted to get 2 small cups of ice per day from downstairs bar this was not understandable as people at pool who had cabanas were able to have buckets of ice at their disposal we were given a credit to use at bars or for food we were embarrassed as front desk made mistake twice by denying our privilege to charge to room as they said i used a debit card instead of credit card which was false constantly told no front desk mngr available to resolve issue  on last day of stay in the evening time we tried to order a baileys irish cream and coffee and told coffee machine was broken and that there was only one machine for hotel and starbucks was closed several floor girls told us this no words at this point also upon returning to our room tv was not working correctly and non usable  talked to guest service's told work order would be summited with no eta of repair  again we were understanding to covid 19 changes but this stay was unacceptable for the quality of hotel cesars palace is known for we stayed at same hotel july 2017 suite and cabana trip was impeccable and enjoyable top notch service and hospitality  Cesar's needs major improvement in the way they conduct business as of jun 2020  thank you to front desk mngr/supv conrad and sarah for assisting with our issues very professional guest service's did nothing wrong but (the phrase i don't know) is unacceptable it is ok not to know something but please find someone who does know the answer  reservation # HXZD3  fdau916@yahoo.com thank you
50,Great 3 days at Ceasars! Xavier was helpful and friendly at check in. Perfect vacation beautiful room. Palace Tower was very convenient to pool casino floor and Forum shops. Despite Covid 19 situation staff was caring and safety conscious in wearing masks and keeping facilities sanitized.
20,My girlfriend and I came here from Tuesday to Friday. At check in the woman that helped us was wonderful and got me an upgraded room. Unfortunately we went up to the room wiped everything down with disinfectant wipes to be extra careful and it turns out the room was unbelievably dirty and even found hair in the bathtub. Got moved to a nicer room but the air conditioning barely worked so it was about 80 degrees in the room causing me to not be able to sleep. The next day we got upgraded to an even nicer room which was beautiful and had a great view. Even with this room though there were a couple holes in the wall near our bed the WiFi connection was terrible and our tv didn‚Äôt work but we let that go since we didn‚Äôt feel like complaining again. Very hard to get cocktails at machines/tables since the waitresses were scarce. I will not stay at a Caesars property again. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre ready for reopening after covid-19.
20,We arrived Monday morning at Flamingo and were immediately turned off by the lack of cleanliness and overall condition of the hotel room. Looking for better and cleaner options we arrived to Caesar‚Äôs and were grateful to see the staff wiping the countertops however that is the only positive thing to note. The first room we were given had mold in the shower ceiling and tile! Not the Caesar‚Äôs Palace experience I expected. After notifying the front desk they kindly put us in a ‚Äúnicer tower‚Äù the view was great however the shower head barely pulled out and the bathtub was filthy! No worse feeling than coming in to the room after being in the casino and wanting to get clean before bed or even to relax in our hotel room. After having so much excitement to visit our favorite city we were greatly disappointed with the conditions of BOTH rooms. With all this time off it‚Äôs even hard to believe anything was prepped to be fixed and/or ready for their guests. We were exhausted from the room changes and not comfortable with the conditions of our rooms so we made a safer choice to check out a couple days early and head home. I hope they make these much needed changes and better prepare for future guests but unfortunately don‚Äôt think they were ready just yet.
40,Valet is not open have to self park. There are about 4 waitress for the hole casino gambled for 4 hours last night received 1 drink. Do not think they were ready to open. I'll try out the pool today & see how it is but will probably leave early.
50,Thanks so much to all of you who worked so hard to make our stay over Caesars official OPENING WEEKEND both SAFE AND FABULOUS! We really had a great time and cannot express enough the level of comfort you added to our experience during this unsettling time.    May you continue to see more and more of the NEW NORMAL volumes that you are so used to seeing previously and may Caesars continue to thrive with the hustle and bustle you so deserve!!!!    Thanks again for a terrific stay! Already looking forward to a repeat sometime SOON! Maybe New Years Eve???!!!    Anne and Ray Litwin
30,This was the first weekend the hotel was open after the Covid-19 pandemic situation so of course there was going to be some hiccups but when it came to cleanliness there shouldn‚Äôt have been an excuse. My room was covered in dust makeup was present from a previous stay as well as pills and food on the ground. The wall paper was peeling in the hallway next to my room and I didn‚Äôt witness anyone doing any wipe downs or sanitation of the machines throughout my weekend stay. Thankfully I brought my own stuff to do so. I was expecting go to see this since they were advertising doing so on the website. I understand we are all adjusting but overall my room experience is what really disappoints me the most.
20,"I live in Las Vegas and decided on a ""stay cation"" to celebrate the re-opening of the hotels gaming and pools. The room was extremely underwelming. Definately the OLDER tower? (closest to the player club). The pool was nice but on Saturday they were at partial capacity but were not checking room keys to get in lots of questionable ""guests"" resulting in a 45 minute wait in line. Disappointing...however they were checking keys on Sunday. There is NO WHERE for a resonable breakfast...other than the high end resturants there are very few options for other meals. The gaming was as expected crowded and very few tables at $25.. I'll try again when things settle and down make sure I get a room worthy of Caesars reputation."
50,Caesar‚Äôs Palace is nice clean and very safe to visit.There are many restaurants to  Dine in and they are following the Government guidelines.security personnel are very visible every corner. Wishing they prohibit smoking in more areas .winners are everywhere!
20,Was in town for the re-opening and was comped a room in the Augusta towers.    From the reviews I was told that these are the nicest rooms that Caesars has.....I was disappointed.....I've attached a few pictures showing major chips in the furniture and how worn the carpet is....I expected better.    The view of the Bellagio fountains is amazing but the walk to the parking garage is brutal.    They were not prepared for the re-opening......you couldn't find a seat for pai-gow or at the craps table.....not enough opened and very few at the low limit of $25.00
50,The Caesar Hotel Receptionist named Delano did an awesome job providing quality customer service for my check in. His professionalism and concern for my stay at the hotel is by far the best experience that I had in Vegas.    Please hire more people like Delano
50,I was impressed with the turnout of locals and tourists. Caesar's was great with the transition for CDC regulations. The pool is open and I didn't feel like we were in a pandemic at all. Can't wait to come back.
20,"Let's just say save your money because the ""status"" Ceaser's one had is history. About once a month my husband and I visit Vegas for a long weekend getaway and we have stayed at Ceaser's palace many times. I think I might have had better service and comfort at a Motel 8 it was that bad. No hot water until the second day of my trip after brining it to staffs attention 4 different times with refusal of changing rooms. The pool is littered with garbage. Our kids found it ""fun"" hunting for treasure. Due to covid changes some entrances and exits for the pool were closed yet their is still staff visible and NO sign stating that entrance/exit is closed and staff didn't bother to tell the line of ppl waiting to enter that they would be unable to enter through that door. They let us stand there and wait in swimming suites and all ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è common sense and good costumer service would have never allowed this to happen.  The food that was open for sick grab and go was bland and not fresh.  In general the prices verse quality are on two different levels."
50,Reyna    Thank you so much for such a smooth seamless check in experience. We knew coming to Las Vegas during these times can be challenging. You single handedly changed that and made us feel welcome and gave us the road map to have a good time from the get go. Thanks again for your personal touch during these trying time for us all it means the world!
20,I have always wanted to stay at Caesars Palace and I dont think ill be staying again. Although the decor is really nice the room was hot as heck. The hotel was hot in general. But The room stayed at 78 degrees. I call for service they sent maintenance twice but the problem wasn't resolved. Was 112 degrees outside and the room provided no relief. Service wasn't great. Was very disappointed.
10,"We bought tickets for a concert at Caesars Coliseum and booked a room there too so we would be right there for the show. We booked 6 months out. We arrived and they said they had no rooms and transferred us to one of their other hotels Bally's. very disappointing and clearly just an attempt to draw people and and leave them with no options to force you to fill their other properties. I wouldn't stay again at a Caesars Property if they gave me free gambling flight and hotel. Lousy way to treat their ""guests"" Bad Go Somewhere Else"
50,With all that is going on I just wanted to write and say I miss Jay's hospitality at the diamond desk. He was always most welcoming and made the experience perfect every trip. Can't wait for our next visit    V/r  Matthew Watson
20,I've been a Vegas visitor since the mid-80's...dozens of times. Stayed all over Vegas several times at Caesars. It' been about 8 years since my last trip. Boy was I shocked!...First a small bottle of water in your room...$8.50. A 2-cup carafe of coffee in the room...$14.00. My wife and I had a breakfast of eggs bacon and toast in their cafe one morning...with tip the total was over $50!!!!  I'll never say never but it's probably my last vegas trip. Everything up and down the strip was the same...and the old way of making you feel welcome while they take your money at the tables...all gone.  Last I couldn't believe it but they have actually found ways to increase the house advantage at every casino game. I assume the young kids that swamp Vegas these days just don't know the difference...but it was sad to see. After the first day there I quickly saw how they'd change the payouts on the Blackjack tables..and at the crap tables...and after losing a couple hundred dollars...I didn't gamble another dollar the entire trip.  Used to be a fantastic trip...good reasonable food...super friendly casino workers...and great shows at reasonable costs. Well....those days are past I guess. The entire trip was dogding kids crowding the sidewalks and looking for a place to eat where the check for two people would be under $300.  For anyone that remembers how vegas used to be...and likes to gamble....forget it.
50,I chose it because of the movie The Hangover. I didn't have any tigers in my room nor met Mike Tyson but otherwise I was not disappointed. I will definitely be going agin and bringing a bunch of friends too!
40,booked for 2 nights and made to leave after 1 night due to hotel closing because of COVID 19 fair enough but charged for the 2 nights. Emailed the company we booked with and heard nothing back. Hotel is beautiful however due to the circumstances could not enjoy it. Booked this through Trivago and then this went through with Hotel Bookings @ Cancelon
50,24 fraternity brothers in their 50s reunited around an FFL Draft held at the MonteCristo Cigar Bar. Wonderful service food and beverages in a very convenient location within the complex.  They've changed the rules at many of the Blackjack tables (and not in our favor) so enjoyed working out each morning at the gorgeous fitness centers and then hitting the pools. College football season was in week one so had a few wagers but could not access a seat in the sportbook without a reservation. The guy taking my bets gave me 5 drink tickets so hung out at the bar bordering the book and watched games with the masses. A few guys rented a car on property and went and hiked Red Rock Canyon went to shows and ate all around town. Within Caesars cannot say enough positive about Pronto by Giada as an amazing place to get fresh gourmet to-go food alongside a full bar that would make up several drinks to go and you could take it all with you whereever you chose. Fabulous food at reasonable prices. Caesar's staff is wonderful and will go above & beyond to meet all requests. Location for walking is wonderful and many of the towers have been renovated. Automated checkin kiosks remove need to stand in line. Great place to stay for any occassion!
10,Arrived inCaesars Palace Saturday the 14th of March just as President Trump announced the UK flight ban. Was immediately told at reception our rooms were not quite ready yet and we should go for something to eat and come back in an hour we were offered a credit of $100 dollars Bill was $180. Not a good start as this was 19:00 and after a 12 hour flight. Next day was ok but on Sunday we did not get our room serviced and had no communication from the hotel as to the ongoing situation. I have to say that from that point onwards we had to ask on every occasion what was happening we got more information from our waitress than any of the management team. On the Tuesday we asked for an update at the front desk to be told we would have to leave the hotel by 12:00 next day no alternative accommodation was being offered as this was direct from the Nevada governor so if we did not leave our room a state police officer would eject us. Horrified to say the least. At breakfast the next morning suitcases in hand we were informed again by the waitress a stay of execution had been agreed by the governor and we could stay another night we then asked at reception and this was confirmed. I could go on but the main point of this review is the total lack of communication and disregard for a duty of care to all the customers left in this predicament. The management should be ashamed of their response during this stressful time for all concerned. I will not be back.  Regards  Jay S
50,My room in the Augustus Tower was excellent. I was actually able to have cell phone reception this time. The front desk agent(Suki) did a great job checking me in at the time of my arrival. The personnel at 7 Star valet parking is one the best on the strip.
50,I enjoyed my stay at Caesars very much but it was shut down by the gaming board early due to the Corona Virus. Everything about the place other than that was totally amazing. I would definitely recommend the Caesars Palace to stay
50,Hotel is clean staff was friendly. All my guests enjoyed their stay and hopefully we will be back soon. Also due to the corona virus all my contacts were very accommodating . Most of our customers swore they will be back as soon as we are safe to travel    Thank you for your hospitality.
50,The room was very nice and updated. Excellent view of the pool. My kids had a blast and enjoyed the trip very much. There were many activities for the kids to do in Vegas. The hotel has a updated gym equipment.
50,My first time is Vegas was far better than i could have imagined. From the food to the customer service and the night/ day activities all and all was a great experience.  Thanks to Caesar's Palace we will return!
20,It started at checkin- room was not ready I was told it would be ready within 2 hours  hotel clerk would call me. After 4 hours and no call I had to go back to check-in to receive a room. It was a downgrade The mini bar was missing items when the lady came in to check the mini-bar I told her about it. I was still charged for the items even after I told her. I was offered a $600 dollar dining credit when I made my reservation I was charged for dining when I checked out. When I went to the hotel checkin counter to check out I was told I would not be charged yet I was charged 
50,Ot was great place to stay staff great scores great there was so much to see it had great pool and so much do and see alot places walk look at there shops great so many in hotel the place was so great
30,My girlfriend and I were hoping to get a room upgrade at no charge we are both Diamond plus players and were there for the millionaire slot tournament but after the host was called I don't they even check our play we spend a lot of money at Harrahs So. Cal. and after donating around 3K at Ceasers Harrahs and the Flamingo it would have been nice to get a free upgrade.
50,Rooms are awesome! Quiet super comfortable beds and linens. Always spotless  I am just filling this up with useless words to meet the 200 character minimu  Which is a wastenof my time. The should never be a mandatory entry requirement
50,Exceptional quality of the room. Fixtures and decor were top of the line and provided a very comfortable experience. The bell staff person was very helpful and knowledgable.and a wonderful personality. Caesars is indeed a quality property.
50,Great service very nice room . The location was in the heart of the strip. The property was too big for me because ther are alot of shops to see. The service was great and very helpful and a lot to eatwith many places to chose from.
30,Room was nice and had a great view. However they never once came to clean or refresh the room the whole time we stayed. Also while at the cashier there was a huge cockroach on the floor! Also the slot machine play was awful.
50,Caesars Palace is the best! Staff is always great! Love the rooms and slot machines. This visit was different due to the Coronavirus. Not as many people and restaurants were closing. Left just before Vegas closed!!
40,The hotel is beautiful and location excellent. Love the easy walk to all good shows and other hotels on the strip.  Had a disappointing check in as our room was not available the first night and the only explanation offered was something had come up and another room would possibly be available the next day and we should check back in. Long lines at the reception every time we needed something but the next day we did get our suite.  It does make unpacking and packing difficult when one just wants to enjoy their short vacation.  Wifi for 2 devices was not enough for a family of four and connection was intermittent.  Our room was also not made the first day even though we were gone from 6.45 am and had to call to get it made by late evening.
50,Stayed for 7 days in the Laurel suiets. The room was nice and service was excellent as always. I prefer Palazzio suites at the Venetian but that is splitting hairs. Caesars is always excellent and go out of their way to make your stay exceptional. Coronavirus scare cut our trip short be safe.
50,Kevin H. at checkin provided a great start to a little getaway. His exceptional service were a great start to our little getaway. His personal skills were delightful. Kevin‚Äôs desire to ensure we were satisfied with our accommodations was impressive. I hope Caesar‚Äôs treats Kevin well because he has a bright career ahead.
30,Caesers palace usually delivers but this trip they treated me like a 2nd class citizen this trip I think they should swap out some people from VIP check in or give them explanation of how much money a 7stars member actually spends to get to that level
40,Ours experience overall at the Caesar properties was wonderful. Hotel was great casino was super fun atmosphere & there are also so much more fun to do & see at various Caesars venues. We‚Äôre love hanging out at the Caesars palace there‚Äôs endless things to see & to do. We‚Äôre Definitely be back to Vegas sometime this year‚Äôs & will stay at Caesars palace cause of the location & the wonderful atmosphere.
50,Ceasars Palace is an iconic place in Vegas...well worth the hype...hope to go back. The architecture is stunning. It is extremely large. Only thing is if you needed a wheelchair not sure if they had them available.
50,"Caesar's is the Golden Star of the Strip. This is the ""Center' of Vegas""! Great rooms fantastic food and entertainment and an atmosphere that separates Caesar's from the rest. The staff here are pros at making you feel like you are a part of the action. If you're looking for the 'complete' Vegas experience this is where you begin!"
50,Been several years since I stayed at Caesars Palace. Usually stay at Paris or Harrahs. Arrived at valet with the masses but was greeted quickly and kindly. Same goes for the Bell staff. Check in was a breeze and the room (suite) was very nice. Good dining options and pleasant servers.
30,caesar's has cut back services to it customers. no shuttle to the rio no complimentary diamond lounge. no pads nor pens in its rooms. cutbacks lead to customer disatisfaction. go ahead save a couple pennies and risk losing customers.
40,On this trip I did not get a chance to stay at a room in the Caesar‚Äôs Palace but I do look forward to staying there in the near future. Hopefully I can get complementary rooms so that I can experience all of what Caesar‚Äôs Palace has to offer.
10,Room: Shower did not work. Makeup mirror broken. Complained but mirror continued not to work and show continued to leak but at least worked. Room had dust bunnies in all corners. Furniture tops were scratched and sticky.  Billing: A free trip to the millionaire tournament was supposed to be totally free. I was charged 51.02 per day resort fees which took me quite a few phone calls to get refunded. Then I was charged $182.75 for purchases which I never made. I finally got them to agree that the bill was in error however I am still waiting for a refund. I and my husband will never stay at Caesars again dirty unorganized and unprofessional.. Additionally when asking questions noone seems to know the answers. I spent more time trying to find someone knowledgeable than having fun.
50,It was both relaxing and exciting. The room was spacious and the view of the Las Vegas lights was spectacular. The night life in the casino was energetic with a lively band every night through the morning hours and a wonderful choice of restaurants and shops.
50,Great place to stay right at the Vegas Strip Iconic and never gets old :) best location to set base and walk to other places great shopping ... the hotel itself has superb facilities friendly and knowledgeable staff !
50,Love all the Caesar‚Äôs properties. They never disappoint. The properties are not only clean but are well decorated and beautiful!! The staff are always available and always friendly willing to help and answer questions. The casino floor has all my favorite games!
30,We actually left & Flew back to California the Day before the Strip Was Shut Down Due to the Covid-19 Outbreak üò∑ I believe Caesar‚Äôs should have cancelled the Millionaire Maker 2020 final. After all the Rounds were completed they sent a Voicemail that the Dinner would be Cancelled. They did apply a $150 dollar Dinning Credit to your room.
40,rooom nice Location great atmosphere good need more personnel on the casino floor  The casino is overall very nice and a good atmosphere for gamblers.  Resturants are very good throught the grounds.  The location is very central to anything you may need or want to see.
40,Perfect location it is right on Las Vegas Strip and within a short walking distance to have access to other properties and store. The room is excellent and foods are good!  also it has a very nice shopping inside of the hotel.  Over allare very excellent!..
50,I booked a last minute room to Caesars to celebrate my birthday. I was pleasantly surprised when the guy behind the desk Kevin not only acknowledged my birthday but also took the liberty of upgrading my room. The room was pristine. Very clean and very nice. I also had a great view of the strip. The shopping and the restaurants in the casino were also top notch.
50,Clean friendly and willing to help at every level. Room was nice cleaned daily and in a timely manner. Front desk was extremely helpful in getting me in a very nice room. Casino floor was clean and dealers were friendly and full of personality . Great visit!
40,Got upgraded to a suite without asking. All tables closed as soon as we got there. Suite is perfectly cleb with all amenities including mini bar. Strange to be in Vegas during Coronavirus... it's empty.
50,Great rooms and great places to eat. Parking costs for non gamblers but that's not me. Loved giada's pronto cafe and good selection of slot machines and table games. Room was awesome. And the bathroom was super high end.
50,Caesar Palace was beautiful!!! The beds and pillows were very comfortable. Can‚Äôt wait to go back. I really enjoyed the Forum shops and the different restaurants throughout the resort. Grabbing an Uber was very easy.
50,Excellent hotel always above my expectations. Caesar's properties are keeping the gaming floor sanitized. Although events have been canceled I felt good about spending time on the floor. Restaurants were seating folks sparsely.
50,Best thing was the people. I stayed in Augustus tower view of the Belagio. best bathroom design roomy shower tub with jets. I dont spend a lot of time in my room in  vegas but very comfortable.  My best impression from Caesars was the staff. all competent proffessional and pleasant Multitude of food venues and again top notch staff
50,Great accommodations. Super clean rooms. Great shopping casino entertainment and five star dining experience. Gaming odds could be better. Jacuzzi in bathroom. Food court with good food and several bar areas.
30,The man who checked us in (Tomasek) was very good and professional.He also gave us a nice upgrade. The room had several nice features (partial Strip view Jacuzzi) but the shower leaked water into room with the toilet. In addition one of the sinks didn't drain properly nobody came to fix the shower even after we asked and housekeeping didn't make our room one day. Caesar's is a famous casino but it failed to justify its reputation.
50,Rooms are very  comfortable and spacious. Employees are always helpful and food is great. Employees recommended food or services according to your budget. When there is any need for service or a problem the employees are quick to accommodate you.
40,The hotel is in a great location. The room was nice and bed was comfortable. The service was great. It‚Äôs just a bit too big of a hotel for me. Easy to get lost in. But otherwise we had a great time there.
50,room was great. the location to other venues was good. restaurants many and good. a little pricy. We saw Rod Stewart and his concert was very good. we were pleased with the service at the hotel and the restaurants as well as the gambling.
50,I have to say thank you to Caesars Palace and Caesars Resorts in general.    I've enjoyed gamblin with you your casino is large clean and has a large selection of slot machines. Restaurant selection is good and my wife and I like your Laurel Lounge a lot.    The employees are very friendly and service is good.    I also want to say thank you for staying open unlike MGM and Wynn. People need to get out more not isolate themselves. Businesses need revenue and employees need jobs and a paycheck. I'm done with Mlife/MGM Resor  ts. What I used to spend with them I will now spend with you. After my latest tier creidts come in I'll be Diamond Plus. Will probably hit Elite or even Seven Stars this year.    Thank you again.
50,S√∫per clean organized I‚Äôm recommend this place super clean excellent good service and berry friendly staff excellent  Food was excellent and good prices love this place l planning to come back again good slots machines nice tables for games
50,Highly recommend Caesars was to much fun keep doing what you do no need for improvement here thank you once again for the great time and will return when our next vacation together comes soon I hope
40,Caesars Palace is a Beautiful Hotel and is centrally located. There is much to see and to partake however one must navigate the property solo The service was scarce considering it is such a large hotel and this would have been much needed and appreciated.
50,Great place to get away for a few days...Awesome hospitality to be found. Bobby FlaysGordon RamseyThe Buffet.for foodies like us.Or yummy crepes & Smashburger in the food court. Great venue for concerts. Elton John & Rod Stewart so far...And the jetted bathtub with wine is a great way to relax after a day of lots of walking & sightseeing! Got home yesterday & ready to go back tomorrow!
50,Stayed in the palace Premium it was a great room plenty of space! Great view of strip and mountains in the distance. It‚Äôs right Next to the pool area. Had a Great Time for my B-day and can‚Äôt wait to go again
40,I ended up using a third party to book my room and the third party ended up canceling my reservation without any notice. Gonna went above and beyond to find my husband and I a room and saved our trip.
10,The experience was awful from check in to check out. We used the kiosk and prechecked in that was no help. Without getting into the boring details of why it didn‚Äôt work the end game was our room still wasn‚Äôt ready after 530 (after prechecking in) and was u knowingly downgraded and basically ignored by the attendant when I tried to ask questions. So blatantly ignored that him and his colleague walked away from me as we were talking to them. Long story short they switched our tower from the updated tower I booked and downgraded me to a room that was smaller and not updated without even having the decency to tell me. They manually switched the room so they knew they had done this. The rest of the experience is no better. The room was not at all like the one I booked it was old and dingy. Had a dirty tissue paper on the floor in the bathroom. Our keys never worked and couldn‚Äôt get off the elevator without the help of a stranger. This was every single time after switching keys. And no one cared to apologize or make it right. I will never stay here again... this was my first and last experience. I usually stay at the Cosmo or palazzo but stayed here for the convenience since we came to see Mariah. Well that proved to be a terrible mistake. Do yourselves a favor and take your money elsewhere... don‚Äôt let these people ruin your good weekend.
50,First time staying at Paris. Price for value extremely worthy. The staff were very professional friendly and helpful. It is conveniently located centrally on the strip. It‚Äôs a little older but still has class. Very clean. Room service is superb but does have excessive charges especially when you‚Äôre already paying resort fees daily. (Every Vegas strip hotel does this nickel and dime gouging).
40,Stayed for four nights in an upgraded Augustus Tower fountain view room which was ready @ 9:30 a.m....Score!. This is the type of room we normally stay in and all was fine in the room as usual. Housekeeping service was top notch and consumables were replenished daily. We were on a relatively high floor (second bank of elevators) and the view of the Bellagio fountains was great. Due to breaking coronavirus concerns the casino lacked the usual energy and vibe but that made getting into the restaurants and a place at the tables relatively easy. Kudos to the VIP valets at the Augustus Tower entrance who provided exceptional service (thanks Thomas!). Casears continues to provide a top tier experience recommend highly.
40,My stay at Caesar‚Äôs Palace was for the most part enjoyable. My room was clean and spacious and the amenities available were first rate. My only issue was that my room card failed 2 of 3 days causing issues in my schedule.
50,If you want to party this is the place! A fun filled environment great music and very friendly courteous staff! Lots of nice restaurants and shops! If you are not a Caesars Rewards member get on board! Lots of comps and great offers! I attended a special dinner with HGTV's famous Property Brothers - fabulous event!!!
40,Great staff great location. Will stay here again! This property has everything you need for dining entertainment and upscale gaming. Wicked fun place for couples and families. #Grazie #LiveLikeCaesar
50,Friendly staff great service rooms were very clean.Wide variety of choices for food and the buffet is second to none.No smoke smell good lighting and the servers were around often for drinks.With all the shopping availableshows and food no need to leave the property.
50,Wonderful rooms prime strip location with well chosen and trained employees. Caesar is always improving the property to enhance the guest's experience. There are several casinos in the property and the buying options in the Forum Shops cannot be matched elsewhere. I recommend this property to one and all.
50,Location is center strip. Rooms are large clean and nicely updated. Security is great. Only negative is I wish they had coffee pots in the rooms. We asked and was told only suites could have coffee pots. Seem like every place you go (outside LasVegas) have coffee pots. Maybe other casinos do have coffee pots???
50,Overall great services. Room was big and cozy and clean. Buffet was great. Also want to acknowledge a black jack dealer named Jackie. Great dealer very friendly. She worked the afternoon on the Wednesday I was there.
40,We had a group of friends and asked for adjoining rooms. The original tower we had booked didn‚Äôt have any available so the front desk upgraded us to a different tower so that we could have them. Everything was very clean and there is so much to do right there. I would only suggest that they add a fridge to the rooms instead of an already stocked mini bar with overpriced drinks/snacks.
20,The Palace Tower walkway between the casino and the elevators smelt so bad we had to hold our breath walking through. It was a sewer smell and it was there all weekend. When checking in please ask not to stay in this tower.
50,We had a great time in Las Vegas during our most recent trip. The experience for us was what we needed at this time. Our stay at Caesars Palace was really enjoyable as we met some really fabulous staff who helped us when we needed it.
50,I stayed here March 6-9 2020. We had an excellent time. I could not find my laptop the morning after we checked in. I was convinced I had it with me and filled out a report with security. Their lost claims department called me yesterday and were taking it very seriously. I had assumed housekeeping stole my laptop. However I discovered it was my mistake and I left it in the airplane. My sincerest apologies to the hotel and housekeeping staff. The food was excellent the hotel was clean and most impressively I never smelled the cigarette smoke in the casino! Thank you Caesars for the good time and for putting up with a customer who was completely wrong!
50,Eric in the Diamond Checkin was friendly and helpful explaining the different options available and made sure we had all our questions answered. This property has so much to offer from great restaurants to shopping in the Forum Shops to gaming.
20,Stayed here from March 5 to 10 2020. Overpriced everything. The weather was beautiful - only one pool out of five was open and there were no seats. People were sitting on the ground. Check in and out was long. Showers were barely room temperature. The TV glitched in and out. And you pay for everything. You cannot use the fridge unless you pay $75.00. No coffee in the room unless you pay for it. Coffee in lobby for a large was $7.99 plus tax. The one employee at the pool serving drinks was rude. The manager that checked me out was rude. Line ups were long. That being said the room was nice and clean - but there are so many hotels I would not choose this one. Probably the most expensive one there and there is nothing extra that you get.
30,The hotel is big and busy!!!! On arrival they are many people in the lobby to include those who are in the casino and having drinks etc. For a five star hotel their check in and the way staff greet their customers definitely need to change. This is the first time I have stayed in a five star hotel which does NOT offer you complimentary tea/coffee or any kind of drinks seriously. All the five star hotels that I‚Äôm used to offers a little extra.    The rooms are nicely decorated and spacious. However for the price the hotel needs to care for their customers a little bit more by offering a bit of extras e.g bathrobes slippers and free drinks. I would rather have these little extras than very spacious rooms (after upgraded to palace tower suit) because it‚Äôs about these little things as well NOT just deco and big rooms!!!!!!!!!!!
10,"When we got to the hotel to check in we paid for the upgrade got to our room and it was nice Housekeeping never cleaned our room. They knocked and we were getting ready and told them a few minutes we left for 3-4 hrs. and came back and our room was the way we had left it. There was A refrigerator in the room with outrageously priced snacks and drinks. I have medication that needs to be refrigerated so I moved some drinks so I can place my medication in the refrigerator. There‚Äôs a sign that says if drinks are removed you'll be charged we didn't remove the drinks we moved them to the top of the dresser with the snacks. The day were leaving we notice the sign says if you used the refreshment center for personal use a $75 charge will incur. My stomach sank since I used it for my medication I need to live. So we went to check out and had $180+ of charges we asked why and they say the drinks are on a scale so when they‚Äôre moved they charge you for the items. Nowhere does it say if you move or touch the items you'll get charged. So we disputed the charges and talked to a manager Emma and we tried to explain it was an error on our end and she was so dismissive and didn‚Äôt care what we had to say or what we were trying to tell her She‚Äôd cut us off. She told us we can go get the items we were charged for or get the $75 charge since they have no way of knowing if the items are contaminated or damaged. She didn't even offer to have someone to check or offer any type of help nor did she give me that chance to explain to her that I used it for medication. It‚Äôs like she has a script and sticks to it ""personal and medicinal refrigerators can be purchased for your stay"" nowhere in this ""upgraded room"" does it say that. We paid extra money for and upgrade to not have certain amenities provided is not OK and now I'm forced to choose to pay $180 or $75! So we have them put the $75 charge and I figured I could call corporate for some extra support. That was even worse! they stated that they can‚Äôt override anything the hotel does and that I already disputed the $180 charge. Why bother having corporate or customer service? So I asked for a hotel manager and apparently Emma and the other managers that guests talk to are hotel managers. So basically no one higher can help. This was the worst experience we've had over a darn refrigerator error. We've stayed at other hotels that have had snacks and drinks and have put my medication in the fridge and have never had an issue."
50,Me and my partner went around the inside and the outside of the hotel and loved how pretty and huge it is. We loved the Fountain of the Gods at the Colosseum part of Caesars Palace but we only found out that it has its own type of show/performance after we left Vegas which was really unfortunate.    We visited Gordon Ramsey's Hell's Kitchen which was amazing and we also sat outside in the sun at the Spanish Steps Bar and was mortified when we bought 2 cans of beer (Miller Light and Corona) and it was $35 but understandable for being within the big hotel.
30,The room I was given at check in had a king bed as I reserved but the room smelled of smoke so after housekeeping came by to spray the room and that did nothing to git rid of the smell I asked for a new room and was given a 2-queen handicapped accessible room. This is not what I reserved and the quality of the new room was not on par with the original room: there were no sofas no king bed and the only chair in the room had seen better days (it was dirty!) but since the room did not smell of smoke and after my initial encounter at the front desk where getting a new room was like pulling teeth it finally got to the point where I just decided to accept what I was given but this has definitely soured my attitude toward this property. I think my experience is likely isolated and that it's possible to have a good experience at this hotel but for me I'll look elsewhere for accommodations in the future.
50,I booked a Julius Premium Suite for 2 nights about ~$300/night before taxes.  I checked in at 11:30 AM for my reservation at the Diamond/Seven Star check-in lobby. The lady at the front desk was lovely and helpful. She also let us know that we can come by the lobby to grab free coffee and cookies anytime during our stay. Even though our original room booked wasn't ready she was more than willing to help us get us a free upgrade to Augustus Premium Suite corner room with the best views of the strip and Bellagio Fountain. I looked up the price for this room was almost double my original book. This was a huge surprise for my girlfriend and me we kept thinking to ourselves that this is too good to be true but it did happen.  + The suite was huge and it is a corner suite so it is very private compare to any room on the same floor.  + The room also has an option to book another side connect to the suite.  + The view is amazing as you can have probably the best suite view of the strip Drais beach club and the Bellagio fountain.    Plenty of restaurants and shops inside the resort to choose from. The Bacchanal Buffet inside Caesars is one of my favorite buffets in Vegas. I would say it's the best buffet for brunch. This is also one of the great places to use hotel loyalty perks such as expedited entry and celebration dining credit.  + Skip the line during dinner (normal wait time was over an hour). We walked right in with preferred seating.  + We also got complimentary champagne.  + $100 Celebration dining credit for Diamond member.  + Great variety of food.  + Food quality here is excellent.    I stayed at Caesars several times at different properties. I can tell you the service here is top-notch best of the best you will get in Vegas. Especially if you have hotel status with Caesars. If you ever plan to stay at Caesars I recommend the Augustus tower since it has been renovated recently and some rooms have the view of the Bellagio fountain. This tower also the closest tower to the strip. 10/10 would love to come back!
50,Had a great time slots were fun and were very loose. Food was good and a variety of food courts and restaurants. Rooms were clean and well outfitted with all the amenities. personnel were polite and accommodating. Highly recommended staying at Caesar hotel and casino
30,I booked the forum classic suite we had stayed there before. However this time the sectional sofa that was on the suite was super super used it look so old and it was full of lint the pillows weren‚Äôt even fixed. The room was clean don‚Äôt touch the mini bar it automatically charges to your card on file. The lobby is beautiful but I won‚Äôt be likely staying here again.
40,I had originally booked Julius tower. When I asked Macy at the front desk for a quiet room she upgraded me free of charge to the Octivas tower. My room was gorgeous. The bathroom was opulent and beautiful. I had a view of the pools mountains and some of the strip. Macy made my stay wonderful. Thank you!
30,Very clean great restaurants & shops. Just make sure you‚Äôve got a map to help navigate you it‚Äôs very easy to get turned around there. It is centrally locates to most of the hotels on the strip plus it‚Äôs right next to bellagio‚Äôs fountain show
50,Had a great time gambling and drinking with our friends who were staying at the hotel. I love the table games atmosphere. The dealers and pit bosses were fantastic. Had a great time!! Definitely plan to stay there one day!
50,The rooms at Caesars are top of the class. I love each and every room I have stayed in during my stays in Vegas. The grounds are beautiful. The forum shops make for a great shopping experience. The food court has great food.
40,We were fortunate to have a room that overlooked the Pool of the Gods. Just fabulous room in the Octavious Tower excellent cleaning staff prompt room service and outstanding check-in staff. The bathroom were very spacious as was the big tub for bath. As always they charge $ 51 for resort fee even though we did not utilize the pool. Octavious is a bit of a haul from the main lobby and the gaming rooms and the arena and far from the Forum. All in all when on vacation a little extra walk makes you earn the meal. We had dinner at Bobby Flay one night and at the Cheesecake Factory and both were good. There is even a food court which leaves a bit to be desired but okay for a quick meal.    Dont use taxi as you will get ripped off a bit.
40,Was a good stay and would stay again. The staff was helpful rooms were clean and comfortable. The vibe is exciting and makes it a relaxing stay. I will recommend this to friends for a good time away.
30,We arrived with an organised group and I'll luggage was taking off the bus and stored for us.  unfortunately no one told us that it was stored and when we went to check in we didn't know where my luggage was so had to go and hunt for it  The casino downstairs in the gaming area is very dated but unfortunately as a non-smoker we were struggling to breathe with all all the smokers I like to smoke everywhere and anywhere  The staff have been amazing and the girls coming round to serve drinks are really nice and friendly  The rooms are amazing clean unfortunately the lighting system is not linked up to one central console and is dated as you have to switch on and off individual lights
40,Just wish the rooms had better lighting on the Forum Tower Side very dark bathrooms and hallway. The payouts on the slot machines are not great we played 5 days at Buffalo game and we hardly one more then 4.80 and we were playing 1.80 and 2.40 each time its a shame that the payouts were horrible over 5 days and the Roulette digital game 4 of them were broken and not fixed in the 5 days. Maybe get more as so many people wanted to play its a fun game to play or get these fixed its a shame that this hotel and casino is so busy and then you have broken games. Please update them as we went to other hotels and they were the newer ones. Thank You
50,Always a marvelous time at Vegas at a Caesars property. Always clean environment lovely and extremely helpful staff. I always look forward to my Tripps and i am never disappointed. Keep up the great work with service
50,Appreciated efforts made by Michelle every time I visit the Diamond lounge during check out. Kana in the other hand helped and guaranteed requested room accomodation last February 23-26 that s right after a prejudice associate who answers ‚Äúno‚Äù every time I get to meet her. I keep forgeting her name though!  Anyway on my recent late check-in March 6-9 I am thankful that Joselyn at the front desk gave a good service and respectful too.  Please continue keeping pleasant people at the front desk during wee hours of the morning.
50,It has been a number of years since I‚Äôve been in Las Vegas and I do not remember what Caesars was like. But on this trip I liked the layout of the casino and all the extras. The food court the sports area the fine dining and the easy access to the parking garage.
50,Wonderful room with a good view-we stayed on 38th floor of the Augustus tower-beautiful strip view.  all the staff was very nice-I wanted to thank Ellen Banag-she was very nice when checking us in for the show-also loved the Caesar's Buffet-excellent variety of food-all of it was very good
50,Great location to stay and good access to strip and shopping and restaurants inside Caesars . And Caesars provide good offers to rewards and time spent in the property. Staff are good and very hospitable and good knowledge
50,Awesome place to stay at every time I come to Vegas I stay at Caesar Palace best customer service n restaurants available and the Buffett is the best in the World. The rooms are spacious n clean Forum Tower is the best!!!
50,Caesar's LV really offers the ultimate Vegas experience. The location on strip is ideal and with all the casual and fine dining inside the hotel you'll find something for everyone. Our favorite go to in the morning and afternoon is Giada's. Nobu's while quite pricey is also a great fine dining event. We stayed in the Octavius this year while last year it was in the Augtavius Tower. The King room was very spacious with modern decor with view of the Paris and Bellagio property. Gaming area could use a refresher as far as decor but plenty of action if you're into gambling. Overall a wonderful experience.
40,I was there for this passed weekend for the Bruno Mars concert. The hotel was clean and staff was attentive to my needs. Love the Julius tower rooms elevators very close. Will be staying there again. My only complaint was check in/out the lines were extremely long...if they know it is check in/out time there needs to be more staff available to accommodate the rush of people.
10,My wife & I originally booked a week at Caesars Palace in a newly renovated strip view king room but after one night in an awful completely filthy unrenovated puke smelling room and zero assistance from management we moved next door to the Bellagio who after hearing our horrible experience at Caesars Palace discounted a Penthouse Fountain View suite for us. I was a loyal member of Caesars Total Rewards but my business will never be given to Caesars again. Management did not care nor offer anything to remedy the situation. Then later in the week a Caesars staff member was told of our experience and decided to attempt to pitch a timeshare scam at us. Seriously???Hell no!!! I strongly vigorously recommend avoiding Caesars Palace at all costs! I'll choose the Bellagio 10 out of 10 times going forward.
50,It's pretty obvious to note that Caesars is the pinnacle of the Vegas Experience. Stay here and experience Vegas the way it's meant to be... Food service table games shopping etc. It's all amazing!
50,This trip was different from my usual. My room was in the Octavius Tower and it was even better than the Augustus one. Everything in the room seemed brand new the furniture and even the towels. My view was of the swimming pools. Even the bathtub seemed bigger.  One thing not so good: I woke up in the middle of The night to a sound best described as someone breathing in and out. It was probably from the plumbing system and it did stop after 15-20 minutes but it really scared me.  The fact that I lost all my money is beside the point . The only place I won something was at the airport.  Thank you Caesar I‚Äôll see you soon!!! I love you even if I lose...
10,We upgraded from 2 one bedrooms to 1 suite and an extra bedroom2 nights2 women.  They put us up on the 15th floor looking at a wall.üòµno view. I called to get another room they replied this floor was not known for views. No other rooms available.  Second day we returned from the pool to be locked out of our room. We called down 4 times. Finally a security guard arrived 45 minutes later telling not to put our do not disturb sign upthat might of been the problem. REALLY  When we went to the front desk to report our cards not working we were given 2 $35 certificates to be used in their bars/restaurants.  NEVER RETURNING TO CAESARS. TOO MANY OTHERS TO CHOOSE FROM.
30,While Caesar's is beautifully decorated and offers lots of fun and amenities they aggravate guests to the core by overcharging for most everything. If you merely open the refrigerator in your room they charge $75. If you move anything in the fridge they charge you as though you'd consumed it. They even charge you for coffee if you use their nicely provided coffee maker. Be sure to take the sink soaps to the shower before you hop in. No Q-tips. The toilet seat wobbled and the roll of TP kept sliding off the holder. However aside from those annoyances and the exorbitant prices the room was lovely .....next time I'll just be better prepared with my own cooler snacks etc.
50,I was here for the Property Brothers event and to see an old friend. To my surprise I was given an Augustus Suite. Jay who checked me in at Diamond Check in did not tell me that and so when I went upstairs I was amazed. The suite was beautiful.
50,Only negative thing about the stay. Probably heard that joke everyday throughout our trip lol but still funny. The place is great for all ages and it's location is prime. It's right in the middle so everything isn't to far. The place is clean and has friendly staff members. Highly recommended
50,I stayed in the Palace Towers. The room was exactly what I expected...awesome. I only stayed one night before heading to my designated conference hotel but I will definitely be back for a longer stay.
40,great experience and time to spend together. i would recommend that everyone try to explore the opportunity to have an experience of time together with their partner visiting this resort. Be careful not to overspend
50,the biggest hotel in town. Most hotel when I got in strong smell for smoking but not in caesar.  I think good for non smokers. And so many good restaurants in there. Try the those restaurants when you get there.
50,Being center strip where all the action is can save you alot of walking when you are buzzed. There are lots of shops and places to eat and drink. Not far from your room at all. I had a great time and will come back again.
50,I suggest they get White Claw Hard Seltzer in all flavors and at all bars this is a very popular drink these days and would make your guests happy thank you for taking the time to read and consider this
50,We enjoyed our stay a Caesars. Gambling Shopping Drinking everything we needed under one roof. We were in 4593 in the Augustus Tower which provided incredible view of the Bellagio Fountains.    All staff that I encountered were great !
50,Easy check-in rooms were spacious and nice and casino is clean. The Bellagio is next door as well as other nice casinos so it's not hard to venture out on the strip. The $45 spa is good all day and is a $30 discount versus when you stay at a different hotel. The breakfast buffet is superb though pricey.
30,average stay. The walk to the room was too long for an older couple. The linens on the bed were not soft which is unusual for a nice hotel and the room would not cool. The bathroom counters had broken pieces to the cabinet fronts. Very disappointing.
50,Clean  central lots to do shows  their is not bad seat in the house. drinks are very well poured and if the casino is not too busy  they are quick and easy to get from the servers. Rooms are very clean and the casino is fun to play in
10,I do not like this hotel I do not recommend it! We made reservations and the lady that took reservation wasn‚Äôt listening and I told her I had my pet she had me on the phone a long time while she made the adjustments and she was frustrated with me while doing that. We arrived and their is no parking we are in an oversized truck and we‚Äôre told that their is self parking  yes but not for trucks over 6ft. they didn‚Äôt tell us that when we left the valet lane or we would have let valet take care of it for $30. Instead of driving behind the hotel where we paid over $300 for the night I thing fancy looks just like other hotels. We drove to Flamingo rd and Balleys where they told us and no parking available for our truck. So we drove back to the hotel got back in the valet and by that time we did not want to go anywhere. The traffic is horrendous down town 1st time coming - get a taxi! We were in bed by 10pm. The buffet in the hotel was closed. The casino was packed in our hotel the bars were packed and no one was asking if we wanted something to drink. We asked a very rude waitress she said tell the bartender to get you a drink and walked off to the back. All this In Caesar‚Äôs Palace. The next morning we decided to check out about 10am I was scheduling a check out online and noticed my room went from almost $300 to almost very close to $500 for 1 night. I called and hotel direct because the number I called first told me they are only available mon-fri. I called the hotel direct and I was told that I couldn‚Äôt leave until a bar menus person came to do inventory in our room to see what snacks we ate. They assume you ate everything in the room and put this little sign that‚Äôs not facing you that‚Äôs it‚Äôs a charge for $13 candy and other stuff. That little snack bar is very expensive. Not knowing or being told at check in is what frustrates and upset me. I had to come back to the room and wait on this person to come to my room. It‚Äôs been an hr and I‚Äôm still waiting. The agent I spoke with about this was sarcastic didn‚Äôt care to listen and could care less I asked to escalate the call and get his supervisor and he continued to laugh as if I was stupid for not knowing. His supervisor got on the phone  asked me what I needed as I started to explain to her the first time I ever been in Las Vegas and decided to go with this hotel but that no in explained and as I was starting to do that she cut me off. And didn‚Äôt care to listen to me as well. I let her k ow that I was going to put this on review so that everyone would know how they are here as far as their don‚Äôt care attitudes. She toned it down a lot! I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO STAY HERE  unless you want to get thrown a huge one night hotel room service fees and you‚Äôve never had someone come to your room or call anyone and order room service....
50,Awesome place to stay!!! Hit the jackpot on my birthday! The was nice at the Octavius tower and the buffet at Bachannal never fails. The Food there was great as usual. I LOVE THE ATMOSPHERE AND THE WORKERS. They are very attentive and the front desk receptionist was the best. She was very professional and kind.
40,Always a pleasure to ride your chariot through the hallways of The Palace.  It's got lots of good restaurants and ...it's just fun to walk around and see the sites.  You'll enjoy taking selfies with the statues of your favorites. All Hail !!
40,This place is wonderful clean and lots to do. However in all my years of travel (60 plus) I have never had to pay for in room coffee. Hard to believe one can get free coffee at a motel but have to pay for it here.
30,I found that the charges are wrong and need refund for the charges. In haven‚Äôt used mini bar but charged.Also resort fees are charged multiple times more than number of days I stayed there. I need to file dispute of these charges.
50,Everything was good for the most part except I didn't get any vouchers during my stay. I've recieved vouchers at other Harrahs/Caesars properties. Also everytime I walked by the elevators near the Augustus Tower it smelled like sewage during my whole stay there. Other than that everything else was fine.
10,What is in the fine print is that you have to pay an extra $52.00 A DAY for a so-called resort fee. This is a deceptive practice that deceives you from to increase the advertised price. This is Illegal in Nevada but the casinos donate so much money to the politicians they look the other way.  I had a problem with the climate control and immediately called for it to be fixed nothing! All they care about is getting your money! Stay away.
50,We Were Lucky To Have Been Helped By Ray In The Diamond Registration Area Upon Our Arrival. He Was Friendly Informative And Dedicated To Providing Us With An Upgrade To Our Current Booking. During Our Registration He Recommended Several Options Of Entertainment During The Weekend. We Live Locally In LV And Have Stayed At Most Of The Caesar's Properties But Ray Clearly Stood Out Among The Desk Representatives. We Will Also Be Telling Our Vip Hostess Erin Eden About Him. During Our Check In We Asked To Speak With His Supervisor Who Was Also Very Cordial And Genuine.    Otto And Sara Berk
50,Beautiful rooms. Great places to eat. Terrific casino.  Even if you aren5 a fan of buffet dining try the one at Caesars. It is truly outstanding.  I been been to Las Vegas many times and have stayed at other casinos. Caesar's is by far the best. Safe clean many different slots shopping entertainment fantastic pool.
20,Call went there with eight guys with eight rooms they charge us eight different room rates. Total rip off from gambling to $10 ATM fees nine dollars on the water in your room. Pot of coffee and oatmeal room service $51.
50,Caesar palace hospitality is excellent ....from the valet person to my check in person.    Ray and Eric both are so nice at the VIP check in. Cherry at the reward desk is also so friendly. This is not just a one time visit I been coming in a few time more than usual they are always very polite willing to help.....    The room are always very nice....Caesar Palace definitely is my place to stay.
10,I checked in to Caesars with an online link. Was sent a confirmation code with instructions to get my key at the kiosk in the lobby. When I arrived the kiosk instructions said to go to the front desk. Waited in line for about 25 minutes. Explained to desk clerk I had checked in via the app. She said ‚Äúno you didn‚Äôt.‚Äù I told her I had the linked code and she said I must have received some other code because I wasn‚Äôt in her system. Even though I showed her the link on my cell phone with instructions to check in at the kiosk she continued to dispute this. It took her more than 10 minutes to finish the check in and she gave me my keys. I went to the room and entered with my key only to find someone else was already in the room. The people in the room contacted the front desk and they said there was a mix- up and I should ‚Äúgo wait by the elevator‚Äù while they sorted the mess out. It took another 15 minutes for someone to come up and fix the problem. I asked to see the manager or have the manager contact me but no one bothered to contact me. I‚Äôve machine was not working either. They simply don‚Äôt care! No one has called or written offering an apology. Guess they don‚Äôt care about my stay. When I texted them they said I could come to the front desk and speak to the manager. When I arrived at the front desk there was a huge line so I left. Very poor experience for me.
50,Besides Mariah being an hour late to hit the stage it was a great show and the venue was perfect. Excellent customer service every seat was a great seat and the acoustics were great. The casino was very clean and nice as well.
50,Fun place to go I play a lot of slot machines and I usually go to MGM casinos because they comp my rooms but I spent some time at Caesar‚Äôs during my stay this time and really enjoyed the variety of games and the drink service was excellent
50,"We Stayed in the Octavius Suite 65th floor! had great veiw of the ""water show"" at bellagio. Rooms was filled with bar n snacks all comp by my casino Host! Maids n guest service was very helpful! We had a jacuzzi bath tub. Hot water was not a problem. Elevators brought us straight to Casino or Food Court. Have been in this palace many times... highly recommend!"
40,Easy check-in nice room. Bring your own K-cups if you want coffee in the room without being charged. Staff were friendly but couldn‚Äôt answer what we do with our towels if we opt out if housekeeping. I would stay there again.
50,Great Location easy to walk the strip from this location it's right in the middle also if you get a chance take a ride on the High Roller it's quite the ride. We went for a quick weekend and worth every penny exspecially the buffet
20,Currently here on a 3 night vacation. We chose this hotel for its 5 stars and pool offering. We are visiting Las Vegas to get some much needed sunshine. The main pools are closed leaving just one pool open. Due to this no loungers available yesterday we paid $50 for a bed... today they have put the price of them up to $100. No maintenance is taking place on main pool area the poor weather is why it‚Äôs not currently open according to staff. It‚Äôs 26c with not a cloud in the sky. The pool is like soup with a scummy layer on the top people smoking in it flicking ash in water! Loud music pumping out... all for a party scene but would like to read my book & be able to have a conversation too at times.    Our room is also a big disappointment dated noisy no complimentary water or coffee. No shower gel towels worn and thin. Bath slowly empties as plug doesn‚Äôt work shower not great. As you walk towards palace towers there is a pungent smell of VOMIT not a one off been like it since we‚Äôve been here many people comment. No aspect of our room is luxury.    A small pina colada will set you back $20 at the pool breakfast at Americano restaurant $100 with poor service and tasteless food. Booked the $75 dollar food and beverage credit room... BA said it was daily- Caesar‚Äôs said it‚Äôs once per vacation. At check in receptionist tried to sell a upgrade for king size bed... $50 per night!    All in all NOTHING luxury about here (unless maybe your flashing the big bucks in a suite and gambling hard) it‚Äôs Vegas fully expect to spend the money but Caesars are just rinsing you.    The cosmopolitan looks lovely room with balconies and a clean swimming complex. won‚Äôt be back... please don‚Äôt be fooled by the external grandeur and glossy brochure pictures! (Will post more photos later)
50,We love staying at Caesars Palace! The rooms are clean and comfortable the casino is always lively the service is wonderful and you can't beat the location on the strip. The adjacent Forum Shops are also a perfect place to shop when visiting Caesars.
40,Room was average had trouble with the key not working but other than that all was fine overall Caesars was just too big for us we prefer smaller properties like Paris or Ballys or even the places on freemont
10,No room cleaning 2 of 3 days had to call at 5:00pm on the day it did get cleaned to get them there. I complained both times it happened and the second time did not even get asked if I needed anything.
50,If you want an absolutely great experience go to Caesars. It offers world class dining gambling spa and shopping. Caesars is in the heart of the strip by all of the action. How do you go to Vegas and not stay at the most iconic property?
40,My room was beautiful clean and very comfortable service to my room was excellent and all the employees in the hotel area have very excellent service  I stayed in Bally‚Äôs hotel and casino and food service drink service all other services other than the card gaming area I was super satisfied
50,My wife and I love to go to Caesars Palace about three times a year.  The atmosphere there is great and the only time we stray outside is for a show at another resort.  The restaurants onsite are by far tops on the strip
50,My wife and I were able to sneak away for the weekend from our busy life (with two active children in a multitude of sports and activities). Caesars did not disappoint ....as usual. Loved the upgraded sports book .....great place to watch a few games or the horses. Also....WATER GRILL is open & is the best seafood place in VEGAS ....for sure. If you love amazing food that is paired with delicious cocktails ....then you have to come eat here!!! We are already planning the next trip ....it cannot come quick enough!!!
40,Extremely nice suite and the beds were comfortable. There were several nice restaurant selections at the location as well as easy grab and go offerings. The Poker Room was regularly busy so you could always get in a game with minimal wait and the casino was busy but not crowded.
50,Eric from ceasers palace check in lounge provided us with excellent service ensuring that we got the best possible option for our needs!! I would recommend to use Eric for front desk service to others.
50,Eric who helped us checking in was SO nice! He was super helpful and informative. We‚Äôre from Canada so we had a few laughs as well it was super nice dealing with him and there was no stress! Thanks Eric :)
50,We just wanted to spend a few days relaxing and having fun. We went with our friends of over 50 years and had a very good time did some fine eating and had some good times at the slots. Will definitely go on another trip soon.
40,Staff was excellent and food was great. The only issues I had was my room wasn‚Äôt clean and the air quality in the casino isn‚Äôt very good. I wish they could install better filtration systems for a better experience.
50,Me and my husband stayed here for our honeymoon. I can say this is the nicest hotel we've ever stayed at. We loved the spa. The view was spectacular. The decor is just amazing I love the roof in the shopping areas. I wish I could've bought more merchandise. Ceasars is a big hotel. The only thing I wish is they provided a map. We got lost trying to find our room. I wish I could go back!!!
50,Love this place. Spacious rooms; Great Ambiance; Awesome restaurants/food court. Lots of Pools (one with a few black jack tables ;). Helpful and friendly hotel staff. Eclectic lounges. I strognly recommend Caesars :)
40,Overall was a good experience. Valet was little slow but good people. Trying their best. Rooms are clean. Housekeeping was good If you need something just ask. It will be provided. Restaurants are normal some good some not so. Girls servicing drinks are little slow. But again overall is good. I will highly recommend Caesars Palace as one of the best.
40,Beautiful hotel and resort with only a few minor issues. We had a non smoking room and the room still smelled of smoke a little. May not be a big deal to some but after a smoke filled casino all day we just wanted a nice smelling room. The servers at the slots were almost non existent when it came to drinks but it is what it is.
50,We did no stay here but had a great dealer that was fun and friendly. This made for a fun experience. Lots of great restaurants to choose from as well. If you are looking for a high end experience I would recommend Caesar's Palace
10,I was robbed of my personal belongings in the middle of the night while I was sleeping in my room. I lost my money and most important my life was endangered when thief could enter my room while I was sleeping at night. I reported to hotel security and Las Vegas Police but they don't seem to be too concerned. I was told it's a daily thing.  The housekeeping staff did not clean my room even when requested.
50,I am a frequent visitor to Las vegas and always stay at Caesars Palace the grand dame of hotels in Las Vegas. Modern yet still has the feel of the real Las Vegas in the 60's. The rooms and service are top notch. Location is great. I was fortunate to be checked in by Zorrex in the VIP room who went above and beyond to meet my requests thank you Zorrex. Will be back soon.
30,"Let's start off by saying the hotel is beautiful. I've been to almost all hotels on the strip now and Ceasars decor is really stunning compared to most others but lets discuss the good and the terrible.    The terrible: Had a premium queen suite in octavious tower. Upgraded to a ""view of the strip. An extra $90usd. It was mostly a view of the roof and like 2 hotels. Wouldn't have done it again. Front desk made it sound MUCH better than it was. It wouldn't matter though because we didn't stay in that room long. First thing I did was look in the tub and there were hairs in it. Called down to have a maid come to clean. Then I open the drawers to put my clothes in and there are black specks everywhere. Dirt or bugs was my question! It was dirt.. I hope. So I didnt want to put my clothes in there so we called down again to ask for a maid. We had asked for a sewing kit before we got in our room and while we were waiting for a maid they brought us 2 sewing kits that were disgustingly filthy. Like they had been sitting out for 10 years. Like attic in the ceiling filthy. It was so dirty again we couldn't tell if it was dirt or bugs. At this point I feel absolutely disgusting and start looking at everything and MY GOD this place is FILTHY. Like the room had been sitting uncleaned for months. The keruig machine was filled with dust and dirt. Same with all the the food available for purchase. All covered with a film of dirt. Even our ICE BAG was dirty. I have no idea what it was but it had like dirt or food or something in it. I felt soo icky and couldn't even bring myself to look at the bed because I was scared of what I would see. I went down stairs with pictures of the room and they upgraded us to a premium double queen room in the Augustus tower with bellagio fountain view and a $35 meal voucher. My mom really wanted that room so I said fine as long as its for sure clean. They said this room has been labeled ""inspected"" not just ""cleaned"". They said these rooms are for executives that visit. I said "" yeah god forbid they get a dirty room"" . So clearly much lower standards of cleanliness is given to just us ""normal folks"". Which is absolutely terrible considering how much Ceasars rooms are. Even the ""non executive ones"". Anyways we went to this room and it was better but it still wasn't great. Ive stayed at quality inns that have better cleanliness than these guys. The tub was clean and the drawers weren't AS dirty but the coffee machine and the food was still covered in dust. So I don't suggest ANYONE eat food from their selection as its definitely been sitting out for a very long time and it likely had dirt in it. Anyway the room upgrade and voucher was enough to shut us up and over look the still lack of cleanliness in this room. We were incredibly disappointed overall I must say. We really stretched ourselves to stay at ceasars because we thought it would be above and beyond anything weve ever been to and though the grounds are like that the room are a gross disappointed. Ceasars you REALLY have to do a better job. This was simply unacceptable and Unfortunately something that is not hard to forget for future or when telling others about it.    Another bad is that I am currently writing this at 1:50am when we are waking up early tomorrow because the music is so loud from what I assume is Omnia. We didn't hear anything our first 2 nights but tonight ( wed) the bass is thumping even with my ear plugs in I can hear it. Not even a sleeping pill is helping me sleep. They should 100% tell people if they have a room that is likely to have loud club music blasting till the early morning. Would give the people an opportunity to pick a different room.    Prices are very inflated. To be expected but pretty much everywhere in Ceasars is inflated. Not much options if you really dont want to spend much money on food that day. We went to CVS across the road and got food to save us some money because even a muffin at starbuck is $5.00    The good: The front desk staff a man in the evening was very kind and helpful. Was wonderful when we checked in and when we complained about the first room. The grounds are beautiful. Defiently a must see in vegas. The view from Augustus was incredible. Perfect view of the fountains. Didnt run into any huge crowds of partiers so that was good for my older mother. We werent looking to be at a party hotel. Location of strip is ideal. Can walk either way and cover a lot of ground. We took lyft when we were going farther. Much cheaper than taxi. We also got tickets for the deuce bus so we could go to the far end of the strip for cheaper.    Overall I am glad I stayed here but I really hope they read this and step up their cleanliness game because it really is so gross and not what you think ceasars is about. I strongly recommend anyone staying at cesars to have a look at your room before you settle in because if my stay was any indication its a good chance its filthy."
50,This was our first time staying at Ceasar‚Äôs Palace we were impressed we stood in the Forum Tower in spite of the bad reviews I was a little nervous we had a classic suite room comped the room was amazingly huge and well kept. The hotel was beautiful and the staff was amazing very friendly and accommodating. The choices of food and restaurants was great. We are Diamond members which seems to get you through very quickly in Vegas compared to the California Harrah‚Äôs.. We truly enjoyed our stay in Vegas this time around compared to the past.. we definitely will be coming back and will be staying at Ceasar‚Äôs. Thank you Ceasar‚Äôs for a wonderful experience.
50,Went for a 50th birthday weekend celebration. Very nice hotel. Its very big so took me a while to familiarize myself with where everything was. Nothing negative about it. Staff and bartenders were friendly and helpful.
10,Don‚Äôt try to save time by using the Express Check in Kiosk ( think Airline Kiosk ) they don‚Äôt work. 2 trips to get the room keys to work and finally gained access.  Sink didn‚Äôt drain and the rooms aren‚Äôt up to a high standard- Well worn and beat up.  Would have checked out but had reservations at Hell‚Äôs Kitchen
20,Spent 3 nights at Caesars in January. Would not stay there again.    Generally I found the staff to be less than friendly. They did their job but it must have been a chore because other than the outside valet team nobody seemed very happy.  .At check in we needed to reassign one of the rooms to create a separate account. We were told that was done - I had signed and initialed all the paperwork for it and handed over the credit card but it never quite happened. Couldn't figure out for two days why I couldn't get internet access - turned out it was because they didn't change the room name over on the books. They changed the credit card though. Asked the check in clerk if there was a list of restaurants in the room and was told to check the TV for information. I did that there were only three restaurants listed on the TV and only those within the Caesars confines. It didn't include any menus nor did it show any in the Forum or surrounding area. Would have been helpful at 4:00 in the morning when I wanted breakfast.    At check in they asked if I needed to have clean sheets every day I said that was not necessary but assumed they would partial-service the room on the days they didn't change sheets as most hotels do. Well I was wrong. They never serviced the room in three days. I finally had to place my overflowing wastebasket which had fruit peels and food containers in it in the middle of the upstairs hallway to get someone to empty it. I had even asked a hallway maid to do it at the end of Day 2 but it didn't happen. The staff wasn't rude but they weren't friendly either.    Other than outside valet no one made any effort to provide a level of service beyond the bare minimum and that was not what I had expected from Caesar's. The outside valet guys were fabulous They had the patience to deal with the crush of people and cars and cabs and buses and also the pedestrians who were oblivious to it all. They were helpful offered suggestions and recommendations for transportation and food. Always a smile - even at 3:30 in the morning. Yes I had several very early mornings.    The ugly resort fee reared its head again. I had seen it posted as $37/night on the web site before the room was reserved. Since there is no golf course and the pool wasn't open and the business office wasn't open 24/7 and there was limited signage or directions on the casino level it wasn't clear what the fee covered but it is because it can be I guess. When the room was reassigned at check in (about 3 weeks after initial reservation) the paperwork I had to sign said the resort fee was $45/night). Then when I checked out 3 nights later they billed it at $51.04/night. That's a lot of price increase for some benefit that remains a mystery.    A nice little Keurig-type coffee-maker in the room but no decaf coffee and if you look for decaf you get charged for the regular coffee you picked up from the serving tray to see what kind it was ). Fortunately I read all the fine print on the tray card before I made that mistake. And if you open the refrigerator to put in a medicine that needs to be kept cold you get charged $75. Read all the fine print.    There were other things I didn't like - distance to room smell in casino lack of food options at 4 a.m. for people on East Coast time music bass pounding in a room at 2 a.m on the 22nd floor (likely bouncing off the opposing building or something) and wimpy bed pillows. Nothing major but all totaled it certainly did not meet the value/price proposition I expected.....But the room was big.
50,After a long flight I was wary of further delays when it came time to check in at Caesars. However Leallysa handled my needs promptly and efficiently allowing me to get the room I requested. A warm welcome to Vegas I must admit would love for it be this simple and comfortable every time.
40,Recently stayed at Caesars LV and my vip checking person Eric was awesome.    He asked about what I was doing gave good advice when I solicited it from him (headed to Utah parks for a few days after) and also informed me of all my room options when I was inquiring.    Very polite very fast. I lost some $ at the casino but that‚Äôs one thing Eric couldn‚Äôt help me with ü§£
50,I'm here for the Sub Excel Expo and we were checking into the hotel yesterday and Nabha at the front counter was very pleasant and helpful. She told us everything we need to know about Caesars Palace and we just wanted to thank her.
50,Top Notch Girls Trip. Enjoyed the facilities the service the shows the shopping the night life the weather the people the hospitality and my friends. I was totally impressed with Caesars Palace. This was our first stay there and they made us feel right at home.
30,We did have a relaxing stay and enjoyed the shops and delicacies Caesar's had to offer. Lots of variety plenty to do and see all right inside the hotel. However I wouldn't recommend using the self service check-in kiosk. It apparently did not work and if I hadn't visited the actual counter to inquire I wouldn't have known. Also I did not appreciate the upcharge offer of $50 to have my room keys now versus wait literally 20 minutes and the room was ready!! The late check out fee WAS WORTH IT!! However it is a little tedious to have to go back and have the keys reactivated for the late check out. Not sure why this just can happen since the late check-out was already confirmed and paid. All in all it was a good trip but I likely will not stay at Caesar's but rather peruse to shop and dine.
50,This place had Plenty of good shopping. A lot of high end retailers. I love the free show and the fountains of Gods. So much to see and do. I love the art work how you feel like your outside when your not. The casino felt very inviting as well.
50,We just came for a medical conference at Caesars and Salvador made our trip flawless. The reservations I made was lost. He looked for other reservations calling other properties if I booked a sister hotel to no avail. He said after a long flight he will not let me and my wife be without a place to stay on a friday. He went to his manager got us a room . I was joking him the computer is too slow for him because it cannot keep up with his typing. Thank you Salvador you made our trip from a disaster to awesome. What a great employee you have in Salvador A.
20,WHY??!! Now I can't even self park without paying $15 and more per hour? Valet is crazy expensive. What used to be offered to get you onto their property is now being used as a total money grab. Not looking to go there any more. I will find some other destination for vacation.
50,It was awesome this is the Harrah's experience you truly enjoy about visiting Vegasfrom the time you arrive to the time you leave other than losing some monies at casino. The restaurant options and the detail to service is the reason I will definitely come back to Caesar's Palace.
40,Stayed in the Augustus Tower overlooking the Bellagio Fountains.  Superb hotel in central location.  Accommodation was excellent although the attitude of staff was diverse!  The whole complex is amazing with a good selection of high-end bars and restaurants in addition to the casino and shopping arcades.  Expensive - but I suppose you get what you pay for especially in Las Vegas.  Really enjoyed our stay and would stay here again.
10,I had a horrible experience. Before I make the reservation I called the hotel several times to make sure I can pay extra and check in earlier and they said ok.  When I arrived I had to wait until 4:30 to check in and I had to wait until 6pm for my luggages to arrive to the room.  Our plan was canceled for Saturday because of staff not being on time as they promised.  I also paid extra for the view and modern room but not only I didn‚Äôt get the view I was told the room was not modern at all. The rates were $840 for Saturday and Sunday and as you see it wasn‚Äôt cheap to stay.  I would never go again. There are so many options at Vegas that I can chose next time.
30,I had had not stayed or been to Caesars in quite a while. When you enter the lobby the overwhelming smell of smoke is awful. They really need to invest in new ventilation for their casino and public areas. Or better yet....join many other states and not allow public smoking! The newer hotels do not have this problem. The rooms are beautiful however our AC was broken and they never came to fix it.
50,First of all Michelle A at the Diamond guest registration desk is outstanding. It is rare to meet someone with such genuine unique energy. We were already having fun just by meeting her!  The Palace Tower Premium King (did I say that right?) was one of the nicest rooms I've ever stayed in at the rate I paid. The spa tub is quite nice and we had a pleasant view of the pools from the 20th floor.  The decor throughout the massive complex is actually very impressive. Let's just say it looks...expensive. Which is a good thing.  Cigarette smoke is ubiquitous throughout LV of course but our room was a refreshing place to escape.  Everyone I met at the Casino including George and Geno at the craps table were so welcoming. This place knows how to make you feel special. I will be back!
20,Not happy. A rip off. Nothing is free anymore. Not even coffee in your room. Expensive drinks and food. And then they add that resort fee in. And DO NOT take anything out of the refrigerator $$$$. The tv and whirlpool tub in the bathroom did not work. Very disappointed. Going downtown or back to Harrahs next time.
50,Caesars is by far the best property on the Las Vegas strip in my opinion. There are great people and staff starting at the valet parking guest check in floor personal and a great sports book. We love this place and cant wait to go back.
40,Clean comfortable good staff we would recommend and stay again. The show was good the bathrooms clean. We had a good time while visiting Las Vegas. The pools were being cleaned but that happens this time of year
30,Bell desk service needs to improve it was a free for all to who got service next even though there was a line of people waiting to get help. Seemed under staffed. checkin line was very long need more staff to help out.
40,Check in went smoothly. The room was clean and spacious. We rearranged a little to make the scooter for mom easy to pull into the room charge and turn around. Our room was #4594 in the Augustus tower. It was at the end of the hall making it a straight in straight out maneuver. The bathroom was large with a walk in shower jetted tub dual sink and private potty. There were two queen sized beds a lounge area and table and chairs. By almost perfect there were just a couple of things I found inconvenient for our stay. There is no microwave in the room. The refrigerator is loaded with product and there is a $75 personal use fee if you want to use the refrigerator for some leftovers or bottled water. Half of the counter top was dedicated to the snack bar and the bell hop mentioned that if you move something for 30 seconds there is an automatic charge to your room. So beware before you curiously start reading reach box while waiting for the bell hop. The hotel and casino are centrally located on the strip so I recommend if you have the chance to stay give it a shot. The machines were not very nice to us so we had the option to go to Paris Cromwell Flamingo Ball's or Harrah's without too much trouble.
50,room was great and spacious staff was friendly and helpful lots of restaurants and things to do around the hotel I found the staff at check in extremely helpful service was great and always considerate
50,Recommend for sure was a wonderful stay and really enjoyed everything caesars hd to offer. Best place on the strip hands down dont go anywhere else it wont even compare to what you experience here. Thanks for everything
50,The room was very nice and clean I was disappointed as a Diamond Plus card holder that their wasnt complimentary coffee and water in the room. The signage in the areas could be clearer it's a huge place and easy to get turned around
10,Joanna in room service was racist and very rude. She got upset as I was using speakerphone that was provided by caesars palace. And used inappropriate tone and language. I will never stay in caesars palace ever again. I reported to the room service manager and hotel manager marquis as well but they are too big to care or apologize or compensate
50,Had a wonderful stay and experience with our stay at Caesar's Palace. Staff was friendly and helpful and the facility was beautiful. Went to see Mariah Carey and enjoyed the show alot. Was disappointed that the show started 1 hour late but performance was great particularly if you are a Mariah Carey fan. Restaurant choices offer alot of good tasty options but as you would expect from a high end resort prices were high. We were celebrating a 60th birthday and ate at several restaurants including Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill and the Baccannal buffet. Both were great but not cheap
30,We had fun  Hotel wasn‚Äôt what we expected but overall it was ok  unfortunately not great  the parking situation was horrible! It is expected in Vegas but we had to walk with our luggage a long way  without any direction
50,Experience was class act. We will defiantly be coming back and telling friends to go to caesars. From checking in to having bags delivered and all the fantastic shops and food right onsite. Very clean and we are coming back
50,Best location clean rooms and always the best vibe in the casino. So many great restaurants to choose from and walking distance to all major casinos. Great entertainment and shopping on the property. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. We have stayed at almost every casino on the strip and Caesars is always our favorite.
40,"It is a huge hotel/casino. Pretty decent rooms with much of space. A little bit hassle with some weird minibar bills when checking out but they were quickly removed when leaving. Casino area is not the place to go with teenagers (or anyone under 21) security will remove them quickly (and not always on the most polite way). When leaving I went to check out and left daughters waiting with bags on area that I thought was not ""casino-area"". When I came back they were not there as security had removed them. It took some 15 mins to find them and luckily my girls were smart enough to find me from original spot."
20,The room was nice the service was great clean GREAT LOCATION and good sleep quality. However there was 1 big thing : AIR QUALITY in the casino. Cigarette smoke was overwhelming. Ended up gambling at other casinos.
50,We arrived on a very crowded Friday night in LV after a cross country flight with no sleep the night before to attend a conference. Somehow our reservations for four nights got lost in the system. (Booked through a third party). We were afraid to be turned away but Salvador A. came to our rescue! He not only was able to get us a room but a beautiful corner suite with a view of Bellagio fountains on one side and the mountains on the other. The room was gorgeous. Very clean and large. Very comfortable bed and two thermostats (yes the room was that big). The location was great and we look forward to returning in a few months.
40,I was put in a Beautiful Suite after the small suite i had Booked was rented to a conference. YES upgraded to 15 th floor on Julius Tower Can only gain entrance to that floor with a key Only negative thing about room was that their was a fridge but no room for anything because it was stocked with Beerwine beverages & liquor Had a coffee machine but no coffee 4 pods were $14.98. I loved Room & amenities outside of fridge & coffee
20,After our trip..Caesars asked for feedback. I gave it hoping they might try to make one little thing right..they responded nicely and timely .however just got a sorry please try us again. We are not high rollers or rewards members was not expecting much just a nice place to stay. our non smoking room was the first room off the elevator with all the smoke coming up through the elevator shaft it didn't smell anything but a smoking room and the view was of a concrete wall with an exposed pipe.Yes if you walked to the far corner of the room you could see out.. that was actually nothing we were going to mention here.. it's the little thing...Before our trip we were asked if we had any questions..asked a few.. but this one...asked about early check in..was told sure the charge would be $30..fine..at check in was told that would be $50sorry that's an old price you will be charged $50..after showing the e-mail from the day before Yep..Still $50....Sometimes it is just the little stuff.....and definitely the principal of the thing....
10,"I booked online with an offer that included a $175 ""Resort Credit"". Whe I checked in I was told the credit could be applied to the $50 per day resort fee that would be charged to my room. Well checkout day arrives and guess what? Resort fees are strill on my room summary and when I asked about the credit they told me that it could NOT be applied to the resort fees.    I could have spent the $175 dollars on a nice dinner or perhaps a show at the hotel bud due to the bad information I was provided by the hotel staff the credit went unused.    Needless to say I will not be returning to this property which lures you in with false offers. Too many other great ptoperties in Vegas to choose from that do not practice this bait and switch approach with their guests."
50,Just want to recognize Julia H for her help with check-in at Caesar‚Äôs. She was so kind and went above and beyond to expedite my check-in process! This is my favorite place to stay in Vegas and she made it better! :)
50,When my husband checked in on Saturday February 282020 he was helped by Bryan. On this busy day Bryan did a fantastic job offering a room upgrade. Normally the checkin process is frustrating but Caesar‚Äôs (Bryan) have made it a positive experience.    We came back to the desk to add parking in the garage to our room key and again the staff provided five star service.    The room is spacious with a wonderful view. Magdalena our house keeper was so cheerful and was already done with our room so early.    I am not sure what happened here at Caesar‚Äôs in the last two years but I can attest the service has gone from a 3.5 to 5 stars.    Well done!
50,Our hotel room was great! I checked in online and went to the kiosk to pick up my keys upon arrival. This made the check in process great.  I would recommend that you review your charges upon leaving. I was charged for using the mini bar in the room which I didn‚Äôt. The front desk clerk adjusted the error immediately.
40,It was so beautiful I was able to see Lisa Vanderpump‚Äôs new restaurant I am a big fan we just found Caesars very expensive but very clean rooms were very clean and beautiful and very helpful and nice people that work there were
50,We have been Caesars Rewards (Total Rewards) members for over 20 years but never stayed at Caesars Palace before. Although we did experience many venues during our Vegas visit Caesars Palace offered everything we wanted and more in one place and as we are seniors with limited mobility that is a godsend.  We booked all of our shows through their awesome friendly concierge service and highly recommend using it.
50,Best Place to take out of town friends and family. Hotel rooms are beautiful clean and safe. All the best places to shop are located here at this hotel. Caesars Palace is located in the center of the Las Vegas strip. The casino is large located in the center of everything.
50,Awesome hotel! Great Rooms! Tons of food and beverage options to choose from! Food court employees were a little slow. Cocktail service was a 10! Was there for Mariah Carey concert and she was awesome as usual!
50,Great stay overall. We arrived late so the line at the front desk was wasn‚Äôt busy. Throughout my stay I‚Äôd walk by and there was always a long line. They also have a set of quick check in kiosks but i didn‚Äôt use them. I requested a handicap accessible room for my mother. They gave me a regular room. I had called a week earlier and confirmed that I had the room. However when I checked in they only had an accessible room with a king bed which was not going to work for us. They accommodated us with a shower chair and that was sufficient for us. Everyone at Caesars was awesome and friendly. We rented a motorized scooter and the bell desk was very nice when I picked it up and when I dropped it off. The room was nice and clean. Tiny but it worked. The only real gripe I have is the resort fee. It cost just as much as the nightly rate for the room. I mean it‚Äôs Vegas so I get it. But it hurt my wallet. The staff at the spa were fantastic as well.
10,Where to start.......no assistance with our luggage on arrival advised by front desk we were 3 hours early for check in but we could be accommodated for a fee of $USD50 plus tax which we accepted on the back of a 20 hour flight from Australia asked if we required housekeeping for our 2 night stay as we ‚Äòshould be mindful of the planet‚Äô offered no directions or assistance to find our room (we wandered around for 30 minutes asking 3 staff for directions) but the worst was yet to come .... the room!!! It stunk of cigarettes the furniture was shabby uncared for and outdated. The electric blinds did not work nor did the light for the makeup mirror. Don‚Äôt housekeeping check anything?? This was a first too....... the wardrobe was in the bathroom. Really??? We paid AUD700 for 2 nights of torture in the Forum Tower. This is a ZERO STAR review. Management should be ashamed of themselves.
10,Had the hotel provided Tigers and Chickens in our room it would have been an upgrade from this dump. The check in was a joke. We arrived from a 20 hour trip from Australia and though early it was a $50 plus tax offer to check in 3 hours early which was 4pm. We were asked if we did not want service to save the planet! I guess they have run out of towels and maids. We were pointed to walk through the casino to get to the elevators which took us over a half an hour to find. This place is a dive. We paid $700 for a room that had a view of the back of a building. The electric drapes did not work. The furniture looked like it came from the Salvation Army. The lighted mirror in the bathroom did not work. People had OBVIOUSLY SMOKED in the room. The concierge was never there. The elevators has graffiti scratched into the walls. The carpets needed to be ripped out. This room and hotel is a joke. Never again. Ever!  I‚Äôd rather have pizza from Little Caesars. This place is a disgrace.  PS: This is a ZERO STAR REVIEW.
50,Had an excellent time staying at Caesars. Room was nice and quiet. check-in was quick and concierge very helpful. Like the central location. Only negative was it took some time for an attendant to help fix my slot machine when it quit working.
50,We had the pleasure of staying in the Augustus tower in Caesars for 5 nights. This is the best hotel I have ever stayed in. The room was spotless we had a cracking view over the strip and Bellagio fountains and were quite high up too. The bathroom was marble with a jacuzzi bath. Rooms were cleaned daily. There's a great vibe in the place everyone seems happy to be there. It had everything. Coming back to Vegas next year and after visiting all hotels on the strip will definitely be staying in Caesars again. 5* 10/10 well done guys!
50,We stayed in the Julius tower and it was a great experience. The hotel was beautiful huge and after a few go around staying easy to navigate. We would definitely stay there again. We went to see Mariah Carey perform and were able to go into the venue and buy our merch early then re-enter once the show was going to start. So great!
20,VERY poor customer service. No communication between departments.  Rivers of people (customers) getting in and out of the lobby. You have to be willing to do the job for each department if you have a problem during your stay. They won‚Äôt make any calls or transfer calls for you at all.    Clearly this hotel doesn‚Äôt need new customers it looks like they want to get rid of some... sad.    Been to the Paris twice mandalay bay once Elara once Wynn twice and I have NEVER experienced such a poor service like this in Vegas no one should. It always been a ‚Äúdream‚Äù to stay at the Caesars I guess because of its appearance and ‚Äúreputation‚Äù¬ø?... glad to say it was the last time.
50,Loved everything about Caesars Palace. Location restaurants and rooms. Large and spread out lots of walking. Wish I could have stayed longer. It was my first time in Vegas and Caesars made it special.
30,I choose to stay at Caesars Palace since I was going to see a concert there as well and have always wanted to try out the hotel. For being a 5 star hotel I was very disappointed in the little things and will never stay here again.  I stayed in Palace Premium (newly renovated i might add) room.  First thing...the house keeping left toilet paper pieces on the bathroom floor.  Second thing...What is the point of a rainfall shower head if the water pressure is terrible? Choose not to wash my hair since I knew the water pressure wasn't good enough to rinse my hair.  Third thing...NO BATHROBE! I have never stayed in 5 star hotel that didn't have a bathrobe (called front desk to check bathrobe doesn't come with room)  Forth Thing...No usb plug. Newly renovated room with no USB not even in the lamp(called front desk i was told i can purchase in gift shop)  Fifth Thing...No complimentary coffee or water I could purchase from mini bar only...4 coffee pods for $25 with a couple packs of sugar and creamer. Not even the good cream but a powder pack  Highway Robbery  speaking of mini bar. room doesn't have separate fridge and if you choose to use mini bar fridge for personal use it's a $70 fee  Sixth Thing...The 24 hours restaurant was closed that night at 10pm for maintenance..After an event? You couldn't close it after midnight? forced to order room service since other restaurants were closed except fast food in food court.  Another thing was the parking...alot of the Vegas hotel now charge for parking even for guest which to me is ridiculous it was $18 and super far from front desk then elevators to room were far from check in. Not convenient with lots of luggage.  The only good thing I'll say is the jetted tub was amazing .
30,Seems dated and somewhat tired. We often stay at Bellagio and were expecting more from Caesers this is one of the top resorts in this group. We had stayed here many years ago and had a much better experience. Not an easy task to compete with Bellagio.
40,Just ok. Rooms were nice. Casino too big and separated too much traffic to and from Forum and shops. Long walk to rooms lots of smoke construction around entrance poker room dealers seemed to be slow and not informed. Had rude let it ride dealer.
50,Played slots and poker tourneys. Place was extremely clean. Food court was clean as well. Food was good but was a little pricey as I had a burger and tots from smash burger. Had a good variety of slots and poker tourneys were well ran
50,Over looking the fountains is wonderful we will be back soon. The property has many many different areas of interest there is always something to do or go the property is always clean and exciting. we are already planing our next visit maybe longer next time we will see what our schedule will allow.
50,We went to Vegas to go to the Nascar Race. We had a great time at Caesar's. We thoroughly enjoyed the Buffet. This is a must do if you stay here.    The rooms we had were clean well maintained and we loved it.
50,We stayed here for a family staycation and had a great time. Service was excellent and there was plenty of activities besides gaming for our family to participate in. We will be staying as often as we can. Our room had an amazing view.
50,We have stayed here a couple of times. The rooms are large and clean. Great service at check-in.  Easy valet gets you in and out. If your here on the weekends do expect a little extra time.  Food here is pricey just like the rest of Vegas. You do get good food.  I found the beds on the soft side. This location is on the strip and close to a lot of activities. The food court is always busy and also has great food.  If Starbucks is busy just go around the corner and there is another coffee shop. If your a Diamond member you can skip the regular line and go to the Diamond line.  When in Vegas rent a car and travel out the Valley of Fire.
40,Great service and atmosphere. Friendly dealers and waitresses. I have been to Vegas about 8 times now I come twice a year and every time I come to Vegas I always make sure to visit Ceasers Palace. Love the atmosphere and the friendly service.
50,My husband and I were traveling through Vegas and stopped at Ceasers. We played for an extremely long time the facility was unbelievably clean restrooms were the cleanest I had seen in all of Vegas I just can't wait to get back down to Vegas and possibly stay at Ceasers.
10,My room was next to the a/c fan and it ran 24/7. I was unable to get any sleep. Spoke with someone at front desk the first night the only response I received was I‚Äôm sorry. Room 989 is to noisy for guest. Also was charged $45.00 for snacks and coffee I did not use. This was our first and last time staying at Caesars.
20,"For the amount of $ spent there Re just no amenities none none noe ripoff none none overpriced and not very honest. And if I need to say more then you are st.""..........unbelievBle how you make everyone make"
50,We were upgraded to Octavia tower - floor 66. It was spacious for the 4 of us and we loved our view of the pool. The casino and hotel were spotless.  We didn't gamble much since we had teens with us but they enjoyed spending our money in the forum shops! The restaurants were all great and we especially liked the ease and variety of the food court.  The room was ready for 3 people upon arrival but housekeeping quickly brought towels and accessories for the 4 of us. On our 3rd day the toilet wouldn't flush but maintenance took care of that immediately upon notification. He even noticed a vanity bulb that was out and changed that too.  Caesars being in the middle of the strip was a great location for us. We look forward to a return trip and the same wonderful hospitality from check-in to check-out.
50,We played here more then anywhere on the strip it was fun and my mom won! The place is like a maze at times but that might be cause it was a busy weekend. Hotel looks so nice we plan on staying here for sure next time.
50,This Place is Phenomenal. It‚Äôs Hugh And Epic . Loads of Phenomenal Restaurants. Great Food Court offers large selection of different foods. They Have a Great and Hugh Mall of high end stores inside . Two Cigar shops inside  a Montechristo Lounge and CasA Fuente. You can Honestly Stay here for a Week and Never Have to Leave the Hotel . They Offer Shows dining  Poker Cigars Etc. Overall Great Place and Great Rooms . Located on a Great Spot on the Strip too . Highly Highly Recommend.
50,Best poker room on the strip! Reward system is superior to all the rest. Recommend a visit if you prefer 1-2 no limit Texas Hold 'em. Staff is exceptional always willing to help. Room is well lit always busy and well run.
50,Stayed at Augustus tower. Great view of Bellagio fountain show. Great hotel and casino. We got connected rooms in the Augustus tower and my family was pleased with the location and convenience of the room. Will come back again.
30,Our room was located at the Octavious tower. Perfect location and it was over looking at their beautiful pool area.rooms are very roomy. The boy downfall was our room had that bad odor called pot smellüòÖ
50,This hotel is located in the middle of the strip and close to everything. We have attended several concerts at the Zappo Theater and we love ythe size of the room especially the jet tub in the bathroom.
50,Caesars was a great place to stay it had a lot of amenities for me to enjoy all of the frequent games I like to play. There was always room in the poker area and I love being at the sportsbook the food is great too!
30,Room very hot which made it hard to get a good night sleep. Room refrigerator cost an additional $75 for personal use. K-Cups to have coffee in room was $14.99. Nothing was complimentary. Too expensive
20,Caesers is no longer what it once was- still call themselves a luxury resort but compared to the competition they don‚Äôt measure up  No early check in. Then left waiting until 4:20 when I demanded a room  Put in a terrible one with scratched up fur stirs and decor from the 1970‚Äôs  Twice during the visit at two different casino floor public rest rooms I had to alert a security guard that the stalls were filthy and there was no paper towels in them. The resort fees have gotten out of hand  $50 + for what?  I will stay elsewhere from now on  Too bad - I used to love it here
30,If you want to be relentlessly charged for everything then hit Caesars Palace. We were told one pool was open there was none. $50 resort fee is outrageous everything is extra. Want to use a hot tub extra! Parking Extra! More then 2 wifi devices is an extra $15/day. While gambling never once did anyone offer us drink in 8 days of playing there. Don't touch the mini bar in the room one of the cleaners knocked over a bag of cookies and we were billed $14.09 for them. There is no place to just sit down and have a coffee unless you're at a slot machine$$$. Place is very crowed outside should get rid os some circus tents and open up some space. They seem to be trying to rent out ever sq ft of space. Things like railing trim missing or held on with duct tape in some of the outside areas. Railings in elevator were also missing with the bolt sticking out. We will never stay here again prices are high and service on the floor is low.    The real highlight of the visit was Gordon Ramsey's restaurant stay somewhere else and visit Hells Kitchen!
50,I had anxiety because I had to attend a business conference with my 93 year old father. The agent Tangela was a true blessing she was patient calm knowledgeable and kind to us at check in. She shared vital information about benefits of my father being a platinum member in order to make parking more convenient due to his mobility challenges. She also suggested scooter rental. The room was amazing my dad was able to rest well with the beds provided in our room. Thank you so much Caesars Palace for the Amazing customer service that we received during our entire stay. We will be back.
50,I had a wonderful 4 night stay. Great location and really nice staff. The food and restaurant are amazing. Amber Nadeau is the best employee in the organization. I really enjoyed the spa. The salon was just ok for me. Maybe just the colorist/stylist. The pool was closed but will open soon and this really is one of the best pools on the strip. I am heading back for my next visit next week and can't wait. Thank you to the entire staff for a great stay.
50,Visited Casino & played Video poker Staff very friendly & attentive. Asked for directions & was helped. Bar tenders asked to help us before we had to wave at them. Casino very clean would visit again.
50,A lot of action on the table game Dealers are very professional in the highroller room. I prefer the caucasian dealers like Mark Larry and Sam. and some asian dealers especially Ms. Thi. She is awesome. I enjoy the whole trip and will be back again. Thank you for a great experience. Ceasar Palace.
10,Room was crapy key was not working twice come to find out the lock on the door not working had the worst experience with this hotel customer service talks to you like they don‚Äôt care they give attitude ..it was my husband birthday it got ruined bc we could not get into our room... it was raining got wet  went to the room to change and lock not working they give credits but they could have done better ... I will not recommend this hotel..
10,"On January 13 2020 two of us called Caesar's Hotel reservations and talked with Mary to make a reservation for two rooms. We told her the dates that we wanted in February that we wanted to be in adjoining rooms and that we wanted to be in the most recently updated tower at the hotel. She told us that the newest tower was Julius and that we would be in adjoining rooms.    On arrival at 4:00 p.m. we found that we were in two different towers which is not what we requested. We were told when we tried to check in that we couldn't check in until 6:00 we had event reservations at 7:00 p.m. In addition we were told that Julius was not the most updated tower that Palace was newly renovated and we could check in to that tower right then. But that would require an upgraded room charge per night of $50. This is a bait and switch tactic. And a lie by the front desk person as well...Julius is indeed the newest tower! I was to get a king room but ended up with two queens. The room was not top quality...lots of scratches gouges the shower door did not close the carpet was torn the drapes would not close.    On the last night of our stay starting at 10:30 and continuing until 2:00 there was banging from next door so severe that the bed shook. It was not a guest room it was marked Staff. I called about this several times...the calls go to a call center at Harrah's. If you want to actually talk to someone in Caesar's you have to go downstairs to the front desk. At one point about 1:30 a.m. I encountered a security guard coming out of the Staff room and when I inquired about the noise he said ""they have to work.""    The charge for the room was not removed by Caesar's...they refunded the resort fees...seriously???    Stay somewhere else. I recommend the Encore...the people there are quite professional and are serious about ensuring quality care."
50,We stayed at e-card palace and we had a great time the rooms are huge and beautiful with the best view of the strip the jacuzzi and showers had gold knobs and trim the mini bar was fully stocked and the room service was on point
50,I have always been very pleased with the service of the staff and would like to recognize Michelle A at the Diamond registration for being very helpful.  I have been very happy with my comps and hope it doesn‚Äôt change now that Eldorado have taken ownership of Caesars Entertainment.
20,Rooms are very old and do not seem very clean shops are great food is great staff is willing to help. For someone looking for a higher end experience I do not recommend Ceasars. This is a very high volume tourist location and that is not what we enjoy in Vegas.
40,Arrived at Caesar's after a long 2 days of driving from Canada. Went to the check-in desk and was processed quickly. Maria S. did a great job in making sure our check-in went smoothly also answering questions about the casino and products they offer. She also kindly upgraded our room quite unexpectedly. We ended up in room 1603 in Palace Tower. The room vista was to the back of the Mirage and towards the mountains to the NW of Vegas.    The room itself was really nice. It was kept very clean by the cleaning staff. This is super important for me. So many hotels feel dumpy because they are not cared for adequately. This was not the case at Caesar's. There were always people caring for the facility and the grounds.    Back to the room...it came with a jet tub and separate shower and a dual sink vanity. The stocked fridge was a nice extra for someone just arriving on the strip. The room was very spacious and filled our needs well.    I was fortunate to speak with Angel U. and employee of Caesar's that provided some fantastic history of Las Vegas and prudent advice for a day trip of hiking in the desert. If I didn't talk to Angel it would have been a very uncomfortable day. Big thanks to him!    I used the self-park for parking the car. With the parking fees being attached to the room it was super slick to come and go from the parking structure. You simply tapped your rfid room card on the entrance and exit equipment and up went the arm. It is best to be familiar with the roads around Caesar's if using the self park so you can find the entrance to the self park quickly. There is a road on the backside of Caesar's that made going to and from easier than going down the strip. Pedestrian traffic as well as car traffic made driving in Vegas interesting.    Overall I can't say enough good things about Caesar's. I will definitely go back.    The cons:    - the pool area was closed. If you are looking to sit by a pool I would recommend calling the casino and asking them directly so you won't be disappointed.    -Caesar's restaurants and shops seemed to be pricey. I am not sure what I was expecting but a little cheaper would have been better. If you are trying to do Vegas on a budget I would still suggest staying at Caesar's and even gambling at Caesar's (the casino was amazing!) but you can eat at another restaurant close by.
40,We checked in on a Tuesday and was upgraded to a beautiful Room with a View in the Augustus Tower. All of their restaurants were really good and it wasn't till our last day there the system went down so no reward cards or tickets were working. So unfortunately we left for the airport early.
10,It was New Years Eve. If there is a time that a hotel in Vegas should be on their game knowing it will be very busy it‚Äôs NYE. Our room didn‚Äôt cleaned we called for towel and were told there were none! If we wanted to use the fridge there was a 75.00 charge per day! This was a $550.00/ per night room. Everything was on a sensor If we lifted anything we were charged. Coffee pods were 4.00 / each! Such a money grab!
20,The good: The room is nice and big. It seems clean and the shower has lots of pressure.    The bad: The check-in process is a joke! As soon as I landed there was an email asking me to check in online and provide them my credit card info. I did that and received a message to go to the kiosk upon arrival. We arrived around 9am and I really didn‚Äôt expect to have a room ready at that point. The kiosk said I would receive an email when my room was ready. At 4pm I finally went to the front desk to ask about a room. The lady said ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt receive a text?‚Äù First neither the kiosk nor the email asked for a phone number. Second would I have waited 7 hours if I had received any kind of notification that my room was ready?    Others in our group had similar issues. Apparently they have no idea what they are doing. When I come back in August I‚Äôll stay at Mandalay Bay.
50,We like to stay at nice & beautiful Caesar Palace caused their room are big with separate shower stall& bath tub w/air jet. massage. There are a lot of table & slot machines on casino floor. We enjoyed our Valentine trip here.
50,The room location was great the decor it was very clean and very easy to get to it while going up or down my wife and I really love the Julius Tower because it is central and don't have to many floor's plus the service was was great.
50,Rooms in the plaza tower are in a great location. The rooms are truly comfortable and give a sense of peace after a busy day hanging out on the strip. Make sure to visit Mr Chow for happy hour. Great apps and 1/2 price drinks
10,We used the quick check-in at 10am at 4:30pm we had to beg to get a room. When we got to our room and called the Bell desk to have our bags delivered it took 45 minutes to get them. We had to cancel our dinner reservations do to this supposed high-end hotel. It's an absolute ZERO!!!! Make sure you find somewhere else on the strip. I mean anywhere!!!!
40,Great location the newly remodeled room is great. Staffs are very nice.We‚Äôve stayed in this hotel many times and it offers everything you need for Vegas. The buffet and Hell‚Äôs Kitchen are great but definitely pricey . Will return in the future for sure
10,I travel to Vegas 10-12 times a year and this was my first stay at Caesar‚Äôs.  They were not flexible on check in time where other properties are always accommodating. Went to eat brunch and came back about 11am to a cleaning lady already done with my room and i could not use the shower checkout is not until noon. Mold growing on the drywall above the shower (Julius Tower 1177). Will pay more to stay at a better property moving forward.
50,Between the Bacchanal buffet and Old Homestead steakhouse you'll eat like a king!! Great Sportsbook also. For as large and beautiful as the property is the pricing seems to be in line with expectations. Do yourself a favor and get the Caesars Rewards credit card!!
50,We always have a pleasant visit. The property is always clean and well staffed. The Octavius tower with the pool view is our favorite tower. It's in the perfect area for us. The Bacchanal is a must everytime we visit.
50,Amazing experience. Recommend to everyone.This was one of the best trips I‚Äôve ever been on in my life. I recommend everybody who has not been on a cruise to come to this one because they will treat you like one of your own. I really love this me and my wife really enjoyed it.
50,Amazing and awesome experience! The room is very comfortable and fascinating you feel you are in a palace as a king Everybody... you are treated as royalty. Everything...you feel you are in your kingdom.
40,Spent three comped nights at Ceasars. We used the auto check in on my phone and the lobby kiosks to check in. The process worked great. The kiosk printed out room number and tower location and then created the plastic rooms keys. Done in 5 minutes which was good since the check-in line looked to be 20‚Äî30 minutes. An employee Dany was there to assist if needed. We stayed in the Forum Tower - their low roller rooms. Room was clean and nice ‚Äì similar to Paris or New York. View was strip but partially blocked but great center strip location. Since we knew that picking any up items on the counter or in the fridge would trigger a purchase we were careful not to touch anything. But did decide to purchase the in room coffee and glad we did. $9 total cost for three days worth of in room coffee. We play mostly the slots and drink service was excellent. Someone came by very 5-10 minutes. We didn‚Äôt have much luck but since we‚Äôve been coming to Vegas for 25 years that can happen any time at any casino. After check-in I received an email from Ivy a personal assistant to answer any questions. We only had a couple but Ivy was quick and complete with answers. The only restaurant we ate on property was an old favorite The Cheese Cake Factory in Forum Shops. Love the restaurant located just behind the moving statues. Check out was smooth and quick. The only reason they don‚Äôt get max stars is the resort fee - $50 a day. This continues to be a customer disservice that most of the strip hotels charge. Otherwise an excellent stay at Ceasars.
40,Room was very nice and clean. Staff very helpful in providing information to local attractions and type of transportation. Good selection of restaurants. While the restaurants were good...they are pretty expensive..there is a food court with OK food ..but a little overpriced for the quality.
50,Another wonderful stay at the palace!!!! this is by far the best venue on the strip. Great rooms great food and best of all is the service!!! It ended up raining one of the days we stayed and spent hours in the forum looking through the various shops. We now add 'shopping' to the must do list1
40,Caesars Palace has lost the shine it use to have but it is still Caesars nonetheless. There are other cooler newer and fancier casinos in Las Vegas that try harder with better customer service better restaurants and slicker casinos. Give them a try first.
50,We had a great time at the casino. It was very clean. You could hardly notice people were smoking unless they were right beside you. All of the dealers we dealt with were friendly and knowledgeable. Even though there were a lot of people at this location it did not seem crowded.
50,Beautiful rooms excellent food ambiance and a variety of gaming choices. The brunch at the Bacchanal buffet was exceptionally delicious. There are two Starbucks location within Caessrs as well as an essentials store along with many other shops.
50,Really great place to stay with all the amenities you could ask for. I will be sure to stay here again in the near future. The only thing I wish could be different is the parking situation. Pretty standard compared to other locations but If you are staying there should be free....
20,When your salary is paid by the one you service you should treat them better. A host should understand the meaning the definition of the word. I so sad to say this was my favorite hotel and I always felt that Caesars went out of there way to see they met your needs.
50,We stayed at a pet-friendly room which was clean and had enough space for my 4-legged child. Everything was simply great especially the quality of room service food. We will certainly come back to Caesars Palace!
50,Visit Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas! It's a great place to relax and enjoy your time in this fabulous city. The CP staff is focused on customer service and will make your stay one to remember. The restaurants are great--something for everyone the shows here and at the other Caesar's properties provide something fun for everyone and the dealers at the tables are really great. Our room was large and beautiful and we don't ever sleep anywhere as well as we do here!
50,As always the best place to stay in Vegas. Location and amenities put Caesars over the top for us. The Forum shops offer world class shopping the restaurants are top notch and the entertainment goes without saying.
50,We went there because they offered us. Free rooms and some Casino play my wife and I had a great time. We enjoyed every aspect of you Casino. As well as a dining. We were able to catch the Mariah Carey concert. And she sang beautifully. I also want a couple jackpots while there. That's always a plus. Will definitely go back.
20,I was in town for a wedding with my family and booked a 2 queen palace premium room and was told that only a king room was available and they offered to bring me a roll away bed and move my room the next day but who wants to switch room in the middle of their trip when they are only there for a weekend? Also we had a wedding to attend the next day. So they agreed to waive their resort fees but when got to my room it was not the same room type as i had booked. It was a Julius tower king from which is smaller and would book for anywhere from $30-50 less per night. When I called they said i had to go to the front desk which had a huge line of people waiting. It was incredibly frustrating. On top of this while getting ready for the wedding someone came to check the minibar? FYI the minibar is locked and can‚Äôt be opened unless you call the front desk. No idea what that was about as we never even touched it. The whole experience was disappointing as we did nit get the room we booked and it was difficult to even speak to someone about the issues. Also i was told that when i booked and paid for the room it was a request but they were not required to give us this room. My room was facing a wall and i could hear the people next us.
50,Had a week stay here in feb and it was an awesome experience.The food hotel room and amenities were beyond my expectation.  Casino was over crowded as Caesars was hosting multiple conferences at that time.
10,3 different rooms in the 3 days we were there for our anniversary we‚Äôre all like this we spent the trip moving rooms and luggage with no bellhop help We upgraded to a nicer room with a tub and this is what we received
10,I stayed 1 night there but I got charge 2 time for parking fee $18 each. I told the front desk that I got to pay $18 when I left the first time and he said when you leave for check out you won't need to pay again they scan the license tag but when I left in the morning I inserted the ticket and it asked me to pay another $18 so I click on hte help button on the box and they said I got to pay nothing they can do about it and they hung up.
40,Our first time in Vegas from the UK so the review has no standards to compare with. Check in was straightforward and efficient if a little cold. The room pre-booked through travel agent at home in Augustus Tower was excellent. Clean and comfortable. Would have expected shower gel in the bathroom as well as the provided shampoo and body lotion but the bar of soap was an adequate substitute. Shocked at the $14 cost of a coffee sachet only ever provided free in hotels at home so declined and used Starbucks at the bottom of the lifts. A popular choice given the length of lines around breakfast time. Steered well clear of the minibar after looking at the price list. Housekeeping was good and anonymous.  Found the concierge service (Barbara) excellent. Friendly interested and very helpful.  The Forum shops after the initial overwhelming introduction were amazing. Excellent choice and the presence of security/street assistants meant the atmosphere felt safe and very pleasant for browsing. The downside and a huge shock to 2 innocent Brits abroad was the fact that smoking is allowed inside the hotel and the walk to and from room to shops and eateries meant 10 minutes in a fug from which our clothes never recovered. I would like to have lingered a while and watched some of the games and played the slots but the air was just too unpleasant. Not unique to Caesar‚Äôs as subsequently discovered so no fault there really. It would be a brave decision for the first casino to ban this filthy habit.  Check out was online and very easy. Tax was added to the resort fee although our booking clearly stated the cost included tax but this was readily sorted by a desk clerk.  Las Vegas was for us just a launch pad to see the Grand Canyon but enjoyed the stay overall. If we did come back we would certainly consider Caesar‚Äôs again.
30,There is no personal interaction anymore. Everything is done via text. No free coffee in the room! Bring your own K-cup pods or pay $14 from the mini bar in your room! Ridiculous! Pools weren‚Äôt open. People from Minnesota would have liked to at least SIT by the pool in the sun! It was 70 degrees! What did i pay $51 a day resort fee for? Wifi was only thing!!
40,Hotel was beautiful. The Palace room was okay. Nothing special but to be fair we were not in it a lot. You can't beat the location to the strip and all the action. Definitely one of the nicest hotels but also one of the most expensive.
50,I had an amazing weekend!! Front service on top notch and room service excellent.felt save and comfortable drinking a couple of drinks also the design inside Caesars palace and the foundation and the forum stores worth everything.
20,Stayed 4 nights in Las Vegas in 3 different hotels. Decided to get a splurge on last night and get a fancy room. But had a disappointing stay at Caesars Palace. Booked for a strip view room thinking that I will get to see the Bellagio fountains. Instead all we could see was the roof of their huge hotel. No free parking. Loooong check-in lines. Horrible smoking smell in room. Had to go down and request for a different one. WiFi didn‚Äôt work. Cannot get cell reception in room. Parking garage is so far... it takes like 20 minutes to get to the room. No microwave in room. Refrigerator has no room for your personal items. If you put something in there is $75 charge. Mini bar in room is a rip off. Small can of Pringles is almost $10. Requested for a little late check out but they rudely denied. Already paid $18 for parking but when exiting the garage it still said $18 balance due. Overall didn‚Äôt find the atmosphere very friendly and inviting like some of the other hotels. Would rather stay at Planet Hollywood with free parking and the Miracle Mile mall location connecting the hotel is excellent. Also we really liked the Signature at MGM luxury condo. We had room # 26-609 which was amazing.
20,"I stayed at Ceasars 5 years ago and it was a wonderful experience I would never forget. I returned this last week to take advantage of a promotional 2 night stay with my wife son and niece. Our checkin process was wonderful. We got upgraded to a suite for $75 per night in addition to the resort fees. The next morning when I took a shower I noticed lots of hair and the drain was clogged causing the shower to flood. Informed the front desk and they sent engineering to take care of it (no big deal). The next morning there was no hot water. We informed the front desk and the operator suggested we go eat at the Americano Cafe while they worked on the issue. We not only had to get ready and head to the airport but she was not even offering a discount. The level of service from the staff was below average. This was not the hospitality that's expected when visiting Las Vegas.  Beds were not comfortable food options are not good if you want to grab a quick bite. There is a ""complimentary"" Keureg in the room but the coffee pods cost $14!  Do yourself a favor spend the extra money and stay at the Cosmopolitan.  They have the most comfortable beds and much better service.    ."
10,I have called Caesars twice about this and they agreed to give me credit for two items they charged me for items from the mini bar that we did NOT take nor touched but 4 weeks later and I still have not received the credit of $31.35. If they do this to ALL of their guests they are racking up on charges not accurate. The bad thing is they have the tray on top of the desk and if you even TOUCH it or lay anything on top of it they charge you! I will not stay there again for this reason! Bad way to treat your guest!
40,This was my second time to stay at Caesars Palace. Went with my brother on our annual trip. Stayed in the Octavius tower this time. The room was very spacious and comfortable. Nice size bathroom. The only minor complaint I have is the location of the air vent for the air conditioner. It faces away from the beds and the main area of the room so it does not cool the room very well but since it was February it wasn‚Äôt that bad. I believe it would be a problem in the summer months though. There are two hallways to the Octavius tower one takes you to the lobby and the other takes you by the pool and buffet into the casino. There are plenty of dining options on property as well a mall if shopping is your thing. Over all Caesars Palace is a nice property to stay at and the service from housekeeping on up was very good. I would definitely recommend it and stay here again.
50,Beds were very comfortable rooms are very spacious ;Loved the bathroom shower was great. Only thing I didn't like was a charge for the coffee per day. Also resort fee was kind of high. Lots & lots of walking especially for the elderly who have medical problems I feel the casinos on the strip are geared for the young.
50,Our room was a suite on the 45 th floor. We loved the view and bed was very comfortable. We loved the bathroom as well. Shower was awesome. We shall be back! I play cards and enjoyed how compassionate the dealers were. They were friendly and professional at the same time. Just wished I‚Äôd won more.
50,Caesars gave us adjoining room at the Forum tower with my kids and was very please because its a few minutes walk from the Forum mall. Rooms was very clean and lots of room. Bell service was very prompt in delivering our luggage as well as picking it up when we were checking out. Front desk was very nice and friendly always smiling. Looking forward to staying with Caesars again.
50,rooms are spacious clean and restaurants are amazing. Plus the location is awesome and on the strip which makes it easy to explore the area. I recommend eating Lemon Chicken at RAO's restaurant at CP. Yummy Italian food.
30,We have been staying at Caesars for years and this was such a disappointment. We tried a new room and it was very nice. Cool bathroom with a his and hers with a shower in between. We purposely booked it for the big bath and it had a loud leak so that was a bummer. Also after we went to bed the jets kicked back on for a few minutes and scared us. Also the motion lights in the closet came on multiple times and woke us up. We finally got up at midnight and found a switch to turn them off. Other than that room was nice and super quiet. The customer service was the real problem.....  We always get there early afternoon and don't have a problem getting a room. I know check in is 4 but we tried. They told us a room wasn't ready and wouldn't be until maybe even 6 o'clock.... we weren't happy at all. Finally got to the room about 4:30. We opted out of maid service and husband was told a $10 credit a day would be issued... nope $10 for the total stay. Then security came up and came into our room for a security check. We were totally fine with this as we understand safety security but we weren't told this would happen. The security guard was very nice and said the check in employee should have informed us of this... they didn't and he was very rude at check in anyway. We then had booked tickets to see Wayne Newton which has been on our to do list for years. I booked through the Caesars website but it redirects tou to Ticketmaster. I purposely got a love seat separately in the small venue as I have anxiety especially in crowds. When we went to enter the show they told us our seats are completely blocked by a pillar so they were moving us elsewhere.... why would you even sell those seats???? We were put right in the middle of the crowd and they just kept adding random chairs around us and moving people in. I have never seen a formal show do this. I had a major panic attack in the middle and had to step out. It was a horrible night after that. We called the next morning to let them know our concerns. We were told to call back later. We called back that night and after being shuffled around to 4 different people got the box office. He told us because we hadn't called to book it wasn't their problem and that we needed to call Ticketmaster. Their own sight directs you there!!!!!!!!! We really needed a nice relaxing vacation and for the most part didn't get it. The customer service as Caesars this trip was absolutely despicable. I don't know that we will be going back. I don't need to be treated horribly when I am paying a lot of money to stay at your hotel. They really need to train their customer service agents. Very upset with the whole process.
50,Stayed at this hotel before and have to say the second stay was just as great as the first! Caesars Palace is an icon on the strip and they've done a great job of hotel and casino upkeep. The rooms in the Palace Tower are nice and super big! Casino has all the games and the forum shops have been plenty of dining and shopping choices. Special mention to Christina who saw we were struggling at the self check-in kiosk and went out of her way to help us plus she was super friendly and funny! Highly recommend staying here location is perfect too (center strip).
40,Maid service was nonexistent üò° Two night stay vacated room during day no maid service. Nothing! On first arrival it the place was captivating. As we checked in at the kiosk we were aided by a nice young man who was most helpful. Our room was nice and met expectations. Only later did we get jilted by the maids. I‚Äôm simply amazed at this. $17 for a martini and then to cheap to direct maids to clean rooms. Next time in Las Vegas will be at Aria.
50,This was my first time in Vegas and I was expecting to absolutely hate it. Well I was completely wrong! I was there for a work conference and the staff at Caesars were absolutely amazing. So helpful and kind! The room was beautiful - I loved my soaking tub! We had dinner at the Asian cafe (can't remember the name) The Palm and the Vanderpump Cocktail Garden. The other meals were catered as part of the conference. Everything was fantastic! We had an event at the Omnia night club which was a great light show and dance event. We also saw the show at the hotel - Absinthe - and almost died of laughter. All in all it was a great trip and I would definitely come back!
50,We had a plumbing problem in our original king bed wing room in the palace tower. After maintenance came to our room and saw the extent of the problem we were upgraded to a place premium king suite that would rent for $1600 a night. I sincerely appreciated how they more than compensated us for the inconvenience of having to move rooms
50,Had a wonderful time at Caesars Palace for 1 week stayed in the Octavius Tower two queen room it was a little walk but we actually like the walk because it keeps us moving during the day for exercise. Really enjoyed the Americano Cafe which was open 24/7 we could always get a bite. Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill was top-notch and we love the Dionne Warwick show. My only suggestion is the Laurel Lounge could have a few more tables for the Diamond Plus and above players.
50,Went in just to play slots this time kiosk was very easy to use to get a new players card and the facilities were very clean as per usual. Waitress was quick and courteous when bringing my mimosa :-)
50,So our room was not as grand as the ‚ÄúHangover‚Äù suite but we had a 650 sqft  Room that over looked the Bellagio fountains. The view of the strip was excellent. The room was clean and large. The property is in the middle of the strip so if you do not mind walking it‚Äôs easy to go everywhere.
50,Our experience at Caesars was awesome. From our fabulous room to the great restaurants and the friendly staff. The only thing I would not do again is the breakfast buffet. That was a total waste of money and disappointing. Would have loved to go to the pool but we were there in February.
20,"I do not personally enjoy Las Vegas but have to stay there as a business traveler. In addition to the cigarette smoke which should have stopped being allowed decades ago this hotel has poor customer service and the personnel I've spoken to can be described as apathetic at best.    For example I was double charged for one night of my stay (their error not mine). After trying two different numbers and working through long automated systems the first of which only disconnected my call and never put me in touch with an agent I was told ""well you must have spoken to two different people that's why you were double charged"". A more appropriate response would be ""I'm sorry this has happened and I will correct it now."""
50,Caesar's Palace is a great place to really get away. We recently stayed in the Palace wing we stayed in the Augustus wing in the past. All of the rooms are spacious elegant and clean. The bathrooms are huge ours had a spa tub in addition to a shower. The staff is extremely friendly and there is a great variety of restaurant options.
50,Harrahs which owns Caesars was recently bought out by Eldorado. As with all acquisitions like this Eldorado will want a quick return on its investment. The quickest way to do that is to cut expenses which affects service quality. Caesars is a great place to spend some vacation time and hopefully new ownership won‚Äôt screw it up. Be prepared to stand up a lot. The only places to sit are at a slot machine  a bar or a restaurant.
10,Pool was closed which is unfortunate but understandable.    What was surreal is being charged $75 for having moved minibar items out of kids reach. They claim there was a placard prominently displayed. It wasn‚Äôt.    Crazy long term planning as had 5 people at the buffet dinner at Nobu etc. If not made right that will be at another resort next time.
20,Caesars used to be motivational in every way. Not anymore. Large variety but not like it used to be. For us the Wynn treats us much better very generous. Comped rooms great music clean and sadly Caesars used to be like that!
30,The food at Noodle 9 was wonderful. The interior of the casino looked a little tired and could use updating. The area where we were gambling was a tight fit and almost felt claustrophobic. The Breakfast at Americana I believe was delicious with great service from Juan.
50,Hands down the best property in Vegas to stay while in Vegas. Best food entertainment and staff. When considering all the hotel properties to stay while in Vegas we only choose Caesars Palace. Center of strip with access to all entertainment and food. Rooms are excellent and food is amazing.
50,Rooms are very spacious - Service was good all around and the food at Nobu was amazing. It was our first time dining at this restaurant our reservation was on time and they were also able to accommodate us in the spot that we wanted to sit at.
50,The rooms are fantastic must say bed was so comfortable. Love the walk in shower. Huge bathrooms!  Only thing if not in great physical shape this casino will be a challenge . Beautiful and big Top $$$ for food may want to eat at other locations. Food was good in food court still $$. Great location to get around on the strip!
40,Caesars is always fun to go to and play in the casino. Lots of slots to chose from and great places to eat.The Sports Book is huge and fun to sit and watch games there. My only complaint is that the cocktail service is always slow and takes 30 minutes to get a drink
50,The Casino was well aired with many options for slot machines restaurants were very good! The rooms in Octavia‚Äôs were spacious and newer very clean. The front desk especially the kiosk area the associates were very helpful
30,"Had a good but definitely not great stay. Always loved Caesars' vibe. The previous black gold and red lobby decor was timeless Vegas. Somehow in the few years since my last visit it's gotten a little dowdy. Someone opted to change the color scheme to brown. Why? Brown carpets. Brown walls. It just doesn't look as fresh and upscale as it used to. This translated to my room as well which wasn't brown but it wasn't fresh or luxe either. I stayed in one of the newer towers (15 years old?) which was recently ""remodeled."" It's in the Laurel Collection... I have no idea what that means. The decor (furniture and art) was surprisingly cheap looking but the room was nicely sized with huge windows and a large 2 sink bathroom with giant tub (jacuzzi which I would never use in Vegas... as what happens in Vegas jacuzzi tubs stays in Vegas jacuzzi jets) and marble shower with separate toilet room.  Everything looked better until closer inspection. The bed was genuinely awful (hard as rock) the pillows were uncomfortable and the towels were rough not plush. Like Motel 6 quality. Didn't have room service that evening but the people next door did... and the room service table with half-eaten food sat there all night... from the time I checked in to the time I left. Did no one from the hotel notice? A sign of a poorly run establishment.  Check-in was a little slow but my clerk was an efficient friendly guy from SF (Max)... they did keep the line moving and gave you a bottle of water when you got to the desk which is a nice touch. Self-parking was $18 in a garage about a mile away from the registration desk. Parking should be free or discounted for guests (it is at the Wynn)... but you pay the same amount as a non-guest. They also add a $45 resort fee which is standard these days in Vegas but of course remains a rip-off.  I did like the fact there was a Starbucks on the ground floor just next to the elevators. Otherwise you'd have to schlep to the food court (where I had a mediocre sandwich for dinner at Earl of Sandwich... best to avoid that place and the falafel joint) across the casino.  All in all a much lesser experience than previous visits which was sad. I wish they would change the colors back and get decent mattresses pillows sheets and towels. This place is the sole original classic Vegas hotel still standing (now 54 years old!) and hopefully management gets back to treating it with the respect it deserves."
50,All services were good the casino was a little warm and machines not real good. Didn  t win much but everything else was great. The food was expensive if you didn't have comps. Food good rooms good and service was good the people were nice very nice.
50,Sorry this review is so late but here it goes. RAY-V.I.P. really helped me out when i was there so hope you get the Kudos you deserve. This place just continue to amaze me clean friendly people somewhat overly priced but I guess it's Vegas right? I love it I love every second that I'm there and I can't wait to go back again in March not staying at Caesars but not the point Thank you Rich thank you very much God bless and hope everyone has a great day!!!
50,The hotel rooms and amenities are always fantastic. We were in the Palace tower. It was quite the rooms were spacious two toilets with a shared shower soaking tub with marble highlights in the bathroom with rain head shower stall. Everything you require is there. Great place to enjoy you Vegas Getaway
50,We visit Vegas almost every year. We have stayed a different places but always come back to Caesars Palace. The rooms are very large and comfortable. We have always had great service and the restaurants are fabulous. The location is great and easy access to everything.
50,So much walking in Vegas. Having a personal concierge I could text any question that came to mind was awesome! Saved me so much time and allowed me to plan my visit with efficiency. Also the people in Vegas are SO friendly! It was a pleasant unexpected thing that impacted my Vegas experience.
50,Caesar's as usual was beautiful. A great room in the Octavian tower for our 4 night stay. We had a slight electrical issue but it was handled promptly and efficiently. The technician knocked on our door within 10 minutes of our call. Kudos to the Housekeeping staff. Absolutely NO complaints -- hope to stay there again on our next visit. Enjoyed our time in the casino the cocktail waitstaff were friendly and prompt. Just a quick walk across the pedestrian bridgesand you can access the Monorail which allows you to visit other casinos/restaurants you may wish to visit. We each bought a one day pass ($13) and saw a lot that day.
50,We arrived and checked in and were told that our room didn't have much of a view so would we like to be upgraded for free to a disabled access room with a better view (we didn't as we are not disabled and thought it a but odd that we were trying to be given that room) we asked about any upgrades that we could pay for but were told that there were none at all available so went to our allocated room only to discover that it was directly above the live music venue in the casino! We went back to reception and saw someone different (SHELLY) assisted by her colleague Craig. They sorted everything out and found us a new room (which we paid for we weren't looking for a free upgrade although they did comp the first night which was so lovely). So we ended up in an amazing room and I really don't know why the first man we saw didn't find us the upgrade! THANK YOU SHELLY ON RECEPTION.    Hotel is very good lots of restaurants bars great casino an the Forum shops are really really good. Hotel room could probably be a bit cleaner as there was a lot of dust on the top of the headboard on the skirting boards etc but I would still say that the room was clean. I did use the housekeeping service to text to ask for the bed linen to be changed but it didn't work very well if I am honest - they turned up immediately when I had asked for the next day and when I queried it they just sent back an automated message about what I was doing that evening.    Parking is expensive at $20 a day considering you are a hotel guest.    Overall I would stay here again but with so many other hotels to try I would probably go to another one first.
50,Spent a night here during my stay in Vegas. I found the hotel very nice and clean although the room was a bit small. The deco of the hotel is stunning and has indoor fountains. The casino is clean and they offer lots of drinks
30,I think the property is beautiful and the room we had was gorgeous in the Julius Tower. Location is perfect but you‚Äôll still need a car to get to Red Rock Canyon or a cab to a show at another hotel. Cabs are everywhere. Give them some support. UBER has taken away their business.    Go se Michael Jackson 1 its awesome!    The reason I gave less than 5 stars was over some simple things that you get at other hotels that you pay for here. Parking fees and room amenities are a couple of things.    $20 a day to park and you are lucky they are not charging for towels soap and shampoo. They charge for everything else. I bring my own shampoo but what gets me is the room amenities they offer at high prices.    They give you a Keurig but charge $14 for 4 K cups and condiments. Forget about water just get it at CVS. I less you like overpriced FIJI water. Or snacks for that matter.    I understand this is a luxury hotel but the more expensive the hotel the less you get complementary and the more you are expected to pay for at inflated prices. I‚Äôve attached the room snack and bar list.    A $50 lamp chop at Bobby Flays restaurant may interest those with money to throw away but not me. It was so crowded on Sat night they were taking bar seats only.    It‚Äôs all very elegant and if you hit it big gambling then go for it!    The buffet was really good. Go during the week for lower price.    Another thing: the lobby smells like cigarette smoke and that bothered me. Go during the week because winter weekends are packed!    I was in Vegas 7 years ago but never stayed here. Figured we‚Äôd give it a try. I would recommend it just have some money to go around!!    Break the bank!
50,Easy check in and check out. Friendly staff throughout the entire property. Room clean and well appointed. Plenty of room to spread out and relax. Quiet and restful sleep with beautiful bed linens and pillows. Room Service menu has no prices this was my one and only pet peeve.
50,This hotel is great for a fun family vacation. There is something to do for everyone. If you want to have fun in the casion there is good vibe with the dealers. If you want to relax by the pool and sip on a Cuba Libre you can do that too.
30,The room was very nice and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay that is until we got the bill at checkout. First the amount charged for the room itself was about $100 more than I remembered booking it for online then there was the $50 resort fee. The total ended up being $504 with all the taxes and fees. This was midweek in February. Outrageous!
20,Poor customer service. Won‚Äôt go back here again. Rooms old front counter and VIP counter staff not helpful. Even had a big suite still bad service. Go to a cheaper hotel next time. Better service elsewhere.
50,Caesar‚Äôs never disappoints. So much to do and service is great! Restaurants bars and shows all good. Room was clean and comfortable. And won a little at the slots! Could use a good breakfast place but room service was top notch.
50,It was a fun time and great birthday experience staff was attentive and table dealer where real nice they didn't make your loss feel horrible I would definitely recommend ceasers palace for a birthday or weekend get away
50,Great on the strip location. Room was comfortable clean and large. Many. many restaurant choices.Super shopping. Entertainment choices. Overall a luxurious option for a LAS Vegas visit. Be prepared to pay for parking.
50,Excellent rooms and restaurants. Excellent service a lot of table games to choose from and slot machines. Clean and safe environment. Table dealers are really friendly and helpful. Excellent rewards program
50,If you have a chance DO stay at Caesar Palace.  This place is just beautiful.  The staffroomsfood the gaming area is just great .  The only down fall is the pay outs are not good at all.  The place is so kept up and very clean you'll never see dirt or a mess anywhere.
30,Beautiful hotel but they nickel & dime you to death which cheapens the quality of stay! Example ordered room service and was told meal will be delivered in 45 mins but I can pay $25 to expedite my orderüòí Another example I made reservations for the spa. However 4 hours before my scheduled appointment I was stuck in traffic on the freeway & knew I would not arrive on time so I called Quo Spa. I asked if I could move the appointment by 1 hour. I told them my freeway situation. I was told I would have to pay $35 to change time for a $400 serviceüòí & the person was rude & unprofessional. If I cancelled I had to pay 50% of service. Needless to say I paid the $35. Spa esthetician & masseuse were wonderful. Room was beautiful. Love the decor. Attendants registration & housekeeping staff were wonderful. However I will not stay at Caesar‚Äôs. Not worth it!
30,Huge place. Took Neva few days to figure out the layout but the casino floor is nice. Great food all over the hotel. Prices at the store for snacks are ridiculously high. But my biggest issue is the furniture in my room the desk and drawer combo looks beat up like it has never been replaced since opening. Didn't even have a handle on the door to open the refrigerator.
50,love this place people restaurants and table game dealers  rooms are good size  lot af food choices and lot of shopping  well lighted enough tables to cover all players  crap deales are the best and make good betting suggestions
50,I alwats loved Caesars Palace - and everytime I get a chance it has always been my first choice. Large Clean Variety in Slots Machine and Entertaining gaming table. Restaurants marvelous esp Mesa Grill
40,Enjoyed the casino and restaurants. The service throughout the casino was excellent! The meals were awesome and the service was outstanding! Will return soon and enjoy more that Caesars Palace has to offer.
50,IMO Caesars Palace is the largest resort in Vegas. Through the years they have really built it up almost to the point of being too big. We stayed in the Octavius tower during our stay. Room was very nice had a great view of the pool and seemed to be newly renovated. The pool is the best thing about Caesars as one could argue it is the premier pool area in Vegas. Endless pools lots of places to sit and even swim up blackjack and bar. Like Ive said the hotel itself is massive so lots of places to eat and the casino is never ending. Nice location on the strip as well.
30,Upgraded to bellagio fountain view. All upgrades were well overpriced compared to what was offered at time of booking. The views were nice and the room was fine. I guess take any upgrade offer at time of booking.
40,My husband and I Just returned from a 3 night stay at Caesars Las Vegas for an early birthday trip. Maybe we just expected too much much but it just didn‚Äôt measure up. We booked a king room in the Augustus tower in a strip view room. We arrived at the hotel around 12:30pm after picking up our rental car at the airport. We decided to check at the front desk even though we knew check o. Time wasn‚Äôt until 4 just in case their was a chance we might get in early and at least to put in our request for he highest floor possible. The first problem was finding the correct parking lot. The place is so huge and the traffic is so terrible that it took awhile and a few wrong turns to finally get to the correct spot. Not to mention they have at least 4 valet locations (Forum Shops VIP front of casino and regular valet). The regular valet is where we finally parked and I must say they were nice and quick. But the trek from there to the front desk was far...all through the whole casino. Anyway when checking in we were offered to check in right away for $50 extra. No thanks we were willing to wait. We did confirm that the room we had paid for did have a view of the Bellagio Fountains. We also asked for a high floor. He front desk agent said he already had that notes from my reservation but would add another note and that we would get a text when our room was ready. And that when we picked up our kwys to mention that request again. This text came right about 4pm. We went back to pick up our keys and were given room 2778. I asked which floor the rooms started at in that tower and was told floor 20. I also asked if we could get anything higher. She said no that was the only room available. And that it had a perfect view. Well it was good but you had to stand up at the window to see the fountains and one each side of the window there was a column which made the room feel set back and dark. The picture I posted was holding the camera right up to the window. We called and asked if there was any way we could get a higher room or one farther down the hall towards the strip. The front desk person helping my husband on the phone was very condescending. She said you were given that room for a reason. It‚Äôs the only one we have left. Even after explaining we had waited over 4 hours for it. She acted like we showed up at the last minute expecting to get a great room. We accepted the fact they didn‚Äôt wish to try and help us out so we decided to make the best of it. There were other little things that just didn‚Äôt seem up to par with what we expected. The heater didn‚Äôt get very warm. It wasn‚Äôt that cold outside but the room was chilly and we had to keep the thermostat set to 80 just to keep it comfortable. Normally that would be way to hot for us. And the bathroom sinks did not drain properly. The water stood in one of them every time we used it. The room was clean but there was only one bar of soap when we checked in and no shower gel. The lighting in the bathroom was not bright which made it hard when putting on makeup. There was a lighted makeup mirror but it barely out out any light. We have stayed at the Pallazo a couple of times and I would say it is much nicer than CP although I do like the area arming CP better. Much more ro walk to and see. I will stay again in the future to see if maybe his was just a fluke. I can‚Äôt help but feel that maybe they just cater to the high rollers and do t really care about us regular visitors.
50,What happens in Vegas stays... you just gotta experience it for yourselves.. just don‚Äôt order room service and be prepared to do a lot of Ub√©r-in and definitely check out planet 13!! Amazin amazing amazing
50,Awesome experience very clean room lots of space for the cost many entartainment options amazing location. Recommend to everyone who want to stay in Vegas and enjoy an amazing hotel experience. Totally worth it.
50,Love the restaurants//location and shows....We were invited to the True Food Kitchen VIP event and the food and atmosphere were awesome! I just wish the video poker machines were are inviting as the food and drink! LOL
50,The room was very nice. I especially liked the bathroom with a separate tub. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The only negative thing about our stay was the room service was exceptionally slow. 45 minutes - 1 hours for a pot of coffee...
50,Caesars Palace is an excellence place to enjoy shopping foods and gambling. I especially like the buffet is always good with many different choices. For a quick bite food court is always a place...I suggest to get a Caesars Reward member card with many benefits.
50,Great room great service and always a good time. I would always recommend Caesars stay for family and friends if they wanna great customer service and a wonderful time. The hotel staff is always on their toes always helping out and making sure you stay is the best it can be.
50,We stopped by the casino after walking around the shops. It was busy and we only spent half hour there. Won some money and left. Because it was so busy we had to ask 3 times for water and drinks. The service staff appeared overworked and tourists can be annoying. We‚Äôre like zoo animals on vacation.
50,Room was spacious employees were courteous . We did not have an assigned slot host however we met with guest services and were provided the information requested. Checkout was easy and painless with friendly helpful staff.
50,My husband and I visited Caesar‚Äôs this month for a quick weekend trip. We had a great time! The property is beautiful. There are so many good restaurants to try and some great shopping! We will definitely be going back!
40,Stayed here for 4 nights in Feb 2020. The OT tower was great. It is far from the lobby but is well worth it. Rooms are huge and very clean. No smell of smoke at all. The casino itself is very smokey. That is my only complaint of the whole place.
50,Caesars is always a fun place to go great shows  top entertainment  great shopping...and they also support our troops through donating shows to VetTix.... I live local so i have not stayed at their Hotel myself  but friends and family love the place.
10,my wife and I were insulted and we disrespected and did not a good experience when we check in at the VIP room by the man call Ray and after waisting two hours our hour time instead of celebrating my wife birthday
50,I have gone to Caesars Palace on several occasions to play eat shop or just to enjoy the atmosphere. I have had a beautiful experience each time. From the employees going that extra mile for me to winning at the casino. Caesars is a class act that provides A1 entertainment.
50,It's just a nice facility and I'll always come back. Not all Caesar's properties are equal due to location food options staff room cleanliness etc. The pool area is great in the summer and it feels like a resort.
50,The rooms are clean with plenty of room. The bathroom are spacious and have an upscale feel to them! The craps table here is one of my favorites along with the staff. They are very friendly and funny and will keep you entertained.
50,What an amazing performance. Truly inspiring to see her perform some old songs and some new ones. Her talent of sending truly beautiful songs to √† sometimes difficult world was still front and center. Thank you.
50,Room was very clean. Luxurious stay all the way around. Would recommend the buffet at Caesars. Best I've had in Vegas.  Stay was in the center of the strip so it's very easy to access many other casinos.
50,Great location on the strip. Staff wad extremely nice and helped with everything. It was a great trip and would recomend this place to anyone. I will return to this property in the near future because it's the best place to stay
50,My friend and I checked into Caesars and experienced the best customer service by Leallysa. We had a situation where each of us was in rooms in separate towers and where hoping to be closer to each other. She went beyond the call of duty by escalating the matter to her manager in order to get approval to switch us into the same tower. You can tell she really cares about people enjoying their stay and helped us with a huge smile on her face during the entire time. She communicated frequently what was happening as she worked through the process and even let us know a lot of hotel activities taking place. I highly recommend Leallysa and staying at Caesars.
50,Caesars Palace is the absolute best hotel in the country to visit for any occasion. The best vacation or meeting site in the USA. Super people from the front desk to the casino. Everything anyone could possibly ask for is here and pithing walking distance.
50,From the minute we walked in the door we fell in love with Caesars.  Everything there is majestic and the variety of food and entertainment they offer is superior quality.  I would highly recommend staying and playing at this property!
20,"I attended a meeting at the hotel. Since it was convenient I stayed there. After all they quoted me a price of $69 per night. Once you add the ""Resort fee"" and the tax it was more like $130 per night. That is without counting the parking which is only ""valet"" parking and takes for ever to get your car.  The room was nothing special. It smelled like cigarette smoke and there is no free water to drink.  My alternative would have been a Holiday Inn Express or a Fairfield Inn both decent with breakfast included no parking fees and no resort fees. Anyways I will know better for next time."
40,Been coming here for years club card is dated 1990. You knew you would pay a little more for the level of experience here but lately the dramatic increase for valet parking and resort fees have diminished the experience. $51 for resort fees when the pool is closed for winter??? $30 a day for valet parking!!!  That's $81 before you pay for your room. why don't they just charge more for for the rooms and not have these hidden costs. Just seems like a ripoff.
40,This has to be one of the biggest resorts on the strip... it‚Äôs huge!!!! The decor is amazing and the shopping mall is decorated the same. We walked through to just see the amazing statues and scenery- would recommend!
50,We truly enjoyed our stay at Caesar's Palace. Our room was awesome and had a spectacular view of the pool area. Some of the staff were not always as friendly and the restaurants are pretty pricey but overall we enjoyed our stay.
50,Nice room and great location to see many activities in Las Vegas strip.  Easy to check in using Kios system and check out on line.  Generous offer with free room gift card and resort credit to spend during our stay.
50,It seemed that every time I asked staff and employees for assistance they were very friendly and accommodating. The rooms that staff recommended were very nice and clean every day. I would highly recommend Ceasars and would return back as I traditionally do every year.
50,The best part of staying at Caesars is the casino host and the people working there. The rooms are OK but showing a little wear. Overall Caesars is iconic and classy. Always a fun and romantic time for my wife and I.
30,"My wife and I booked the ""Hangover Suite"" at Caesars Palace and invited our family (our three sons and their wives and seven grandkids) to join us for a celebration.  The suite was large but it is in need of an upgrade. While it is perfect for a bachelor party or guys weekend it is not the luxury that we expected. We had problems with the TV and the clumsy remote the curtains did not operate as they should there was a rip in the carpeting etc.  The room is amazing and it could be so much better with some new touches. The suite was clean and comfortable and it was enjoyed by all."
40,Service is always great and hotel is well taken care of. Lots of restaurant choices and entertainment. Wayne Newton in Cleopatra‚Äôs Barge was a unique experience. The theater is also a great venue not too large. Palace rooms have really nice bathrooms but it‚Äôs a bit of a walk from casino to elevators. Augustus tower is way more convenient. Pool was closed this time but such a beautiful spot.
50,We had the Best time of our lives during these 2 Special Occasions with our Get-Away. Sister and her husband have been married for 29 years and Celebrate their marriage each year in Vegas. I surprised my husband with a Fabulous Birthday gift of a All Paid 5 Star Trip of a Lifetime. My husband has promised to visit Vegas once a Year. Aah-mazing.
40,The hotel is gorgeous. The people working there are awesome! From the front desk housekeeping the casino always had a smile. We stayed in the Augustuv Tower the view amazing the room is beautiful. The only thing is when you pay the resort fee which is 53.00 a day you would expect to have coffee in your room without paying extra and the use of the fridge or opening the fridge longer than 15 seconds. They say they could get you another fridge for the room but we were told it would be $50.00. I think all hotels charge the resort fee but the fridge and the coffee should be included in the fee. Just saying.
50,The rooms are specious. The bath room is very large and bright with ample amenities. One of the most important qualities is the quietness. No matter which room we have been given the views are tremendous. We always are impressed with the pleasantness of the staff and their attention to detail. The limo service is always on time have refreshments and very courteous. They treat us like kingsand queens.
50,I have been visiting Vegas for a few decades. Every time I visit I go to Caesar's - I have never actually stayed here but I have spent many hours here.    It is iconic - it represents the best of Old Vegas yet is a good as anything else in today's Vegas.    I strongly recommend a visit to appreciate all this Vegas legend has to offer.    Go Enjoy!!
20,"My husband & I planned a get-away that fell on Super Bowl weekend. We made reservations over 6 weeks prior to that time and booked a suite. We've been loyal to Caesars for over 10 years earning diamond status in the rewards program spending a lot of money on rooms concerts & restaurants. Less than 48 hours prior to the trip we got a call from a casino host telling us that we're going to be moved to either Bally's or Harrah's our ""choice"" since they were overbooked by 600 reservations & we were on the list to be moved.  I was told if we showed up that Friday we'd be taken to one of the other hotels. When asked how we ended up on this ""list"" he said it was because we didn't spend enough time gambling there. It didn't matter that we spent thousands on shows or rooms or food we didn't sit at a table or machine long enough for them to honor our reservation. So we stayed at Harrah's but walked to Caesars for our dining reservations & the concert we paid for months before.  No need to be loyal to Caesars or any Caesars property again. I'll cancel my Caesars Visa & spend time elsewhere.  Be warned that no one is special at Caesars unless you are serious spend hours a day at it gambler. I get it it's a town built on gambling but it also spends a lot of money promoting food & entertainment and that's our priority. If you plan your trip on a busy weekend- Super Bowl or other keep an eye on your reservation at Caesars & listen for that last minute phone call."
50,Great experience and visit. The property is always clean and well appointed. The staff is always helpful and very friendly. I would recommend everyone to experience a stay at Caesars at least once when visiting Las Vegas.
50,It's hard to describe how cool this place is. It's all the little details that make up casinos. And this place has those from the statues ceilings at work. Restaurants and bars. You just need to come here and walk around and take it all in.
40,This was my first trip to Las Vegas so I had to stay at this legendary hotel. Wow! Caesar's has everything you need and the place is massive! This suite was the largest I've ever stayed in while traveling.However wifi was TERRIBLE and the solution was inconvenient: I was told by the front desk that I had to go to my room and call the IT department (from my room only) who then told me to go down to the front desk and show them my ID. What?? Clearly I checked in so they knew who I was! And not to mention the walk to the front desk from the room was a 15-minute walk!
30,I've stayed at Ceasars many times before. In the past it's always been wonderful. On his trip I was a little let down. The first Black Jack dealer that I encountered was rude and insulting. It's important to say that I actually came out ahead with this dealer but he was beyond rude. My wife was shocked that I stayed as long as I did (I was winning). Then the bed was so soft that my wife and I both woke up with sore backs. We had paid for another night but left a day early because of the overly soft and ultimately painful beds. Caesars has amazing history the rooms were very nice the restaurants were excellent but none of this makes rude employees or physical pain ok. It's back to the Mirage for me.
50,Had so much fun at caesars. Can‚Äôt wait to go back. Spacious casino and not overcrowded. Rooms are very clean and updated. Staff is very friendly.  Family friendly with a lot of things to do. Pools are great!
50,I have been to Las Vegas many times and have stayed at many different places. Caesars Palace is one of the best. Nice staff and clean rooms. It is very close to many hot spots  Food is delicious. Good shows too.
50,Excellent stay large room with beautiful decor. excellent and attentive service! played high limit baccarat for the first time and enjoyed the dealers and atmosphere. very good restaurants and close to the forum shops.
50,Wonderful mixture of Gaming Food and Rooms. Something for everybody. Valet BellmanCheck-in till Check-out Great experience. Inexpensive quality eating at food court or Many Top Shelf quality Restaurants on Premise. Michelle A. at VIP check- in is ALWAYS very Helpful Personable and Professional.
50,I have been going to Vegas for over 10 years and Caesars offers a range of shopping restaurants and great room options. My favourite is the BlackJack in the pool in the summer. I always try and stay at Caesars because of this. We also enjoy Nobu Carmines and the Forum shops.
40,If your looking to have some fun but to wild Caesar's Palace is a great choice. The crowd is a lil mellower but the service is outstanding. Looking forward to when the pools are opened back up in the summertime...
50,Usual pleasant Consistency - great restaurants bars gaming food court and updates!  Loved the Forum Tower's proximity to everything we wanted to do. Hallway carpets needed replacing - but rooms were updated and comfortable!
50,Add a very nice weekend at Caesars Palace. Very enjoyable with the Employees and the venue. Everyone was very helpful and went out of their way to make it feel like you were an important part of the experience
50,Great casino Had a wonderful time. Enjoyed watching the Super Bowl at the party we attended. We go every year at that time of year. Looking forward to attending the party again next year and having other friends join in on the fun.
50,Ceasers palace is and always will be the best of Vegas from entertainment to gambling to relaxing by the pool to eating amazing foods I would recommend it to everybody that wants to go to las Vegas simply the best
50,I love my location and room . It‚Äôs very convenient for me to walk back and forth to the room and downstairs for restaurants. My favorite was the pool view and clean room at octavious . I would love to stay at cearsar again in the near future!
50,I was having a very bad morning as my flight out of McCarran was extremely delayed and I could not get home to the Bay Area as scheduled. I ended up having to stay an extra night in Vegas which ordinarily would be fun but I had missed some important business meetings and was not in a great mood. On impulse I Ubered to Caesars Palace to see if they could help me with getting a room and was welcomed very warmly by Gigi in Diamond Registation. She was able to set me up almost immediately in an Augustus Tower room which is my preference and was even able to get me early check in. Thanks Caesars and especially to Gigi for making my extra stay more comfortable.
40,We booked a Palace suite several months in advance & its a great room! Plenty of well-decorated space for 2 adults. The bathroom was amazing! The shower & tub were the best part plus you get the extra half bath. Maid service was good. I even left a cash tip daily & it wasn't taken 1 day. I told a supervisor on the floor & he informed me they can only take tips when they are in the provided envelope. I liked that idea & my housekeeper was an honest person. The hotel is huge & getting around can be confusing. Our biggest complaint is that if they are going to have a smoking atmosphere they need a better air ventilation system...and they should be able to afford it with all the up-charges you get hit with. I got sick with an allergic reaction to the smoke on our second day (I'm still recovering). We were in the Bellagio & Rio for shows. Neither had the massive clouds of smoke Caesars had. I wonder how many poor non-smoker dealers have passed of second hand smoke after working there for years?! Food there is quite expensive but if you get out to other strip restaurants you'll spend a little less (especially at breakfast).  *take your own keurig pods theirs are 4 for 12.00  *check your final bill carefully! Both our rooms had mini bar charges for something we didn't use. We got them easily taken off with 1 call before check out. 32.00 condom set? I don't think so üòÇ  **Stop gambling when you're ahead of the house  ***And a big thanks to Macy for a flawless shout out to Michigan check in!
10,Very disappointed with my stay and at this point Caesars has lost a customer as I do not plan on returning.    It seemed as if I was getting constantly nickel-and-dimed throughout my stay. From the first impression at check-in where I required to pay $50 ($75 if I used the app) or wait until 4:00 or 5:00 pm before I could get my room. Then I was told that I would be charged $39 for the 30 minute workout. And then when I inquired if I could stay in the room an extra hour for an important business call I would be charged $30.    The above are just three examples of what felt like Caesar constantly reaching into my pocket. In each case the Caesar staff was very unconcerned about my situation and cared more about obtaining the extra charge.    I was part of a large conference where I heard numerous others with similar complaints and reports of diminished customer service.    Too bad staying at Caesars previously was an amazing experience. Now it is simply an expensive disappointment.
50,Stayed at CP for 4 nights. Enjoyed the hotel lots to explore shops shows restaurants and casual dining options. Hotel room spacious and comfortable. The fridge in the room is loaded with drinks if you remove a drink from the fridge to have a closer look at it and do not return it within 15-20 seconds you will be charged for it.  If you ask reception they will bring a second fridge to your room which you can stock yourself.
40,Good place. Clean. Nice decor. Helpful staff. Great restaurant & buffets. Nice & funny table dealer employees. Good food. Close to forum shops. Good lighting. Good machines. Nice design and architecture
40,Caesars casino has a lot of slots. I wish they have a non smoking area to play slots. A lot of players on my favorite machine i have to wait.The servers are very nice and attentive. My friends had so much fun as well.
50,What a great trip! From checking out Lisa Vanderpump's glamorous cocktail lounge to gambling at the tables - we had a wonderful trip! We will certainly return again and hope that we receive even more great offers from Caesars Rewards! Thank you.
30,After my regular hotel closed after 25 years and 1500+ nights of being in residence it was time to find a new LV home for my business travel. Caesars Palace was my first choice to check out and I was sorely disappointed in my experience. My room in the Augustus Tower was spacious well appointed and clean with a great view of the Strip. Trouble started on my 2nd night after a long day of work. I entered my room to a strong chemical odor. Checking out the bathroom I found that the shower fixture was torn apart and in middle of an apparent repair. I notified the front desk and was told the shower was damaged while the room was being serviced. I was told that I had been reassigned to another room pack up and visit the front desk to pick up the key. Exactly what I wanted to do after a long day of work. At the front desk I was offered no apology or compensation for my troubles and was reassigned to the same type room on a lower floor. Bummer!    Reviewing my folio upon check out I noticed a $50 charge from the spa. When inquiring about it I was told ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the fee for using the fitness center‚Äù which I did use twice. I was also questioned why I was not charged a Resort Fee for my stay! (I‚Äôm Caesar‚Äôs Diamond!) The charge didn‚Äôt bother me it was more the fact I was not notified by the spa staff of the charge when I checked in to use the fitness center and my ID was not checked to run a room charge. Bummer!    I was hoping to find my Las Vegas business home away from home at CP because the room and facilities were very nice. The staff just really turned me off with the lack of empathy and professionalism I‚Äôm accustomed to.
50,Caesars is my favorite casino on the Strip -- offering exceptional facilities and customer service; with conscientious friendly and attentive staff. We visit often -- and will certainly be returning soon !
50,Caesers always on point. Went to see Van Morrison at the Colosseum and everything was first class as always. Casino is great and the wait staff is timely. Will return every time I'm in Vegas. Literally never had a problem.
40,The sports bar is massive nice and quiet. There are only the machines at the bar that aren‚Äôt really loud. It‚Äôs a nice get away from the really noisy rat race. Bartenders were friendly enough. My only complaint would be that it is hard to find a machine to sit at lots of people taking up seats that aren‚Äôt playing.
40,the room was great the hotel overall was clean and a great enviroment. the check in can improve but is probably normal for las vegas. We had a great trip here and i would recommend friends to come and stay here.
30,Paid for an upgraded room and what did I get? Clogged sinks In every bathroom. Thanks! *this coming from a diamond member and not someone who bought a room at a discounted rate off of a random website...
50,The food was great especially the buffet and steakhouse. The gaming area was huge and the action was fast. Room was also very nice. The two days we stayed there just flew by. Would highly suggest to try the buffet and the steakhouse one of the best ribeyes I‚Äôve ever eaten. The slots have something for everyone from a penny up to twenty five dollars. Gambled for many hours and only lost a couple of hundred dollars so I considered myself a winner.
40,Booked in Augustus Tower very nice. Neat and tidy with clean air smell. Amenities were excellent maids and staff were very positive and friendly.  I would highly recommend Augustus Tower for upcoming planned trips for our family.
50,Had some noise on the last night from 12-3am; otherwise great stay clean and large room friendly staff easy check in process gym very large facility prepare to walk alot! Many food choices to chose from
40,Check in took forever and check out was confusing. Luckily I found a casino host that figured things out and checked me out as I caught my flight. The drink service is slow on the casino floor and the dealers didn't seem interested in being there.
40,This hotel is always a must to visit. The buffet at caesars is ridiculously top shelf. The sports book has all types of sports and the staff are very helpful if your not familiar with a small wager bet.
50,This hotel is very nice the rooms are spacious and casino is huge so many slot machines and tables you‚Äôll never get bored. A lot of shops and restaurants that won‚Äôt disappoint. I would definitely recommend this hotel to stay at!!!!
40,Enjoyable casino with lots of action. TV moniters well placed for viewing all around. Good selection of food available in the food court.  Only negative is long walk from self parking to check-in and with all the customers drink service was slow.
50,The room was so nice. The location is fantastic right in the middle of the strip. We loved all the food there. The casino smelled like cigarettes but as whole was awesome. We definitely will be back!!
50,I always asked for high floors and strip View and were always granted. Parking was not a problem. If I ran out of cash I could withdraw with check. The offers are a wide variety of choices and are all fun.
40,Visited Vegas so we stayed in Caesar Palace lovely hotel didn‚Äôt enjoy the long queue. We got charged $40 for early checking even though the room was ready you have to pay to use any facilities thought it‚Äôs meant to be for guest long time if you need any help from  The phone. Love the surroundings didn‚Äôt like the service
50,My husband and I decided to do an early valentines in Las Vegas before all the hustle and bustle. Upon arrival we were very well taken care of at the front desk and had a great experience with all of the staff. We enjoyed lovely meals gambling and shopping all within the vicinity of our hotel. We absolutely love Caesars Palace and cannot wait until the next time!
40,This was my first time here and it is big. Bad thing there was only one map at the front door that I could findbut really should hand out pocket map at ck.in.Food was good room was great. But cannot even use refrigerator in room without being charged. And also could not make coffee in room without being charged. That is ridiculous that they even charge for coffee.
50,I had an excellent time during Super Bowl weekend with my buddies. Plenty of laughs and great moments from this trip. Caesars Palace was the perfect place to watch the Super Bowl at.....their party was outstanding!
50,The rewards you get are great. We received tickets to the super bowl party. The food and drinks were provided and very tasty. This was our first super bowl party there and it was so much fun. Not only that but the Kansas City Chiefs finally won a super bowl for me to see.
10,Dirty Bathroom  Incompetent Staff  Broken Safe  Plugged Toilet  This is not a 4.5 star hotel. It simply provides the service of a motel. I have never felt so stressed and frustrated on a vacation. Bad Ser
50,I stayed at Caesars last weekend and stayed in a suite. The staff was great the room was clean and i felt at home. Mesa grill by Bobby Flay is a must when your looking for lunch or dinner the food and service is the best i have had at the hotel.
30,Resort fee on top of high rates.extra charge to get in room early even though avail@ble.  Nice rooms and friendly dealers. High high prices for food and drink. If you are not a gambler the strip very crowded . Of course good shows but better to stay in more civilized environment.
10,12 of us booked at Caesar's for my birthday celebration and to see Van Morrison. The concert was amazing....the hotel not so much. Before we arrived two couples in our group got calls from Caesar's advising them that the hotel was overbooked and they may be moved to another hotel. They were offered comp weekends but told the caller 'absolutely not. We are with a bunch of friends for a celebration.' One was called back a second time and told that despite saying no they may be moved anyway. I called Caesar's to no avail. Was told that my reservation was guaranteed as I booked with a 3rd party. There was no guarantee for the rest of my friends who booked directly with Caesar's. So we arrived not knowing what would happen. As we checked in we were offered early access to our rooms at varying prices....$50 $75 & $100. It seemed like the staff just made up rates as they went along. One couple was forced to stay at Harrah's despite vehement protests against being moved. Being comped a room in a cheaper hotel does not make up for the inconvenience of not staying with friends. All complaints and comments were met with the same cookie cutter company line response by staff. Not impressed.
50,We stayed in the August tower on the 23 rd floor with a view of the Bellagio towers. I got a two queen bed room The room was very clean and very big enough for my two daughters granddaughter and myself. The concierge made sure to send me enough towels and necessities for four. The view was awesome the room was very clean and spacious. I would recommend Caesars palace to all my friends and family. My granddaughter was really impressed!
50,Caesars Palace is huge and very nice. Our room has an awesome view of the pool. The bathrooms are huge. Big shout out and thank you to Maria S for helping us check in and helping to make our 16 anniversary super special!
30,i have a dust mite allergy and this room was very dusty. in my opinion the dust build-up showing on my finger was 1-2 months worth of dust. the beverage service was slow on the casino floor (~1 hour).
40,Hotel is so large you can get lost a bit. The rooms are nice size and comfortable but not overly fancy or new. The check in and check out was fairly quick. The staff is friendly. Price was fair since we were there for a conference. We would stay here again.
40,Enjoyed our stay at Cesar's. We were in the Forum Tower. Rooms aren't ultra-new but not worn out either. Staff was friendly/helpful. Check in and check out were fairly simple. I would stay here again.
40,Quick and friendly customer service. However stupid requirement to supply 200 character minimum for this feedback session. Yaddi yaddi yaddi yaddi yaddi yaddi yaddi. Yaddi yaddi yaddi yaddi. Yaddi yaddi yaddi Too stupid and self serving
50,We enjoyed our time in the shop‚Äôs and looking at the design of the hotel. Very unique and on a grand scale. Lots of places to sit and rest and great restaurant to visit also. We will most definitely be back.
40,Stayed at Caesar‚Äôs Palace for the first time in Las Vegas in August 2019. Great location on center of strip. Gave a $40 tip to very friendly check-in clerk and asked about any available upgrades. Received an upgrade to a nice 700 sq foot suite overlooking the pool. Room was very nice and spacious. Restaurants were a bit pricey but very tasty. Casino staff was friendly. The only real downside to the property is it‚Äôs size. Due to it being so enormous it seems like it is a long walk to get from place to place on the property and would be the one thing that might prevent me from staying in the future however I‚Äôm glad I gave it a try.
50,Visited in February during the cold season. Had dinner at one of our favorite restaurants in Caesars The Old Homestead Steakhouse where the food and service is awesome. Also like their 24 hour cafe The Americana. Belong to their rewards card and well worth it.
40,We were with my husband's company which paid for the room so I can't comment as to the price of that. The room was really nice and clean. Beds were comfortable. The restaurants and stores wanted top dollar for everything. Pancake breakfast at the 24 hour place was $24. I had a $26 turkey sandwich. Gone are the cheap places to eat.
20,They Owen harrahs they need to make sure there people give people a clean room other then that it was nice place food was ok Vegas is not all its cracked up to be pool closed to early hope the can make the rooms cleaner
50,We traveled for a last minute girls trips. Hotel was clean and staff was excellent. Loved the casino and the convenience of having a mall inside of our location was even better. Even though we walked to Miracle Mile Mall. We will be back to stay at Caesars. Love our stay!
50,Caesar's is certainly not brand new. However it is a great spot and has been carefully updated as seemingly necessary. We were there during an unusually cold and windy spell so walking around Vegas was not something we wanted to do. The great thing about Caesar's is that everything you want/need is right there. The mall is wonderful even if just for walking.    All of the staff that we interacted with were warm and helpful. I loved their automated check in and check out service. It was quick and painless!!!!    One thing I must comment on is that security was randomly present at the elevators. When they were there we had to show our room keys as ID that we had reason to be in the area and getting on the elevators. I thought that was great.
10,This property charges a $51/day resort fee. There is no resort. The pool is closed. This insultingly includes local telephone calls and WiFi. Someone should do a class-action lawsuit already against these fake resort fees which only hurt the consumer. I am extremely disappointed. This is just another way to hide fees and misrepresent costs. Scam.
40,Huge hotel with a nice concert venue. A little worn out but the service was excellent. Many dining options from high  end spots to Starbucks. The room was large and quiet. Nevada was colder than Boston when we were there.
10,When we arrived the person in the lobby did not even say hello and She was rude the rooms were noisy If you self Park the lobby is far far away from the lobby in the room you have a coffe machine but dont think is free like any other hotel They charge 15 dlls a day for a coffee and it does not say anywhere in the room it does no appear in the mini bar list so you think is free they also charge 50 dlls resort fee ( so you think coffee is included but no!) The person in the lobby whose name is Delano he Was very rude he said: of course coffee is not free and when I told him that this was my last time staying at Caesars palace he said: we do not care!
40,We met some friends to wander and gamble down the strip. Stopped at the Lobby Bar just off the table games at Caesars Palace. Very comfortable relaxing romantic. Michelle C was our server. Pleasant. Kind. Courteous. We ordered three different Martini's and one White Russian. Sat. Talked. Drank. Didn't push us out. Place was packed. I would have to say that Caesars is the smokiest casino of all of them. Needs an upgrade in there vetilation. Very nice time.
30,Firstly I have arrive to las Vegas first place I've stayed was Ceasar Palace nothing's like my 3 night stay where I was treated good on getting all booked in with no problems. Secondly gambling over at the tables where I was all of a sudden security comes by me and pulls me to the side and asked me to leave the table if I was done.
30,Clip joint always more fees resort early check in no coffee. Extreme waits to check in. Did not text us when room ready until about 18 hours after we got key. Concert venue was jammed up so bad we missed 3 songs of concert as we waited in line
50,Room was amazing and the choice of food and shopping leaves you with no reason to leave the resort. Plenty of gambling options in the huge Casino and Sports Book. The service was second to none would highly recomend
50,. We enjoy over 20 years in Caesar Palace Las Vegas  The service is outstanding The food is Excellent . Room is clean & comfortable . We will go back again & again . I highly recommended the best choice Hotel to stay .
50,We always try to stay at Caesar's Palace. The property is kept extremely clean the staff is courteous and helpful the restaurants are aplenty and the property is located centrally to all that we enjoy doing.
30,No complain on room quality even though I was provided a very end room. I requested a single bed room that was not provided. Not sure the benefit of diamond club status. Amenities are good. The only problem I encountered was that the bath tub was not draining. It was cleared by the room service personnel
50,Family weekend getaway to celebrate my mom‚Äôs 75th birthday. I know she looks a lot younger ü§£We had a wonderful time at Caesars; Great and kind Staff since check in great service great facilities great location very convenient. First time at Caesar‚Äôs it will definitely not be the last. Bye for now Vegas.
40,We booked this trip because of the Van Morrison concert.  We were on the NW end of the Palace Tower on the 23rd floor. The room was spacious and the bathrooms were very modern. Unfortunately the linens were very low quality including towels sheets and toilet paper. Even though our view was of the outdoor pool area below the room also picked up all of the noise from the freeway.  Like other Vegas resorts you are charged a daily resort fee ($44.00) which did NOT include the use of the in-room Kuerig ($14.00) or refrigerator ($70.00).  Caesars palace is very convenient and has a lot of gambling options and restaurants available. The Cigar Bar on the casino floor is top notch.
50,We stayed last week at Caesars. From start to finish a great experience. Very clean property. Everyone was nice and professional. Had a good time playing tables and slots. Room was great. We will be back soon!
50,This was our annual trip to Vegas for the Super Bowl. Always make sure to go to Caesars. Great food great entertainment good place to gamble. We like a lot of action and Caesars seems to always have that.
40,This is a great hotel especially in the summer because of their pools. During special events like the Superbowl they do raise table minimums up a lot but you can always go to other properties for cheaper tables. Walking around can also be confusing note there are several casinos areas so go exploring.
50,Room was comfortable hotel staff courteous food service 24 hrs a day. Pleasant environment AC worked well shower and TV amenities top notch. Concert venue has wonderful acoustics and beautiful seating!
40,Room was excellent  everything was clean . We really enjoyed our show absinthe. I would recommend that show to everyone it a must see. We were laughing the whole way through. Also valet is always welcoming
10,When we initially booked a suite at Caesars we informed the desk that we would be three guys and would need a roll away. No problem. The first night in the room we requested a roll away and were informed that it would violate fire code. No problem. I asked them if I could rent another room. We were not trying to be frugal or work the system. The room was $149 plus a $50 resort fee plus a processing fee. I explained that we were only getting another room because we had been misinformed when we made out initial reservation. They said they would waive the resort fee and the processing fee. We lost $6000 in their casino in 48 hours so this was still a good deal for them. Today at work my receipt shows the $50 resort fee. I called to protest. 10 minutes on the phone them 20 minutes on hold waiting for a manager. They said they had not made notes and therefore did not believe me. We were great guests to have and were open to a new room and having a fun and expensive weekend.
50,Palace tower 646 we enjoyed ourselves The room and staff were great. We had to pay extra to check in at 10 am which was not communicated on your website when we booked. Other than that we had a great time.
50,We went to a concert and it was great weer had great seats to begin with then they relocated us and we had even better seats. My only complaint is it cost $43.00 for a 16 oz beer and a Vodka Tonic. I bet fainted. Nice place and a definite stop if you are in Las Vegas.
50,Smooth and quick check-in beautiful room great in-room amenities and wide variety of playing options all made my visit pleasant. Dining options were nearly endless! The Super Bowl viewing party was just perfect--lots of people working the tables in the viewing room all the food one could eat great desserts and drinks of all kinds. I'm already planning on returning in April!
40,Room was nice as always. Employees were very courteous and helpful through out the trip. Casino was clean and fun as always with numerous different games and slots. Room service employees really took pride in their work.
50,room was well kept. property was great plenty of things to do. food was excellent. gambling wasn't too bad. we come during super bowl weekend and two to three times a year other than that. we will be back.
40,Clean room friendly service and great location on the strip. From the taxi stand to check in I had a great experience. The buffet was one of the best I have ever had with a ton of variety of different foods.
50,Great Hotel in a central Las Vegas Strip location. Beautiful rooms and lots to do with the Forum Shops attached. Many restaurants and food choices to experience. My favorite place to stay in Las Vegas!
30,no big complaints nothing expectional about this location friendly staff.  food was ok . valet pricey. door man quick and friendly . 45$ resort fee off the top. may or not not visit again nothing drawing us back will probably check out another hotel around in the future for a different perspective
50,Trip was Absolutely amazing can‚Äôt wait to go back how was upgraded to a room with Fountainview just like I hoped to get in the front office was attentive and helpful the property was clean beautiful looking forward to get back to it
30,Caesars has always been excellent and this is our go to property......However we feel with the upcoming sale to Eldorado they are letting things slide cutting back on imenities etc....What was once was an elite property in Vegas is slowly falling behind. I hope they fix it.
50,I love visiting Caesars. it has the best location in Vegas to get to other casinos but more than anything it has the best and friendliest tables and fun machines. from the old to the most updated. i wouldnt say anywhere else.
40,Overall experience is OK. The room situation was not good. 1 bed for two male adults .  Other than that everything else is good. Lots of amenities for all guests including wonderful restaurants clubs shopping etc.... Decoration is very nice with lots of Lunar New Year theme. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Need at lease one or two bottle of water in each room. This is a five star resort/casino everything thing gets charged including water bottles.
10,"Really horrible experience at Caesers Palace. The room was in horrible condition (see pictures attached). Upon visiting the help desk and asking for the room to be changed we were told that this is the room we booked so nothing could be done. Also they understood the rooms were ""dated"" but unfortunately nothing could be done. They were extremely unhelpful and had a bad attitude. The only thing that was good was the location but that is literally it!"
30,We stayed in an Augustus Tower strip view room. The only really good thing was the view. We got a good view facing south which allowed a good view from Bally's to the Eiffel Tower the Fountains of Bellagio and the mountains. It would have even been better if the windows were washed!  As for the room it is not what we expected especially after staying at one of the other Italian themed resorts across the Las Vegas Boulevard. The furniture is dated and the scratched the carpet is so worn out on the common travel paths you can't make out the pattern. It has a desk but no outlets that you can use to plug in your laptop. The single one available that we had by the desk had to be use to plug in a small fridge to keep my wife's medication. BTW it was complementary because it was for a  medical reason; otherwise it's $20.00 / day! When we arrived 2 of the pillows were matted down there was hair and stains on the bed It appeared that someone had been sitting on the bed with their shoes on. I called the front desk at about 4:30 PM and it was 7:30 PM before the bedspread and sheets were replaced. The sheets were extremely rough. Later we found a crusty stain on the sectional sofa.  Also when you enter the Casino the first thing that hits you is the heavy tobacco smoke. If you look up at the low ceilings you can see the tobacco smoke stains.It is also not a wheelchair friendly casino. Several times we had to find an alternate route because we came upon steps and no rampnor elevator nearby.  On the positive side the staff is very friendly but it won't be enough for us to stay there again.
50,We enjoyed our stay at the Palace. The upgrade to a suite was a nice touch. Our room was large and comfortable. The hot tub as a nice touch. The only down side is you had to pay for coffee in your room. With the cost of everything at the hotel one would think that the hotel could provide a cup of coffee in the room.
10,Empty pockets...and I am not referring to gambling which I did very little of so lost $20...I am referring to the non stop gouging. I ordered a cup ONE cup of hot tea and it was $5. I paid $300 for a Van Morrison ticket not an after market ticket either and ordered a plastic glass of wine to enjoy while watching the show. Yes it was a 9oz pour it was also $25.  I spoke with the housekeeper saying I think they overlooked restocking the coffee and tea. She surely thought I was an idiot. She kindly told me we no longer provide those items but you‚Äôre welcome to purchase here by the minibar. Right that was $15.  I arrived early for check in I was offered early check in for $85. I said fine. I was then told room was not ready (I had requested a room with a non connecting door) and they‚Äôd notify me. I waited 5 hours which put me to legit check in time but was still charged early check in. To be fair I have attempted three calls and was unable to reach accounting but did finally receive a message with a phone number to booking. I called. They were closed. They‚Äôre open Mon-Fri until 6pm Pacific. I‚Äôll try then as no one else was able to correct this oversight.  In short this is crazy ridiculous gouging...and you notice I didn‚Äôt even take on the ‚Äúresort‚Äù fee or dining. Take loads of money because you‚Äôll need every bit of it.  It‚Äôs a given that I will never stay on the strip again. The more tourist who opt out the quicker a change will come about! Good luck folks!
50,Michelle A is a delight! She's checked me into this hotel on multiple occasions and she always goes above and beyond to try and accommodate my needs as a guest. Despite sometimes having limited room availability she manages to finagle a room for me! Even when I asked a simple question for some information she wasn't able to procure an answer right away but she went the extra mile so that the next time we saw each other she was able to provide me with more than adequate details and multiple options regarding my request. And our conversations are always personable. Incredible service! She's great.
50,I always enjoy staying at Ceasar's. They have the best all around collection of casino games sportsbook restaurants and bars not to mention the amazing buffet. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay with something for everyone!
20,"So I landed in Las Vegas and received an email to check in early! Very excited. I went through all the hoops and tried to add to my apple wallet! BONGGGG! Wrong answer! It wouldn't let me! So I completed the form online and it said to go to the kiosk. I went and went over the same procedure but this time had to add my license. It said that I would receive an email when the room was ready. WRONG ANSWER! Not email. So I went to the line where you are supposed to pick up your magical keys and had to wait for 30 minutes. Every time the clerk tried to help a guest she ran into the back room and must have gone take a nap. I did notice that there were at least 9 other clerks waiting on the line I should have been in. They were moving very fast and did none of the pre check like I did. When she finally returned with a manager the line had doubled. ONE person for 25 guests waiting for their magical key. IT DOESN""T WORK!!!!!! Skip the email skip the kiosk go directly to the line to check in and you can get in early! Their technology department should be fired. Someone sold them a bill of goods on how effective this could be. What a waste! TV in the room doesn't work. Waiting for the magical electrician to show up. Been one hour. 78 degrees in the room with trash still in the waste can. Someone had Starbucks. Stay somewhere else! It's not worth the $$. Go across the street and only come here to visit."
40,Caesars very nice but way too BIG  Got understandably more and more crowded leading up to the weekend  Next time we will stay across the street at Paris    The buffet was awesome  Next time start in back or just go for dessert 1st    The desserts were amazing !!!
50,I love Caesar Palace. With all my frequent trip to Vegas it is always hands down my go to place to stay. They have everything from comfortable room regardless which one you book to eateries to entertainment. Of couse casino area for late night and early morning play. Make sure you sign up for their rewards program its one of the best. And finally concierge Ivy is the best. She always avalaible 24/7 and readily avalaible to answer any queation even at 2 am in the morning!
20,Felt like a victim of price gouging after being charged $50/day for WiFi gym & local calls I never even used. They also charge you for coffee in your room ($15) and there‚Äôs a fee of $75 if you use the mini fridge for personal useüò≥  They also charge you for late check-out. Food & drinks were very pricey and the casino stunk like cigarette smoke‚òπÔ∏è  On the upside Van Morrison put on a great show!
50,I had an amazing experience at your number one property in my book. The restaurants were great and the service provided by your employees was above my expectations. I travel to many of the Harrah's properties throughout the year and this one by far is my favorite. I will be returning next month enjoy some much need rest and relaxation and this time I am bringing twelve guests with me. Bellagio comps me rooms as well but to date I have never stayed with them as the service and quality of my stay is much better at Caesars. Keep up the great work.
30,Horrible service from staff . Misinformation given and not followed through on! Given the fun around when asking for medical care after taking a horrible fall. Manager offered nothing and was unwilling to assist us!
50,My wife and I went to Las Vegas for the Van Morrison concert at Caesars. Our room in the Palace Tower was exceptional Generous in size with all the expected amenities. Two bathrooms separated by a huge shower!  Food was exceptional. We ate at several of their restaurants and were not disappointed. Two of our favorite's were Pronto's daily buffet and Rao's. Jimmy was our waiter there. He is very knowledgeable about their menu and very attentive. We had exceptional service provided by Latoya at the box office.
20,Boy where do I begin? I am a Diamond Club member so I was promised several perks as a means to lure me to their hotel. Our stay at Caesars started out great. Jay at the check-in desk was amazing friendly courteous and professional. I enjoyed the added extras (water coffee etc.) in the Diamond check-in area and thought that was a nice touch. The room was okay. There were large stains in the stone in the hall of the room (Octavius tower) and in the bathroom. It did not look like stains that would be easy to remove but they were there nonetheless. The rooms lamps were not operating correctly but they did not bother me much. But for several hundred dollars per night this is something that should be addressed. Also $13 for a mini bottle of San Pellegrino water? $7 for a mini bottle of Fiji water? It's a complete rip-off and goes to show you what the management thinks of their customers. I completely understand an up-charge for convenience but this is a joke.    My problems were many with the Total Rewards Program. The fiscal year apparently ended and restarted (at midnight on Feb 1st) during my stay and my Diamond status was unavailable for half of my stay (Jan 27-Feb 3) due to a technical glitch. The whole purpose of booking my trip was to take advantage of the Diamond status and there were serious glitches that prevented me from enjoying the perks of Diamond status for the last 3 days of my stay and I was inaccurately stripped of my $100 dining credit during my stay. Of course as soon as I returned home my Diamond status was back to good standing per my account. Too little too late. I spoke with 8-9 people at Caesars including the Diamond Club receptionists as well as several people the Total Rewards desk about this issue and no one seemed to be able to figure out how to remedy this situation. It was a headache and not something I wanted to spend 4 hours on while on my vacation not to mention - the inability to use my Diamond perks during my trip.    Lastly the check out process was a nightmare. When I arrived to the check out desk I noticed that the pricing on each night was significantly higher than I was quoted when booking the room (a total of over $200). The gentleman taking care of the check out (Cameron) was very nice but he did not understand how to fix the problem and gave me misinformation several times (he indicated that the base room charge was inclusive of taxes but it was not). I had to stand by while he called corporate who listened to the entirety of my initial phone call recording where I was quoted the room rates. It turns out that I was grossly overcharged for the rooms as per the initial phone call recording and I was made to wait while Cameron entered each night's room charge manually. I was at the check out desk for 75+ minutes. We ended up missing our lunch appointment and had to head directly to the airport. At no point did anyone offer an apology. I had to fight and argue with Caesars to get what I was rightfully quoted. It was aggravating so much that I will not be maintaining my Diamond status with Caesars nor any of the Caesars properties and will allow my status and business with Caesars to expire. There are countless other properties for me to visit instead.    I awarded 2 out of 5 stars; one for being a pretty nice hotel and having a decently sized room and another star for the Bacchanal Buffet which was excellent.
10,They furinish the rooms with a Keurig coffee machine however don't provide even ONE free one. You HAVE to purchase it from mini-bar.. We stayed there 3 days and our dirty throw-away cups were never replaced since we didn't buy THEIR coffee.. Also when this was brought up to the DIAMOND check-in manager nothing was done about it.. She said we could have called housekeeping for more cups. REALLY !!!!! Won't stay THERE again
50,The Hotel was perfect. Food and entertainment awesome. The feel from the casino was exciting and happening. The cigar bar is truly one of a kind.  We ate at Ye Old Steak House and we were treated like Kings the food and service was 5 star.
10,Waited in line for 30 minutes then told about a $75 early check in fee. Said ok to come back later but would have to wait in line again. Asked Fabian for a manager & he brought over Martha Martinez. She was incredibly rude so I asked for her manager & she said that I would never be able to speak to them. Fabian just stood behind her laughing.  Worst experience do not stay here.
40,Gaming is great and the room was ok except for the bathroom shower and sink the employees were great and restaurant were all good and housekeeping were prompt to response and despite the small setback we are highly recommending ceasars to friends and relatives
50,This was my first time staying at Cesears Palace while in Vegas. The entire trip was wonderful. I have no complaints. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to all my friends and family looking for the best place to stay.
50,Fantastic Hotel and Casino. Highly recommend staying here. Clean safe and fun. Great places to eat and play. Also great entertainment. Fun! Fun! Fun! One of the best Hotel and Casinos in Las Vegas. Very centrally located.
50,I absolutely love Caesars Palace there are so many unique things to see and do. The buffet is incredible so many options to try out. It's so beautiful during Chinese New Year they decorate so over the top.
50,the customer experience was excellent... From the time I checked i and the days of my stay were most memorable. House keeping was so on top of making sure the room was always clean and linens towels etc. were fresh.
50,We arrived very late in the evening and were greeted very warmly and professionally at check-in. She made sure our room was what we had requested. She was smiling and laughing with us while at the same time very efficient. Our room was clean and quiet. We loved the big walk-in shower in the bathroom as well as the toilet being private (with a door). The casino staff was efficient and helpful. The check-out process was a bit slower for us as they did not have the Platinum member area open but the process was friendly and efficient as well. We had left our bags with the Bell Hop and did not experience any problems retrieving our luggage.
50,Was just an awesome trip. Everything and everyone we ran into was great.Rooms were great food was awesome. The whole weekend was just a great time  would go again without question just loved it.  thanks Caesars Palace
50,Fun weekend winter trip. Love staying mid-strip with so many activities dining and gambling options. Never a dull moment at Caesars. Ramsay's pub is excellent - highly recommend. Renovated Julius tower won't disappoint.
50,Another epic Super Bowl weekend with the boys. Caesars never disappoints. Great location in the middle of the action and with employees who make a good time great and a great time legendary. We will be back!
20,beware of overcharges. $13.00 for in-room coffee is an example. Rooms ar Ok but nothing special. The Casino floor is hard to navigate. Employees give good service but management is only concerned with the dollars.
50,Hotel room was clean the location was perfect food choices are great and we have stayed there quite few times and never ever have had a bad experience. Also the hotel is connected to the mall which is great.
50,Octavian and Julius ballroom was great staff and management was very friendly and helpful! I would recommend Caesars Palace to many people because Caesars Palace is very upscale and classy. Friendly and fun environment
50,The room was elegantly decorated with a view of the Bellagio water fountain show. The Augustus tower was close to many parts of the property The VIP room was great as always. When you arrive ask for guidance from Caesar‚Äôs excellent staff. The main gambling floor gives you a sense of belonging. I found very helpful and friendly staff and friendly players from all over the world. Table games away from the main floor at times have lower minimum limits. They have a large selection of slot machines from standard to game type to choose from. I have eaten in many of the restaurants at the property and I can truly say that I have never been disappointed. Just the opposite I have experienced some of the best meals I can remember. I recommend Rao‚Äôs Mr. Chows Beijing Noodle etc etc etc. If you are in a hurry try the food court which is good and not expensive.
30,Great location. Love the set up of the hotel. A lot of choices of restaurants. Rooms are really nice. But the casino playing tables really bad condition very unclean needs some makeover. Great night life
50,Room cleanliness was exceptional. All services in the hotel area were very well delivered.  Everybody was available to offer help in making my stay comfortable.  Making dinner reservations was extremely easy to do. The restaurants affiliated with the Caesars Palace property were very good.
10,After making a reservation 10 weeks in advance I received a call the night before I was supposed to fly into town and was told Caesars Palace was overbooked and I had to stay at either Harahhs or Bally‚Äôs. If I wanted to stay somewhere else I would have made reservations accordingly. I can‚Äôt ever trust Caesars to keep my reservations again. This is unfortunate because I go to Vegas 3-4 times a year.
30,Didn‚Äôt get a good view in our room and everything is over priced. Overall it wasnt a bad stay but I feel like we could have gotten better service with food/drinks. I would still probably come back though
50,The stay started with a superb check-in experience. We were with friends and requested rooms near each other which isn‚Äôt always easy but more challenging on Super Bowl weekend. Mega and Leallysa in the Diamond Registration made it happen....very much appreciated thank you ladies! Our rooms in the Augustus tower were very comfortable and well appointed with a nice view of the Bellagio fountains. As usual our dinner at Old Homestead was superb!
40,The Planet Hollywood Super Bowl was terrible compared to last year and the previous years... the food options was terrible and the bar options were mediocre.  They use to have such an amazing set up and awesome buffet  Now it‚Äôs awful. I highly recommend making other plans for future events
50,We always choose Caesars everytime we go to Vegas because of the perfect location and friendly service. i love the fact that we don't have to go out of the resort when need to do some shopping or dining. Everything is in one roof. Lots of restaurant options. I love the Forum shops.
40,We had a very nice time at Caesars once again staying in the Augustus Tower. Staff is Extremely Friendly and Readily Available if you need Anything!    WE did receive an Upgrade (because we asked) and the price was reasonable and we were appreciative of the Front Desk Personnel.
50,We were there for Super Bowl weekend with friends and the staff could have been easily overwhelmed due to the large parties in the hotel but they were all professional polite and helpful. There are a lot of good places to eat and shop if you want!
50,The hotel is ery beautiful & the food was great The customer service was great. Overall good experience. Would highly reccomend watching the atlantis show with kids. Also had amazing customer service at Coach from the young lady working.
50,There‚Äôs so much to see & do even if you don‚Äôt gamble and they have lots of casino partners as well.  The variety of games is great and they do a good job of keeping up with the free drinks if your gambling. The rewards system is nice if you use your card. They will Comp you free rooms.
40,We only stopped by for a little bit on this trip but its always on our list of places to stop by when we're in Vegas. Ceasar definitely has alot to offer when it comes to slots restaurants and shopping.
50,Great room with 2 bathrooms is the best. Never ending options of things to do. So many awesome restaurants and bars. The Sports Book is a bit older but still plenty of seating and lots of open tellers.
50,BEAUTIFUL CLEAN - GREAT EXPERIENCE! GREAT LOCATION! IT's large so if you want an all-in experience it's at this casino. Even if you don't a taxi/uber is right there for you --- best location on the strip.
50,like the dealersthe total rewards peopleall the restaraunt staffand sports book people.I need to get an onsite host at caesarsas I love my host from the rio(bill cook)but would like to stay at caesars next time.LOveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee this place
50,Really appreciate the excellent accommodations great choice in gaming and competent friendly staff. We have consistently had great service and always enjoy our stay. The entertainment and choice of dining options are first class.
50,I have never been disappointed during the dozens of times that I have stayed at Caesars Palace and this time was no different. The staff anticipated my needs and desires even before I had time to think of them. Bravo!!
20,Love the shopping here. We have been to Vegas a million times and never stayed at Caesars. Our room online was $60 the resort fee and other fees brought our total to $150 the resort fee is RIDICULOUS. Our wifi didn‚Äôt work my husband needed to use it for business. The room is in desperate need of a makeover. We arrived a little early instead of letting us check in they made us pay an additional $75. So our room that was supposed to be $60 ended up being about $250. We won‚Äôt stay here again.
40,Amazing hotel and resort. World class restaurants fantastic decor friendly service this place has it all.    Our room was beautiful and elegant. Great shower and bath double sinks marble flooring. Very comfortable. And great beds and pillows!    Only negative for us as a family is that the registration desk is a seriously long way from the parking garage which means dragging all of your luggage through the smelly casino.    Aside from that loved our stay.
10,After driving 8 hours straight I was told at check in with no prior warning that I was downgraded hotels and no longer had a reservation there even though I‚Äôd made my reservation 3+ months in advance. That is TERRIBLE customer service and just bad business.    Although they tried to make up for it in comps the downgraded hotel room we were given at another property didn‚Äôt have the main amenities we‚Äôd booked our original room for. We also realized later that someone who handled our bags on the bell cart at Caesars from the trunk right back to the trunk dropped something that had car keys in it and they went missing for two days.    It was such a big disappointment and got so out of hand that it ended up ruining our whole trip. I will never stay at another Caesars property ever again.
50,I really enjoyed the tub and personal concierge text ability to request towels. Loved staying here and would come back again in a heartbeat! As well the staff all around the hotel were so helpful and prompt with responding to needs.
50,My husband and I took a four day couples' getaway at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas NV this January 2020. This was our first stay with Caesar's Palace. We were treated like visiting royalty by each and every employee at Caesar's. The room was elegantly decorated and so comfortable. I am a vegetarian and had no difficulty finding veggie friendly food at the restaurants and in the casual dining Forum at Caesar's Palace. I used the large well appointed fitness center daily. Each morning the fitness attendant personally greeted me offered me water and a towel. This was a getaway experience of the highest quality and surpassed our expectations. We plan to return soon.
50,Caesars is a beautiful hotel with everything you need and more. The employees and customer service was amazing. I would definitely go again. This place was so much fun. One thing for sure I would highly recommend this place to friends and family.
50,Caesars is the only place I stay because it is consistently the best place on the strip. Weather by myself or with a group Caesars is the only place for me. Make sure to sign up for the Caesars rewards app and get your points thats the key. I‚Äôm a diamond member and trust me the  amenities are well worth it.
50,We have a great time. We are well taken care of. Fatima Ehlers who is the Asian Marketing host arranged everything that we needed for the stay. She knows Our preference especially the room close to the elevator She‚Äôs a wonderful host. Well deserved recognition. I am well pleased with our stay.
50,The room was clean and good view and location. I wish i want go back next my birthday with my family again. I recommend my friends to come enjoy this hotel and facilities as great level. Also I'll tell my  co-workers and recommend Caesars Palace to come stay and enjoy it.
50,Once again Caesar‚Äôs exceeded all out expectations! Some of the best food in Vegas and I couldn‚Äôt imagine a better room. My wife said if she could of took the bed back to Kansas City she would have. We booked a Fan Cave at the Linq on Super Bowl Sunday (a Caesar‚Äôs property) and were glad we did. I might add that the gaming was great and our cocktail waitresses were on top of it.
50,Had a great stay will return soon. Joe‚Äôs Crab was as good as always. I wish they had more Pai gow and roulette tables open in the morning. But otherwise it was just fine. Also they kept running out of Casa amigos Tequila
50,I was in a rush during check in and was trying to get my room moved. Becky at the registration desk offered to help and quickly resolved my issue. I felt like I was given top tier level service which blew me away for my first stay at this casino.
40,So much to do at this property... and I am not a gambler. The rooms are very large clean and well decorated. The choices of restaurants are great. Food is very good... and the staff is excellent. As a frequent traveler I tend to forget that Caesars's provides a great experience. YES there are newer hotels in Vegas... but this place is very solid! The only complaint... room service is a bit crazy expensive
40,Nice room. Deluxe no frills room. Clean and comfortable. Heater wasn't working upon arrival but was repaired within an hour of discovery. Housekeeping was quick to respond on removing the down pillows that we were allergic to. I do wish they had not done away with Coke products at the resort though
40,Located in the heart of the Strip this is a great collection of different hotels and activities under the same big big roof. Great and speedy check in ample rooms quiet AC and heating system and many things to do. Definitely will return again as we have been there many times. Two points of notice: 1. last day my checkout was supposed to be at noon and it was moved to 11 am without a proper warning a no no. Noon time was respected but after a phone call. 2. The corridor between Augustus and Octavius Towers smells needs better filtering.
50,Friendly staff  nice and clean room. I will definitely recommend this hotel because it‚Äôs in the center of strip. That‚Äôs the only thing I have to say but this guys forcing me to write 200 minimum character so I have to add this.
40,The room and facilities were fine. We stayed 7 night and not once did someone check to see if things were going ok. We did our share of gambling and did not receive contact from a host. This is the first Caesar‚Äôs hotel that a host did not make contact with us
40,"Right off the bat ONE STAR is deducted because they have the audacity to charge $14 for coffee to put in the in-room coffee maker. This is after you're forced to pay a $50 ""resort fee.""    Just because you CAN get away with something like that doesn't mean you should.    The room was very nice clean etc. but that pettiness cheapens the experience and the Caesars Palace brand. It's a shame because it's such a storied and iconic property. Mini bar prices were ridiculous too. Is it starting to turn into Spirit Airlines? You betcha.    Oh and expect to walk MILES in the hotel. Literally. The place is huge. That's not a negative but just a warning."
50,Everyone was very hospitable the rooms are very beautiful clean it was easy to navigate at the hotel. The whole hotel restaurants were magnificent. My host was extremely helpful to me called make sure everything was going good asked if I needed anything.
40,Caesars has something for everyone you just cant go wrong when you visit! The shopping. Gaming food and shows all some under one roof. The energy you get when you are there is indescribable It is just a fun time.
50,Great place and shops. And table games. Stayed on the table for a few hours. Met new people and had fun. The forum shops are great too. Spent a week in Vegas and played here most of the time. My favorite casino.
50,Beautiful property friendly and helpful staff. Very comfortable room. many choices for any type of food craving! Everything you need on one property! Delicious food in every restaurant that we visited. Many shopping choices
50,Always a great time at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. The food is incredible and atmosphere is electric. I couldn't get tickets to a show because I waited until the last minute (my own fault) but no worries I'll be back in June. And when we come back I must check out a few shows.
50,I wish the CAESARS casino had not reduced the chances for players to win. The todays CAESARS Casino is no longer like the CAESARS Casino I knew before. The players have almost 0 chance to win. That has greatly reduced my interest in visiting the CAESARS Casino. I hope this complaint can be delivered to the leadership of the CAESARS Casino.
50,Check in line was short and lady at counter gave me an upgrade to Julious Tower which turned out to be nice. Almost as close as the Forum towers which is close to the sports book and everything else. The All American breakfast is very good but as everything else is high priced. Lobby bar is the best viewpoint to see what's going on.
50,The establishment is 5 Star My complaint is how I was mislead and bounced back and forth like I did not matter! Should not offer something you don't stand behind! The staff could have been more helpful!
40,Room was absolutely amazing! Love it Augustus tower with strip view was amazing! Just felt drinks while gambling were very hard to get and barley saw a drink lady! But it was a great trip the coffee shop was excellent too!
50,Another great stay. The Augustus tower rooms are really nice. Caesars never disappoints I recommend you give it a try. And when you are there make sure you give Nobu a try. I also tried Gordon Ramsay Hells Kitchen. The lobster risotto was amazing. Can't wait to get back.
50,"The room was excellent as always ! Our host Pauline meet us on arrival check in quick and smooth she took us to our room and made sure everything was perfect. We had a great dinner at the ""Bacchanal Buffet"" and headed out to see Aerosmith. We spent 4 days there and very day the service was great even being on Super Bowl weekend. I highly recommend eating at the Gordon Ramsey Pub & Grill we ate here twice be sure to ask for Sarah this lady is so special ! Check out was smooth and quick can't wait till next time."
40,Overall trip was amazing. Lots of gaming options food and shopping. Ceasars is an excellent place centrally located on the strip with nice clean rooms.only issue I saw or had was lots of smoke from smokers could have better ventilation such as Mandalay Bay or Aria. And in addition some of the dealers are disengaged dry and rude. Maybe been there too long and don‚Äôt appreciate their jobs due to tip sharing system. Either way they are the face of the company and should have better attitudes. Just felt disheartening. Most staff were amazing and super friendly. Probably just a couple bad apples.    Food and parking is great and plentiful. And gaming options are abundant.    Thank you
20,Having read a few reviews before I wrote this one I can only say that my experience of Caesars Palace was very disappointing compared to many other people. I can only identify with Jasmine1900's comprehensive review and reiterate everything she has said. Yes the rooms are large and comfortable but offering a coffee maker without any free coffee capsules in a 4 star hotel plus the sky high prices charged for the coffee and other in room drinks and snack on offer are not acceptable to me. If you go to the restaurants and eateries in Caesar's they also charge highly inflated prices too for very average food but that is par for the course in Vegas.  The worst thing for me was having to walk through the Casino to get in or out of the hotel because of the foul air which stinks of smoke because they allow gamblers to smoke inside. I did not gamble in there for that very reason. The whole ethos of Caesars Palace seems to be very money grabbing and to squeeze as much money out of its clients as possible. I would never stay there again.
20,We booked this 4-star hotel when we saw the price was much lower than the hotels that we usually stayed at in Vegas.    Caesars Palace charges a hefty resort fee ($44 before tax) which can make that seemingly ‚Äúgood‚Äù hotel deal you found online a little less appealing.    The high resort fee was particularly unpleasant as the pools were closed for winter. Additional fees occur for personal use of in-room refrigerator (hotel charges extra $75 for personal use and has weight sensors to determine your usage). Wi-Fi is included only for the first two devices. This included our two cell phones but adding Wi-Fi for our laptop would cost an additional $15 per day! The room had a Keurig machine but does not include any coffee (you can buy their packaged coffee for $15!).    There are drinks and snacks available for purchase (again with weight sensors to determine usage). Notably we arrived there was an empty pop can and empty spaces in the snack/drink display. In our adjoining room the fridge and snack trays were empty. We immediately alerted the customer service as we did not want to pay for someone else‚Äôs purchases.    After room cleaning housekeepers did not leave any cups for us to use.    The room itself was very nice large and comfortable. However we will never stay at Caesar‚Äôs Palace again. BUYER BEWARE!
40,The most amazing part of the Palace was the shops.  The magnificent sky effect in the shops the fountains the lobby the chandeliers left us jaw dropped.  It has shops restaurants and galleries.  A little too ostentatious and grand but certaily worth the trip.
50,The rooms are large and comfortable. The casino has a large variety of slots and gaming tables. The entire property is clean and well maintained. The staff is always friendly and helpful. The dealers are very helpful to new players.
30,First of all I booked this last February (yes 11 months early) to secure a great place to stay for New Year‚Äôs Eve. This is our 3rd trip to Vegas so we kind of know-or thought we did- to expect. Vegas itself it NOT the Vegas of even 10 years ago but I will stay on point with this hotels review. Check in seemed pretty easy although we never really got that ‚Äúwelcome to Caesars‚Äù feel. We were placed in Forum palace-YIKES! The mattress might as well been a deflated bounce house. The room was sort of clean but because it was so old and outdated looking it was certainly not appealing. We asked for and were given a different room. This is where 1 star comes from as it was New Year‚Äôs Eve and the clerk let us know they were hoping people wouldn‚Äôt show because they were 103% booked! Second room a little better-one floor up and across the hall from the first so the more of the same but at least the mattress was better. The sink leaked the showers water temp fluctuated and the toilet wouldn‚Äôt flush. One of the most troublesome points and the main reason you will never get our business again were the nasty woman you post at rewards service desk. I stood in a line and each time it was my turn one or the other women spit out ‚Äúseven stars diamond? I would reply no. They would abruptly look at other line next.... I waited 10 minutes basically because now I was alone in line and one finally and reluctantly had me up to desk. I needed a new card and she could not have be more rude. ‚ÄúNext time go to the machine right there as she pointed and get one yourself!‚Äù That was it the final straw for Caesars. Got the card to use the points! Ha! Gambled for 3 days and got $2.00. Finally the resort fee...you offered us absolutely NOTHING in terms of hospitality or anything out of the ordinary that should cost a dime more than the fee for room. I didn‚Äôt even get a complimentary cup of coffee paying a ridiculous $5. at your lobby restaurant. Even low budget hotels provide this basic service. Approximately 10 days later...here come the emails with offers. Perhaps you should offer something while one is actually there for this reason I won‚Äôt be signing up for any of your offers. It was a big big disappointment. FYI Caesars you are NOT the only game in town you want repeat customers..then earn them.
40,Caesars Palace was a perfect place to celebrate five 60th birthday amongst long time friends. Palace Studio rooms were ideal for the reunion and partying with two separate bathrooms and large couch area.
30,I found the check in process clunky. It took a while to get through the line to check in and at 4pm my room was still not available.  There is a lack of maps and it is difficult getting around finding specific locations.
50,"Great timewe do all our gambling at Caesars Windsor all year but come to las every Jan love walking the strip and going to showsWe""er both in our 70""S been coming here for 45 yrs and will keep on coming."
30,While the hotel it‚Äôs self was beautiful and over the top; there were things that I didn‚Äôt like at all. We stayed at the octavious tower and oh my goodness the walk to and from the lobby was just a little to far. I felt like I was being punished. The hotel is just too big For my taste. There was no personal touch and interaction with me as a customer. The waitress never came around to us to take our order for drinks. My family stayed at the Mirage and they got free $30 drinks per day and free parking without having to sign up for anything. I will not stay at Cesar Palace.
40,Stayed at Caesar‚Äôs to give us convenient access to a concert at the coliseum theater. The lobby and casino areas as you might expect in a place on this scale are frenetic noisy and reek of smoke. Check in was fast and easy with their auto check in terminals; this is the way to go!  Our room in the Octavian Tower was very nice. Very spacious well appointed comfy bed and quiet. Elevators were really fast a blessing in a huge place like this.  We are at Hell‚Äôs Kitchen (very noisy but great food and service and the lobby restaurant for breakfast. Self parking is easy and not too expensive $18/day) although a long walk (through the casino of course) to reception and then the rooms. Took about 13 minutes.
40,I had played in the casinos was a great experience very clean and very well laid out.  H  O had 3 bussiness lunches at gordon Ramsey's. Overall a good experience but serving staff needs to be more friendlier and aware of ther clients
40,The people make the difference. Caesars owned hotels have great people working for them. Super friendly and always helpful! An example was at check in. We had a request to place our rooms close together. This wasn't easy because of the bus holiday weekend. Instead of saying sorry we can't accomodate the request they worked through how to make that happen. The extra effort they made made a world of difference for our trip!
50,Very clean rooms service was good and food was excellent. Great crowd for nightlife and lots of properties to visit. nice vibe as not too pretentious but still classy and friendly crowd. Spago Gordon Ramsay burger was excellent.
50,Really a great hotel in evey way.. Only good things to say about it.. The only bad thing was I couldn't stay longer. The hotel room was top quality with a whirlpool tub in bathroom. Bed was comfortable with feater pillows and soft sheets. I had a very quiet room for Las Vegas and slept great.
10,We reserved a suite with one king bed. When we checked in via the self serve kiosk it showed a suite with one king bed. When we got to our room it was a regular room with two queen beds. When we questioned this we were first told we were mistaken and then they finally admitted they gave our room to someone else. We were then told they would move us the next day. The next day we were told that we would not be moving rooms nor would they be refunding our money. The staff was dishonest from the start never once telling us upon check-in that our room had been downgraded. No one ever apologized offered us a refund in the price difference in the room or did anything to try to make this right. On top of this the facilities just seemed in general run down. The carpet in our room was worn some of the light sockets didn't work and the shower light was burned out. We will go out of our way to avoid Cesars as well as any property managed by their parent company in the future.
50,Great visit. From the moment we arrived at the valet parking to the table games checking in the room and checking out employees were very helpful and customer service oriented. Not one issue with any of the employees. Rooms were extremely clean well up kept and front desk was very welcoming and helpful.
40,Ceaser's Palace in Los Vegas is a beautiful resort! I love to walk the concorses. The slots are plentiful the cocktail waitresses are tastefully attired and very hardworking friendly and prompt. There is so much to see lots of resturants venues to fit every taste every budget. The Total aRewards desk needs more customer service reps on duty the wait time to get a card was way too long!
30,Room was good food not so much. Very tight machines. Check in was good & room was ready within an hour after arrival. Food prices were way too high for the quality of food that was served. Not sure I would stay @ that property again.
50,I have stayed at Caesars Palace several times and it seems each time I stay is the best yet; but I know it has always been a very pleasent and error free trip. I always have at least a yearly trip which includes the limo food and room. Every service I received was outstanding. The Dealers hospitality service dinning areas sports booking etc were very very cordial and helpful....as always. You can travel throughout the entire property and find all kinds of stores and eating places. It is a large property.
50,Over all Excellence!!  First trip was little problem in the room(restroom door is not close)  So we asked to them that fix the door. But we changed mine because too late. After we came back to family trip againThey gave a good sevice.
50,I showed up and was treated excellent. My wife and I enjoyed everything about the casino and staff both were excellent. I‚Äôll definitely be back and will refer all of our friends to stay at Caesars. What an awesome experience
50,Great customer service room was awesome and we will always be loyal! I was not aware of the volume of travelers due to meetings. I thought the expense in comparing hotel to hotel has something to do with that. Hope to come back soon. Always fun
50,Palace Tower overlooking the pools is the best choice great Suite rooms. Dining choices are outstanding Casino is great and shops are second to none. We prefer Caesars as our top choice in Vegas. Great location on the strip everything you will want to see and do is very close.
50,My room was extremely beautiful and clean. Everything was conveniently close. The staff was very professional and kind.The food was delicious. The hotel is located in middle of strip and was easy to get to other places. (centrally located.) I actually won playing slots.
30,"Beautiful well maintained huge place. Walked for half a mile to get to our room in the Palace Tower. Our room turned out to be the most distant from the elevator as well. No complimentary coffee in the room. Essentially requires you to pay $14.50 for 4 K-cups from snack tray each morning. The place seems comfortable charging for virtually everything. Including charging $50 for ""early"" (1 hr.) Check-in. We won't be staying here again."
50,Ceasars is a grand and exciting cadino hotel with gorgeous room and awesome looking gaming tables and slots. Employees r nice and helpfull. Only the coctail waitress in the poker room are rude and the worst servers in all the casino poker rooms in las vegas.
20,As a seven star guest Ceasers should have shown a little more hospitality towards me while I stayed there. They were very unaccomdating unwilling to work with me and made me feel as if I never spent any money in their casino. I was extremely dissapointed in the stay there. The rooms were very outdated and need to be brought up to date as well.
20,I was so excited to experience my first visit to Vegas as a Diamond Players Card holder. I used two of the many comped hotel offers from Harrahs which includes $xxx in freeplay. When I went to the Rewards counter the employee said she didn‚Äôt see any freeplay and that I had to see the host to link my stay with my rewards (which I already did). My family and I use the app to navigate the hotel but it took us to the wrong location. Nevertheless we stumble upon the Host office. We waited to be acknowledged by an Asian gentleman slightly robust and in his 30‚Äôs behind the desk. I could tell he was busy so I quickly explained that I was a Diamond player and that I wanted to use my freeplay that my family and I were there for two days. Gave him my players card and had all my email and app offers ready to show him. He informs me that the offer was not valid at Caesar‚Äôs Palace and that i couldn‚Äôt use it at any other Harrahs unless he transferred my reservation. I should‚Äôve took him up on that. He also mentions that there are different levels of Diamond and made me feel that my status wasn‚Äôt worth his time. I wanted his help with a few other things but at that point my family and I just left.  Another issue was the reservation system. When I made my reservation on the phone the operator was unable to book my two nights consecutively though I have offers for three nights two nights and multiple one night stays. I went ahead and booked two single night reservations and made a note to talk to the hotel when I check in so that I wouldn‚Äôt have to check out and check back in. I had my husband call the lobby the night we arrived to make sure that they had joined the two reservations. They confirmed it was fine and we didn‚Äôt have to do anything else. My daughter had a cheer competition so we met the team to get ready and ran back to hotel to get the rest of her things we had maybe 30 mins to get in and out. Get all the way up to our room after a snafu with valet (don‚Äôt get me started) and Neither of our room keys work. Clocks ticking have to get her uniform now... so I called the operator from the house phone by the elevators and tell her we‚Äôre locked out. She says she‚Äôs going to send security up to help us. We wait 5 mins and decide we don‚Äôt have time to wait so I head down to the front desk and the ‚ÄúAmbassador‚Äù said there was a problem with the card on file. B.S. no way my husbands card has been declined. Turns out the reservations were not joined and they used the wrong card to charge second night. And now my husband has to leave our belongings with our child in the hallway come down to lobby to get new key cards. We are now late to the competition check in that 30 girls and their families and coaches paid to participate in. My husband makes it back to room with keys i shoved food down my kids throat got dressed and flew out the door. Went to valet in the front and requested car but in my error when we returned earlier I parked in the rear valet and they were unable to locate my car. With no time to explain to the car attendant that we‚Äôd figure it out later and need to catch a cab to the event. The attendant wasn‚Äôt listening and I literally had to snatch my valet ticket out of her hand because she wouldn‚Äôt return it to my husband. We jump in a cab and thankfully didn‚Äôt ruin the entire trip for the team.  In summary we felt there was no accountability for employees at Caesar‚Äôs Palace. The operator didn‚Äôt communicate with security (never showed). The online early check in system doesn‚Äôt communicate with the reservation system didn‚Äôt link the right credit card. The front desk doesn‚Äôt check reservations when you call them and the Host service is worthless to Diamond ‚Äúlower level‚Äù player. Bllllltttttt. I should‚Äôve stayed somewhere else. Very disappointed.  Oh and the room was standard the desk was pretty worn and the remote didn‚Äôt work in the bathroom. The automatic blinds were also broken. Bed were comfy. Pillows weren‚Äôt.
50,Chinese New Year. Kevin at the front desk with outstanding. Ivy who oversaw Guest Services exceptional. The service / professionalism with Kevin and Ivy was to just fantastic! Overall the entire staff was friendly and very accommodating!
50,Where to start the rooms are clean and big I normally have back pain after waking up and no back pain we had a excellent experience we will definitely be coming back soon. We loved java taxi waiting outside for us. Thank you.
50,Stayed for the IHBS and had a wonderful stay. It was an easy commute to the convention center. As far as dining The Old Homestead is amazing. Also Hell‚Äôs Kitchen is a wonderful experience if you can get a reservation.
50,Love walking through Cesar's palace and seeing fountains painted ceilings and overall atmosphere. Employees were helpful like total rewards features and benefits. Breakfast buffet was great. Lots of variety
50,I try to stay at Caesar's whenever I go to Las Vegas. I was there for a convention and got stranded when my flight was cancelled. My VIP Host got my room re-booked for an extra day within minutes. All the staff is extremely friendly and helpful and the remodeled rooms in the Palace Tower were gorgeous!. Food is exceptional although it has become very pricey.
40,Room was nice. Could use a deep clean. Fun area to gamble. Make sure to check out freemont street. It was like stepping back in time. I also would check out a show or two while you're in town. The food can be pricey
30,This was my 4th time staying at this hotel. Overall satisfactory visit and satisfied with the accommodations.  Two important watch-outs:  1) the coffee in the room is NOT free as it is in most top hotels I have stayed at (Fairmont Ritz W etc.) Not a big deal but pretty annoying.  2) MOST IMPORTANT: If you pick up any of the items and look at them for more than 5-8 seconds YES...5-8 seconds you will automatically be charged!!! the signage is on the minibar door which can only be seen if you actually open the cabinet that it is in.    I discovered this on my second day of my stay and called the front desk with my concern. That's when they explained the 8 second rule. The movement is tracked electronically and it showed that was being charged for a coffee kit (which i did use) beef jerky pringles an intimacy kit (LOL) and water. They sent someone up to confirm that the coffee was the only i used and they cleared the other items from my bill.    I'm sure this is similar to other hotels/resorts on the strip but the front desk does not disclose this upon check in...something that they should do.    So....buyer beware. if you touch it you bought it!
50,The room was amazing had an amazing view of Las Vegas the Casino was great had a whole much amount of fun and I will be coming back for another visit some time soon this is the best place I do recommend this place to all my friends
50,So far my experience staying in Caesars palace has been amazing and this is because of one person. Ms Tangela at the front desk provided SUPERB customer service and genuinely cared about our concerns. Ms. Tangela is the reason I will be coming back to Caesars. She has made our vacation hassle free and memorable. The best experience of my life!
50,Caesars is the only casino who seems to care about gamblers like myself. I have talked with other casinos and no matter what I tell or ask them they do not seem interested in my coming to their casinos.
50,Great overall experience from staff to dining. Staff was excellent as well as all our dining experiences. Will be back in March to stay at a Caesars resort. Bring a few more first time couples with us on the next trip.
10,"We received a comped stay at this hotel. It was our first visit. I checked in at their mobile kiosk trying to avoid the long check-in line. No one greeted us during this time. Upon arriving in our room in the Forum Tower I commented out loud-""This must be where they stick the ""Comped"" guests. While the space was large it had a view to a cement wall--so no view at all. The couch was sunken in completely looking like the room had seen some parties in its time. The furniture was scratched and looked very worn. Don't touch the water or fridge those would cost extra by the way. Upon checking out to review our bill I saw upgrade charges. I called and visited the front desk to dispute the charges. However they said I accepted a room upgrade upon checking in. I would never have upgraded the room and certainly DID NOT find this room an upgrade since it was a room that looked into a brick wall. Shocker--that is a suite! The front desk person was not kind and said I accepted the charge and did not notify them that I was in the wrong room. I said wow I never thought I was in the wrong room because the room in my opinion was crappy. I asked to speak with the supervisor. She came back and said they would not do anything. I asked again to speak with the manager. Someone did eventually come out and explained the same thing to me. I said I though the kiosk should then have multiple layer to accept a room upgrade. She said well you should have come down and told us when you realized you were in the wrong room. I said I almost called to tell you I thought the room sucked but was willing to accept it because it was a comp. She eventually took off two nights resort fee charges (whatever the heck those are) but I paid for an upgraded crappy suite. Overall I will admit a mistake was made apparently by me trying to check myself in with no assistance. However I found the staff completely rude and pompous. They never said we are sorry or anything--just placed 100% blame on me. I will NEVER in a million years stay there again-comped or not suite or not. Thanks for reading. If this makes one person chose to stay at a different property then I will feel better. I hope you have luck in Vegas or at least not get screwed by your hotel. Avoid the self-check kiosk! Know what you are getting!"
10,I don‚Äôt usually write reviews but here I just want to take time and do it. I‚Äôm an experienced traveller and have been all around the world usually staying in 4 and 5 stars hotels so I can say I have some experience to compare.    1 ‚Äì check in ‚Äì took us 45 min and people at the counter didn‚Äôt even try to be nice only tried to sell us upgrades like robots  2 ‚Äì the room is fine but no luxury feeling not even ‚Äúmaster light‚Äù button switch so you have to go around the room to turn off all the lights one by one. The sink in the toilet was always clogged good that they have 2 of them...  3 ‚Äì cleaning in the room is also not great ‚Äì I left in the morning and came back by 3pm it was still undone then the cleaning ladies tried to do it fast leaving many things out for example wine glasses stayed dirty didn‚Äôt leave any paper cups etc  4 ‚Äì they charge 75 dollars for using the refrigerator. Taking in consideration they don‚Äôt have options with breakfast included you would want to have at least yogurt in your fridge but be ready to pay 75 dollars for that. Never seen anything like that anywhere in the world  5 ‚Äì they have coffee machine but no coffee capsules you have to pay 15 dollars for that. Never seen anything like that anywhere in the world  6 ‚Äì I asked cutleries to my room 2 forks 2 spoons and 2 knives I was told I was gonna be charged extra for that. Then I asked just for 1 of each and they brought it for free... is there a rule how many forks you can ask for free?  7 ‚Äì Wifi is only free for 2 devices. Any additional device is 15 dollars    I am still in the hotel for 2 more days and wonder what else I will have to add to this
20,Room in the Palace Tower was nice. Coffee maker in room but in order to use you had to pay for the coffee for a ridiculous price! in fact you have to PAY $$$ for everything at this hotel. The resort fees include wifi!! Really! Paying for WIFI as a hotel guest! Check in kiosks didn't work..and the in-room check out failed as well! Can't get away from the smell of smoke throughout the casino and hotel rooms. Glass of wine in one of the casino lounges...$21! Value for what you get -- complete disconnect! Money would be better spent elsewhere!
50,Great clean Hotel with friendly customer service from bell service check-in personnel and room service people. Great restaurants from lower to mid range to very high end. Great gambling and 2 cigar lounges. I'm Happy happy..
10,We booked a room back in October for a weekend at end of January with friends. Caesars ‚Äúcasino supervisor‚Äù called me 24 hours before check in and told us that Caesar‚Äôs was overbooked and offered to move us to Bally‚Äôs Flamingo or Linq ‚Äî all lesser properties in my opinion and all of which are rated lower on TripAdvisor.    Caesars has held my deposit since October for this room and yet chose to give away my room.    I cancelled and moved across the street to a better hotel. I will avoid Caesars properties in the future.
20,Caesars is attempting to take people out of the vacation experience. Automated check in that doesn‚Äôt work. Room service orders placed online. No people available anywhere. A bad precedent being set by a former leader in vegas
10,The room was so small it would have literally fit inside the closet of one of the rooms at the Banff Hotel in Calgary. For almost $30.00 you can get a 7/11 convenience store type sandwich at the Americano Cafe.A Starbucks coffee and a pastry will set you back a mere $16.00. If you want to take a shower after you work out bring an extra $40.00. I'm a Diamond member which means absolutely nothing.
50,Great hotel middle of the strip easy access to everything in Las Vegas. Excellent customer service as well as the hotel it self. There is everything you can imagine. You don't need to go elsewhere for Las Vegas experience. Have Fun....
50,"I am a long time Ceasars' loyalist and have always loved their Diamond Lounge because of their incredible service and though the name is now the ""Laurel Lounge"" the service by Lynda McKnight is beyond outstanding. With the many people she takes care of daily in and out of the lounge it's amazing that she remembers not just names but facts and truly cares! Please tell her hello from me! Thanks for having someone so dynamic on your team in front of house! Cheers Laura"
20,I‚Äôve been to Las Vegas a few times and have always been impressed with the hotels but Caesar‚Äôs was overpriced and rundown. I also found a bug in my bed. Would not recommend staying here. Next trip will definitely be going back to other hotels.
10,We were really disappointed with the service they provided us  They were try to charge us extra unnecessary and never full fill our request we made at the time of reservation and at the time of ck out .
50,Caesars Palace Las Vegas has amazing accommodations all their rooms are renovated I highly recommend the Augustus Tower beautiful renovated and convenient the location is awesome you cannot go wrong when staying in Las Vegas to stay at Caesar's Palace
50,Short overnight trip. Beautiful room clean. Simple checkin & out personable staff. Didnt win anything but... self parking is a hike from the front desk. Elevators were not busy room was quiet. We'd do it again.
50,What a fun trip and Caesars exceeded our expectations in all areas. We loved the Keith Urban concert and shopping at the Forum Shops. The staff in the casino is friendly and courteous. Thank you Caesars for a memorable trip.
50,My room was beautiful clean with everything I needed and has all the best restaurants! I didn't have to leave the hotel room for anything at all. I've been to Vegas many times but Ceasars Palace is by far my favorite. Full of excitement and fun!
50,Caesar Palace made my trip to Vegas awesome. The waitresses kept the drinks coming without having to wait. The background music and variety of machines was great. I will return to Caesar the next time I m in Vegas!
40,We love a walkabout in the Shops at Caesars Palace.  Great selection with lots of variety. The long-term shops are always consistent and yet there are new added and some missed. It's just a great experience and in the centre of the strip.
50,Love everything about the brand Caesars Palace and their other hotels. Hotel rooms are spacious opulent comfortable and worth every penny. Restaurants are too notch and endless shopping options. The availability of dog friendly rooms is awesome!
40,Rooms: Ok to good.  Food: OK to outstanding. Price way way up there.  Service: Poor to outstanding. Amazing turnover due to overmanagement.  However Annie in VIP checkin was great at my last visit.  In the past Michelle has also been great...very friendly.
50,Stayed in Augusta Towers on the 39th floor. LOVED the room and size. We were very comfortable for three people. Our room faced the Bellagio fountain. Sat on the sofa and watched water show. View as beautiful at night.
30,The rooms are nice Lost of tables and slot machines but I do wish they had more of an updated selection of slots. Seems there are to many of the same slot machines. Casino is big. They have the best Sports book.
40,The wife and I enjoyed our first trip to Las Vegas 2020 ! Good food and always friendly Caesars service . I would highly recommend staying at any Caesars property . Gordon Ramsay pub and grill is always our favourite
50,Caesar's hotel and casino in Las Vegas Nevada is a must stay and play! The front desk and dealers are light hearted and make the experience even better. The tables games and slot machines are top of the line and great dealers!
40,The room exceeded my expectations. Palace Tower rooms are fantastic large and generous in size. Extremely clean room. The Casino has an exciting energy and staff was overall friendly and helpful. Enjoyed my stay very much.
50,The atmosphere is very pleasant at Caesars and any of the Caesars properties and I enjoyed my 4 nights stay - the crew at all the table games are very professional and top notch even under pressure. Played craps 7 card flush at Caesars and roulette and black jack at the other properties and enjoyed all of it.
50,I would like to recomend a visit to Ceaser Palace in Las Vegas.The property is beautiful.There is plenty to doI just went around looking at all the statues and fountans one day the gambling was easy and the dealers very palite.This is one resort eveyone should see.
50,The decor is absolutely the employees are friendly and helpful there are lots of eating options to fit any budget the atmosphere is exciting there are many shop[ping options too. I love to stay here!
30,The suite experience as a VIP gambler was mediocre at best. I was placed in the dated wing the housekeeping only made the bed and didn‚Äôt take trash or tidy up it smelled and the VIP hotline host on duty was the most rude and condescending person I have ever dealt with. Extremely disappointed by the hospitality and wish I stayed at another property where you are valued and not treated like a second class citizen because you are a woman.
50,My overall experience was great. We love coming to Las Vegas and staying at Ceasars Palace. They take care of all of our needs and more. We laugh we cry we are excited and disappointed all in the same trip. You can't beat that. We won't stay anywhere else.
20,Room checked in from front desk however when we arrived our room it wasn't ready & we had to wait outside hall way till clean up also basic amenities was missing we had to ask. Felt that Shower room floor wasn't clean enough kind of greasy disappointed.
50,best place to stay at. very classy and center strip. This has the best buffet in town if you are a gambler they have tons of machines and a ton of table games. you will always find a seat. What more could you ask for?
50,Excellent property. The staff is helpful the rooms are spacious and clean and the casino is amazing! I love Caesars for the rewards system they have too. They send out the best offers to their players for free nights and tournaments among other gifts! Keep it up!
30,Loved Caesars Palace my whole life--but now a days boy is it hard to get in and out of the property. I'm sure that my experience was unique that my room was unattended for two days without housekeeping. My overall experience with Caesars over the past 30 years has been wonderful so this was a one off i'm sure.
50,Room was great my host is very accommodating - however it is not cheap to stay or play in Vegas. Always a great time so worth it every way. Ceasers entertainment does a great job for the most part - there are some things I have concerns or bad vibes about. I think gambling was very tight - house doesn‚Äôt give much advantage to the individual. However I get it gambling is gambling and they didn‚Äôt build Vegas off of winners.
50,We had a room at the Palace Tower. We really enjoyed how close it was to the casino and shops. We also ate at Mesa Grill and thoroughly enjoyed it. We also enjoyed shopping at the forum shops. The casino was very clean and staff was friendly.
40,Second year in a row company booked room here. Rooms are large and grateful they provide fridge for medical. No robes offered anymore to use during stay. Jacuzzi tub is nice. Relatively quiet facing forum courtyard in Octavius tower. Wifi was fast and reliable.
50,Caesars Palace is a beautiful hotel in a great location. The rooms are large and clean and if you get a view of the fountain you are truly blessed. Unlike some of the other hotels on the strip you will actually get bar soap and not a dispenser.    If you are looking for lower limit gambling tables just walk across the street to Linq or Flamingo.
50,Great place to stay. Our room had a great view of strip was large comfortable clean and the jet tub was a plus. Staff goes out of their way to assist. Fast friendly check-in and out. Great places to shop. Must see: Ceasars Free Show in the emporium.
50,This place is enormous. Luckily I checked in on a Friday afternoon and there was no line. I was given a great room with a pool view on an upper floor in the Julius tower they also accommodated hypoallergenic bedding. There‚Äôs countless different bars and restaurants of all price points. The casino and sportsbook were smokey but that‚Äôs to be expected. No pools were open at this time of the year.
50,Loved every minute of my stay here. Staff are always so attentive and welcoming. The hotel itself is beautiful.  If you fancy a lounge by the pool i recommend getting down early to reserve your lounger.    They are very hot on ID in this casino aswell i have a very young face for my age and constantly kept getting asked for my ID little bit annoying..but they are only doing their job.
50,Me and my family went to Las Vegas for winter break we decided to stay at 3 different top hotels to get the whole Vegas experience. Out of the 3 coming back Caesars Palace is at number one on our list. The decorations and service was great during our stay in Vegas we also tried out the Top Buffets: which even though you may have to wait in a long line to get a table Bacchanal... Hands down was the best in our opinion! It was one of the limelights of our trip I highly suggest going there and we plan to stay at this hotel again.
50,Becky assisted our team at checkin on 1/26 and I was staying at another property for the conference. She ensured that everyone was aware that there was an early check in charge and that it may provide a room. I asked if there was an additional room and she quickly looked and found me a room not advertised online. I was able to cancel and move and it made the entire trip better!
50,You want to be pampered? You enjoy being fussed over? Then Caesars Palace is the Hotel for you. I am amazed at the quality of service the employees provide each time we stay. Spotless rooms and great hotel amenities! We will return!
50,My daughter and I stayed at Caesar‚Äôs Las Vegas and was delighted with our experience. The rooms were very clean and staff was very kind and helpful. The buffet was excellent but very expensive especially on a weekend.
50,My son arranged a trip for us to spend some time together at Caesars Las Vegas. I arrived from San Antonio TX on time and checked into my room but my son's flight was held up over three hours in Dallas due to weather. His reservation was under his name and I couldn't check him into his room because it was under his name. He tried to call the hotel to allow me to check into his room with no luck. I went to the front desk and went up to one of the greeters directing people to the correct lines. Julia H. was a life saver. She pulled up my son's reservation as well as mine and gave me two numbers for my son to be able to call and get an answer so he could put my name on his reservation. He did so and Julia H. checked it and was able to check me into the room. Instead of just blowing me off she went over the top providing me with top notch customer service with a cheerful attitude. THANK YOU Julia H. service like yours is why I go to businesses like Harris Properties
10,Great hotel but some security staff members are prejuduice. Especially when you've nothing wrong and spent money on drinks already and spent more the last few times you had time to go there. Equality hotel this use to be. Otherwise on slow nights DO NOT GO. Some security members have so much prejudice and never bother white people that act crazy. Just patrons and guests who are not white. BYE FELICIA!!
30,This is my first time staying at Caesar's and would not necessarily return. The rooms are expensive to begin with and then they add $49 resort fee daily. The positives were: location mid strip large room (octavius tower) large bathroom (good shower) and nice bedding. The negatives were: no complementary coffee/tea in the room no bathrobes wifi only intermittently working (and can only connect 2 devices before being charged extra) no smart TV ( so no Netflix) dirty sofa broken safe (took more than hour to get it fixed) slow service in general (waiting at front desk waiting to sign up for rewards). Would try another hotel before staying here again.
40,decided to try Ceasars just for the history and reputation of the name. Liked it didn't love it per se. Little above our price range on meals drinks etc but liked it. As per other reviews I read yes the room was a little dated (we stayed in the Julius tower). Overall tho we liked it and would recommend staying there.
30,Caesars Palace is classy but for the price you can find much better in Las Vegas. The Forum and Julius Towers are small and the furnishings are barely 4-star for a property that promotes itself as 5-stars. CP will likely leave you disappointed given the price.
50,The Caesars resort is huge. We walked through the whole casino(premium shops and all) what I definitely recommend if you can swing it is The steak house Old homestead! The filet minion is too die for and you order lobster and it‚Äôs ready for you to munch on definitely worth every dollar
50,We stayed in the Octavius Tower and loved our room. The room was luxurious in every way from the amenities in the bathroom (jetted tub) to the linens on the very comfortable bed. The pool view was amazing. Highly recommend this tower.
50,I recently visited Caesar‚Äôs palace casino. It was very nice. It‚Äôs clean the people are friendly. I Ate at Bobby Flay‚Äôs Mesa Grill best meal ever! I don‚Äôt normally play at Caesar‚Äôs but will definitely go back!
50,The staff are friendly knowledgeable the Buffet is to die for. The excitement in the Casino floor. There are plenty to do not just gambling. I would recommend this place who wants to have fun. I certainly comeback.
50,First time at CP and my trip lived up to and exceeded all expectations. Mainly due to VIP hospitality host Alyssa Hasegawa. Please go through her for your travel inquiries. She set us up with Thai Massages in the SPA and it was an experiences that I am still feeling 2 weeks later.    If you can stay in the Augustus tower beautiful rooms!
50,beautiful resort love ceasar palace slot machine are great the atmosphere is fantastic this is where I stay everytime I go I could never get enough of this resort/ also there restaurant and buffet are exceptional.
30,The room I booked initially wasn‚Äôt the room I got. The front seat told me that because it was ‚ÄúCOMPED‚Äù I get whatever that is left. First time staying here and I KNEW I should‚Äôve stayed at the COSMOPOLITAN like always! Now I‚Äôm not no ‚Äúhigh roller‚Äù but I do gamble at Caesars casinos a lot and enough to comp rooms. The hosts there are not nice. They just assume that what you need isn‚Äôt something they can offer. They don‚Äôt take the time to look at your account or play before they send you to a different place. Gave 3 stars for the beautiful property but that‚Äôs about it. Don‚Äôt think I will return to this specific property because apparently they choose who they want to be nice to!
50,Best room I've had in Vegas by far (Octavius tower).  Good food (24 hr diner in front of elevators) good drinks good gambling (even is winning right)  Had a big couch to relax and big table to set up dining on!    Took a trip to start the new year and already planning on coming back here soon lol
20,The room was a nice large room with a living area but way overpriced old furniture it reminds me from the 70s in the Catskill Mountains a stale musty smell with nicked furniture shades did not close yes us upgraded to an automation system but did not work shades stayed open I was not able to sleep when I called to complain no one cared.  Customer service was outright terrible serious bad I asked or a hour late check the replay was for a fee $100  Asked for a med fridge it never arrived I used the ice bucket with ice instead  This was the 10th time I stayed Caesars Palace never had an experience like this before that‚Äôs is why I booked in the first place  I guess it will be the last.
40,Once again a fun trip to Vegas with some Caesars time included. Spa is always nice. Sportsbook has changed since my last trip and not as nice as before. Table and dice were what they were. Staff was friendly and professional
40,I‚Äôm giving Caesar‚Äôs Palace 4 stars. The two Queen room was clean and the beds were comfortable. The room tech was severely outdated however. The mini Keurig usually comes with a couple of pods. If you want coffee pods at Caesar‚Äôs you bring them with or pay $14 for a 4 pod extra charge. The room came with one of those no-touch refrigerators. You know the ones with $5 dollar cans of Coke. Also WiFi is limited to two devices. Anything more? Pay extra. The regular rooms honestly are no better than one you would find at La Quinta Inn & Suites in Rapid City South Dakota.    I felt I did more walking to get to essential hotel things than I‚Äôve experienced at the Bellagio or the Venetian. It‚Äôs a big space. Casual food options are ok. If you haven‚Äôt been to Vegas before or visit infrequently you will not notice the annoyances I did. Let me say the staff at Caesar‚Äôs it top notch. No problem there.    Location is awesome. Just north of Bellagio and ‚ÄúVegas‚Äù close to the strip you have access to everything Vegas. If you are going to spend your time out and about with your hotel room as a temporary crash pad Caesar‚Äôs is the place for you. If you want an integrated luxury experience from standard room to the strip I‚Äôd suggest the Venetian.
40,very nice and wonderful place. had a great time and lots of fun.  a lot of bars and cafes working around the clock. The nightclubs are wonderful and good music. I advise everyone to visit this place. thanks you so much CAESARS PALACE !!!
50,Room is cleanView was excellentAmenities presentedCheck in for sevenstar helpfull  People work ON front desk very polite and whole you eating had some coffee and offering water ON serve  Housekeeping is helpfull
50,Nice hotel good food great accommodations. Very comfortable bed and pillows. Dealers & bosses are all very nice. Great selection of games and slots and minimums are reasonable. Drink service is very frequent.
20,I was looking forward to my first stay at Caesars Palace but it wasn‚Äôt what I expected. The staff wasn‚Äôt as friendly and professional as they should have been. I was charged for a beer that wasn‚Äôt drunk from the refrigerator in my room. The box office sent me on the run a round for about 5 hours. I don‚Äôt plan to go back there any time soon.
50,We had a great time and the service was wonderful. Caesar staff catered to our needs. They helped us get great seats at great shows. We saw Ka and had wonderful seats. This show is quite amazing. We had breakfast at the Americana Grill and the service on the patio was wonderful with the waiters catering to our every need.
30,The room smelt of smoke  The toilet bowl was clogged and the hot water takes too long to get hot.  The help did repaired all the problems to make the room a plus. We will be visiting Caesars AC in a few weeks. Thank you Joe Somma and Michele Desantis for making our stay enjoyable.
50,Great location on the strip ambiance lucky slot machines and great selections of bars and restaurants makes this a perfect place to stay! This is our favorite resort on the strip. We will be back. Fun to be had.
40,Concert was awesome  Lots of tables to play at  Enjoy the d√©cor and atmosphere  Sports betting area was nice and new  Omnia is an amazing club with lots of room and get entertainment  would definitely go back
10,I was partially spending few nights at Wynn then I also wanted experience Caesars palace because I heard about the brand for a long time and never tried. It didn‚Äôt take long my hope changed to a disappointment. I was trying to checkin around 5 pm and they were saying room is not ready so we had to spend extra money to upgrade the room. Even if we were staying at the palace suite amenities and bed quality wasn‚Äôt anywhere near to Wynn. Bed was hard bath towel was thin and cheap amenities were low qualities. Bigger problem was everything takes forever. We ordered a room service at 8 then we had to call them multiple times because they didn‚Äôt come until 9.30. Hotel floors are smeared with smoke smells and not family friendly at all. I‚Äôll probably never use this hotel again.
50,The Caesars Palace is the Strip's Most Iconic Hotel World-Class Dining & Shows.  The Caesars Palace Las Vegas Hotel & Casino presents spectacular rooms service and entertainment. Come discover the world-renowned luxury that awaits you.    After a 17 million dollar overhaul the newly reopened Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's Palace offers diners one of the finest buffet experiences in Las Vegas Nevada.
10,Check in was horrible we asked to be near my mother as she had broken her leg and needs help quite a bit so when we booked our hotel the agent made notes that they requested us to be on the same floor if not least on the same tower. My mother had to navigate your ginormous hotel by herself as we proceeded to check in with no possibility of the same tower without upgrading for 50$ more a night. Outrageous to help someone old with a disability. Her first time staying at your place and will be the last if we can help it. We usually stay had Harrah‚Äôs Flamingo ect but since we were there getting a purse for your diamond guests we were obligated to stay at your hotel. The check in guy was extremely rude and at one point felt he was just flipping us off while he was typing with one finger. The middle finger. who types with one finger? Let alone that one. Check your video. It‚Äôs extremely inappropriate even if he does maybe ask him to change that because I felt that was his was of flipping us off without actually doing it because his attitude and demeanor had been terrible regardless. Still wanting to know how is it that months ago we requested to be in the same area and your GIGANTIC hotel can‚Äôt possibly accommodate two rooms next to each other? A diamond guest and two platinum guests. Now I know we‚Äôre not 7stars but where is the service? You‚Äôre completely booked? I highly doubt there was nothing they could do or move us. I had to walk my mom back to her room in the other tower every time because she was so nervous by herself (first time traveling without my dad who is now in a home so I assured her she'd be near us and fine.) So that started this weekend off bad.  Fast forward to our medical emergency when we had to leave on Monday morning at 5am. We left in a hurry as my husband‚Äôs eye sight suddenly and drastically diminished. Concerned we woke up at 4am and went to the airport to catch a sooner flight home to get to the doctor. Leaving in a hurry I had left my wallet in the hotel room. I had my photo ID but left my Dooney and Burke wallet with all my credit cardscashdebit card in the night stand. Freaked I called security and got a person names Sharon. Sharon proceeded to be so rude and how she couldn‚Äôt do anything until the person checks out. Now I‚Äôm understanding to a point especially if this was clothes or something else but this was my credit cards and cash I had up there. Unconcerned all she did was literally say ‚Äòwell that‚Äôs what
40,Room was nice. Sorry but did not like the extra charge for refrigerator but besides that it was nice and cozy. Employees where very nice and polite. Front desk was always a help with any and all questions. Overall very nice stay.
50,Our flight was delayed overnight so we decided to change our flight to the next morning. We booked a standard room Inline and hopped in a cab to Caesar‚Äôs. Upon arrival Kevin H helped us get checked in and upgraded us at no charge to a Palace Suite that was mind blowing. Every one we encountered was extremely helpful and made our extra night a very memorable one.    Visit Casa Fuente when you go and have a delicious mojito and a great cigar!!
50,Every January a group of us ventures to Caesar's Palace for a nice relaxing post holiday season holiday get away. Every year we have had the benefit of working with Emma when we check in. Emma is truly and amazing asset to the Caesar's Palace team. She helps make our couples get away weekend 10 tens better! We look forward to working with her for many years to come ü•∞
30,I booked 2 rooms for 3 nights for a family wedding. Although promised that we would be located together everyone was spread throughout the tower. The toiletries are very low-end and you have to buy the K-cups for the in-room coffee maker ($14 for 4 K-cups). Quite chintzy considering the room rate.
10,Don‚Äôt come in the winter. I booked with Expedia and they didn‚Äôt tell me the pools would be closed. Still had to pay the resort fee which Expedia says is for the pool. Complained to the hotel. Not their fault. No one helped with our luggage at check in. There are just machines. The manager was rude when I complained. Didn‚Äôt even care I was told by their staff to use the pool at the Paris hotel and that pool was also closed. Smells terrible. Don‚Äôt come here with kids. Don‚Äôt come here period.
50,Becky N was extremely helpful during check in. Offered us upgrade opportunities one of which we chose. Our room is amazing and without her recommendation we would have likely stuck with our initial reservation. Becky N is an outstanding associate of Caesars.
50,Very pleasant trip. We had a good time. I enjoyed the casino and our room was nice. I enjoyed doing some shopping and walking the strip during the day and then gambling at night. We usually fly to Atlantic City but this was a nice change
50,Saw Keith Urban Jannuary 2020 in Ceasars Palace Collesuem. The Facilities were well kept and had a fantastic time. Would definitely attend another show at Ceasars again. Sat in section 400 and still had a great view.
50,Room was great and stay was perfect. Keli was awesome at Seven Stars reception - definitely deserves to be recognized. We stayed in the Augustus Tower and had a great strip view. All and all it was a great stay with no complaints.
40,My friends and I visited Caesar‚Äôs Palace in January. We had a great time. The Casino was in good condition. We especially enjoyed the shopping!! We will definitely be visiting again. We found the Staff to be helpful and friendly.
50,My fianc√© and I had such a great time at caesars! From the restaurants to the spa to the nightclub Caesars had everything we needed to have a fun and memorable weekend together. I would absolutely love to stay here on future trips to Vegas and would recommend it to anyone who wants a hotel that you‚Äôll never want to leave the entire time you‚Äôre there.
10,My husband and I did the self check-in well our room was suppose to be free cause I‚Äôm a diamond well needless to say they put a hold for $200 then another hold for $569 so we had that for starters which we went and had them take the hold off and they said they did and we stayed 3 nights and as of right now our account is still on hold for $769 total so that‚Äôs been almost 5 days holding it which is ridiculous cause they was suppose to fax a code to the bank to have them release the funds needless to say they didn‚Äôt! That was our first and last trip to Caesars well Vegas anyways it sucked and the staff was not helpful what so ever! We are not happy at all with Caesars
40,"As Rookies from the state of Maine we were very happy with our first visit. The shuttle from the airport and check-in couldn't have been easier. A little extra charge to check in a couple of hours early was well worth it to be able to leave our luggage and begin exploring!  The room in Julius Tower was a little dated but being able to walk to everything was great.  The Betting was simple energy was great and the Keith Urban concert was ""Unbelievable""!  A lot of smoking but ventilation seemed good"
50,Love the Augustus tower. The elevator location is close to the Casino Cab line and pool. Also you will have a great view of the Strip and Fountain with some rooms. I always try and stay there when I can.
50,Caesar's Palace is our favorite place in Vegas. The location is great you can walk easily to many attractions. The food variety is the best in the area. Rooms are well kept and housekeeping is always helpful if you have additional requests.
40,Oh wonderful time the ATM machines were too costly for withdraws my restaurant experience was unprofessional in my opinion but that Don‚Äôt often happen. Need to offer more comps to your players I think that would be a great idea. And I have a problem on the crap table with one of the employees she was telling me where to direct my money when laying it on the tableI told her I did not like throwing my money into the center of the table to a person I would like to place it down and she can move it if needed
40,Nice property beautifully maintained. Center strip with lots of nightlife if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for. Parking is pricey! Employees are professional and attentive. Gaming was adequate but the table limits are too high.
40,Food was delicious wish I had more time to experience all that is offered there. Gaming is endless many many options in different areas. Beautiful facility next time I will have to book my stay here at Caesars
50,From check in to check out Caesars Palace was first class all the way. Bryon at check in went above and beyond being accommodating. We had a beautiful Forum Classic suite that made the trip that much better
40,The rooms were clean and facility was very nice. Restaurants were a bit pricey but food was good. Barb at the concierge was very helpful in getting us a dinner reservation at Hells Kitchen at the time we needed
20,The staff was not helpful and the spa was dirty and under staffed.I almost fell due to the water on the floors next to steam bath-this happened multiple days. The attention to detail is not what I expected or received in the past.
50,The room were great. We had the best view of all. Our room was a little far at the end but was worth it. Our room was included Jacuzzi so we enjoy spending our time in there for at lease a couple hours a day.
40,It is what it is nice clean good service pretty good location on the strip way over priced at its stores inside the little market centers the table games need to lower minimums during slow hours especially.
50,Room was beautiful and very clean. Staff very polite! Loved the shopping center and the amount of restaurants at this hotel. The registration was quick and easy. Would definitely stay at this hotel again.
50,Rome was excellent gambling was fair place was safe and clean. Excellent experience. The buffet was actually as good as the buffet at the Wynn Casino which is one of the best in Las Vegas. We ate there three times and we're pleased each time. Excellent selection of food. Very busy.
40,Awesome experience. Hotel was fabulous. I stayed in the palace tower and the renovations to rooms was very nice. Loved tge sleek jet tub. Much needed to take a soak after walking around on strip. Food fun and casino was nice.
50,Food and atmosphere are awesome here. Bejing Noodle House is awesome as well as Nobu and Old Homestead. Dealers and pit bosses are friendly waitresses drop by pretty often asking if you want drinks. A very wide range of games to play. If you like slots there is more than enough to keep you happy.
40,I‚Äôll be back in February for another visit. Got my butt kicked at the tables but I‚Äôll get them next time! Service great and great food at all the restaurants. Great place to see a concert. Room was nice and the staff was attentive every time I asked for something.
50,Excellent rooms with good gaming options and a friendly wonderful host. The Homestead Steakhouse and Gordon Ramsey's Pub were tremendous. Unfortunately I have had two poor experiences at Rao's and will not be returning.
50,Room was amazing. Spa was amazing. Restaurants always on point and the shops are bar none.  The location it central to touring the city and the views from the rooms of the strip are always breath taking.
50,I was in Vegas for a Keith Urban concert and stayed at Ceasars since he was performing there. I had a great time. The rooms were large and very nice. There were ample choices of restaurants and gambling options.
50,The property was beautiful. The restaurants are great. The gaming is excellent. We didn't stay at the property but we visited it for the reasons I mentioned above. I've always enjoyed the amenities at Caesars.
20,Very disappointed in the poor gaming experience. No payouts no fun. Seemed as if no one was even hitting small payouts. Drink service was sporadic at best. Hotel was mediocre and rooms were fairly spartan. Beds were comfortable. Food was ridiculously expensive.
50,Very nice room. Stayed in the Palace towers. My favorite casino on the strip. I wish they didnt fill the fridge in room with overpriced beverages that I dont want. Would be nice to be able to use for my own drinks but sign in toom says I would be charged $75 if I removed item from fridge. Most cheap motels come with a fridge...
50,The entire staff was very helpful and courteous. Excellent check in and easy. Food was excellent at the Americana and all the staff there really hustled. The Conceierge was helpful to us in getting directions. We had a mix up with our tickets to Keith Urban but we received personal service to get it taken care of. All was good
50,The room was awesomely CLEAN!!!!Service people was really great always available courteous friendly  helpful and respectful... Safety was always ensured.My satisfaction was always their concern.Especially the foods!!!
50,Just checked in as a diamond member in the separate check in area and received truly exceptional service from an employee named Leallysa. It‚Äôs amazing how a person treating others even beyond how they wish to be treated can make such difference. What a great way to start my stay at Caesars!
10,Was visiting Caesars and got my money clip picked from my pocket. Lost almost $1000 my Driver's License and a few other items thankfully no credit cards. Within around 3 minutes I realized what had happened and tried to report it to Security. The guy could care less. He gave me a slip of paper with a website and said I had to fill out the report online. Then next day went back the lady gave me a piece of paper to fill out and said they would look at videos but that was about it. Does this happen so frequently its a common occurrence? Won't waste my time or money there again. How TRULY DISAPPOINTING.
10,All around terrible experience at check in and check out. Had to switch from a smoking suite to a non smoking regular room but hotel refused to change price. Managers were rude and clearly lied to us and would not give us any price info on the non suite room other than they had to charge the suite price. Very unprofessional. At checkout we had a 100 gift card but their system was not working so they could not apply so I am stuck with a gift card for a hotel I am not going to return to. This was a six night stay and started bad and ended bad. Much better choices on the strip. No reason to be treated like we were. It is amazing how they have no concept of customer service
50,Best Show I‚Äôve ever seen! So much more than a concert! Not a bad seat in the Colosseum. The charge for parking is my only complaint I have at Caesars. The food is great employees wonderful rooms are nice. Numb‚Äôs are the best drink in Vegas. Great experience!
50,great facility and great food. I have been using the Harrah's facilities during the past 20 years and always enjoyed their hotels food casino and shopping facilities. i recommend the Harrah's facilities to anyone who plans a vacation to Vegas.
50,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Caesars Palace. Our room was awesome clean and very comfortable. The text concierge is a great idea and was very helpful. Staff is very helpful and accommodating. My only criticism would be that food and beverage prices are way too high as compared to other similar casinos so we actually did not eat or drink much here as it was too expensive. For example a water coffee bowl of fruit and a muffin at Pronto (Giada‚Äôs place) was $27.00 US. Crazy. A beer at the bar was about $15 for a glass of draft. Considering the price of the hotel room I would have thought they could offer better pricing on food and beverages. The same items at the mirage next door are about 30% cheaper when comparing the same food items (I.e eggs benny at the mirage = $19 Caesars was $26.
50,We had the best front desk service from Tomek at the Caesar‚Äôs Palace. We mistakenly reserved a smoking room and he found us a better room that was nonsmoking. The view was amazing and he was able to keep us in the same tower. Great service and incredibly kind. Thank you Tomek!
20,Usually stay in the Augustus tower which is the best one to stay in. Have tried to use the kiosks in the lobby for an ‚Äúexpress‚Äù check-in and those NEVER work‚Äî3rd time to use and did not work.    Booked a room in Augustus tower and was ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù to a suite in the Octavius Tower‚ÄîAWFUL!!!!! Room smelt of smoke Keurig was dirty hot water took 5 MINUTES to get hot couldn‚Äôt open fridge door due to cabinet set up. No Keurig coffee k-cups called housekeeping to ask for some never received. Was a hc accessible unit (not told that at check-in) Shower curtain!--have never seen that at a hotel for a nice shower only bathroom and especially since this was a suite. Hand held shower sprayer was horrible. Hall dirty with trash. Room definitely in need of upgrading. Far too many other hotels to book than this one.
50,Excellent hotel to relax except no chance to roam inside can't walk too far!! Need more Asian cuisine and free water inside the room. Need shuttles to go on a trip to strip and charge us a little bit that help business as usual.thank you so much
50,Stayed at Caesar's for a short mid-week vacation. Saw Absinthe and O at the Bellagio. Wonderful. Also saw the Bellagio water show Bellagio spa and the High Roller. Learned how to play craps and played blackjack without breaking a sweat.
50,Maria the morning front desk agent was wonderful so caring and happy made our stay a very pleasant experience. From the room to customer service this property never fails us.we will return hopefully we can stay in June. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a very comfortable bed and great surroundings.
30,Stayed in a Laurel Collection Augustus Strip View room and was underwhelmed. The room was supposedly recently renovated but showed signs of wear and a lack of attention to detail in housecleaning. The slider dimmer switch in the bathroom was filthy with grime and the paneling on the exterior of the tub was kicked in and not attached well. The bathtub faucets spun around and never truly stopped in an off position. Windows were smudged all over on the inside and hadn‚Äôt been cleaned in a long while. The was nothing spectacular about the room in any way. The was disappointing as this was the highest level of room quality offered outside of their luxury suites. Just wasn‚Äôt worth the price. Would rather stay at the Signature for half the price. Would definitely recommend a room at Aria or Vdara for the same cost. Even the view was a let down due to the interior cross frame that broke up the view and lack of floor to ceiling windows as they have in the newer resorts. Just not worth it in my opinion.
50,"I stayed at Ceasar's in Jan 2020. As a Diamond Ceasar's Reward member I can usually get comp'd rooms here on weekends if I book early enough. I usually stop by Vegas for 1-2 days on my way home from business travel to relax. This time I got a premium king room which was large and had even larger bathroom with whirlpool tub. I didn't do the Bucchannal Buffet this time but if you're a seafood lover it's a must! I don't like buffets but this one is worth it for the seafood selection! I""ve only eaten the seafood w hen I go there so I can't tell you how anything else is. The new Vanderpump Gardens is a fun place to have drinks and appetizers with friends but beware it's pricey and they don't serve full dinner plates (at least not when I was there). I didn't have a concert to go to this time but I've been to concerts at The Colosseum and that's a great venue conveniently inside the casino. Location on the center of the strip is great. There's a bridge directly infront of the casino that allows you to cross over to were The Cromwell is. From there I walked over to Paris which I also like alot a couple of times. You can also work to the shops infront of Bally's very easily. I usually try to stay at Ceasar's when I can get a comp'd room even if I'm going to walk to other casinos because of the great location. Lastly I get great liqour service at the slot areas in Ceasar's. At some casinos you wait forever to get a drink but they come around alot here."
50,This was honestly an AMAZING experience! It was our first time staying at Caeser's Palace and we had a compd room it was 2 beds but we we're just excited to be staying there free. When checking in we talked to a really nice employee named Daniel who asked if we would like a single king bed. (It was just my bf and zi traveling) He said on our 2nd night of the nights we could be placed in a really nice room with a king bed FREE. DUH we took him up on the offer and HOLY MOLY SO GLAD WE DID! We booked the octavious tower 2 queen bed room which was beautiful and had a HUGE bathroom!! A jacuzzi type tub and 2 mirrors in the bathroom tons of free water too and free loofah!! The 2nd night we were moved to A JUNIOR SUITE at julious tower FACING THE STRIP!!! I LOVE CAESER'S PALACE and plan going back there many more times! I could see Belagio fountains from my room!! Amazing way for my bf and I to experience our first Vegas trip of 2020. Thank you Caesers Palace!
50,Great variety of games and places to eat. Friendly staff and a great location. Rooms are always kept up and they have a variety of room locations If you like to shop they have many wonderful shops. Their poker room staff are very friendly.
50,The casino is very clean and safe. The smoke is also not as strong inside when you are gambling. The management staff was very helpful and wanted to make sure we did not have any problems when we were getting our rewards cards.
50,My wife and I enjoyed our stay at Caesars Palace where we celebrated our anniversary. This hotel offered everything that we needed to celebrate from a nice quite breakfast at Mesa Grill to the most entertaining sports book Caesars offered everything we needed from a Vegas trip.
50,The Suite was totally unexpected and included master suite bedroom and bath. The seclusion of this room allowed for complete privacy. The bed was perfect. We loved the experience. I am looking forward to our next stay with Caesar‚Äôs Palace.
50,Husband & I went to Vegas for the 1st week of Jan 2020 not knowing it's the same time as the huge CD something (computer technology) convention. We stayed at the Caesars Palace in the Palace Tower. Our room was spacious and looked over the roman pools courtyard. Caesars Palace is huge with lots of restaurants a massive Forum Plaza Shopping mall (think indoor but expensive shops strip mall). I will warn you the prices for food will be higher than you expect - so research and prepare that in your budget ! The food is very good (but $100-120 with tip for lunch was our average). The casino itself has a great mix of slots/video poker/table games/poker & off betting. The staff and service is A+ We did not run into anyone that was not willing to answer anything or do what they could do to make our stay feel special and grand. Can't wait to return and will come back to the Palace.
50,Over all great trip. Great services very nice rooms. The new Years party vas the best yet. Very much enjoyed tne fireworks. We have been coming to Vagas for over 30 years and this was the frist time staying at Caesars.We will be back to stay again.
50,Great customer service- smiles greet you at every corner. Everyone seems very knowledgeable and eager to help. Room was cozy and had a good view of the Bellagio Fountains and Strip. Overall great experience!
50,We had an excellent dinner at the Water Grill before attending the Keith Urban show in the Coliseum with a group of coworkers.  Most of them had never stayed at Caesars but now they know why it's our favorite hotel in Vegas!
50,I last visited Las Vegas in 1960 to the old original SANDS when the Rat Pack was ruling the strip. This trip my wife suggested Caesar's Palace and The Forum...great places second only to Fremont Street Experience. We shall return.
50,Such a beautiful hotel love staying here. Staff is friendly and players benefits are by far the best in town. Brought my parents with us this trip and they both left with players cards and tons of points already accumulated. Cant wait to come back!
20,I really don‚Äôt get why people like Caesars Palace. It‚Äôs a humongous hotel with a lot of shops and restaurants inside the hotel but other than that I don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs so special about it. It is incredibly smoky which I guess it is to be expected of a casino but it doesn‚Äôt make it any less awful. You can feel the difference in the freshness and cleanliness of the air the second you walk in to the hotel. If you have allergies or respiratory problems be prepared (or stay somewhere else). They do have non-smoking rooms but you will still be exposed to a LOT of second-hand smoke everywhere else in the hotel.
40,It was New Years Eve and Ceasars was very busy but well staffed with friendly and experienced people. My room was very clean and comfortable. I really like how it is centrally located on the Strip. Prices as expected were think of high but normal and as expected for The Strip.
50,Have visited Vegas over a dozen times but this is the first time I stayed at Caesars. What a fabulous experience and I wouldn't hesitate to return. It's situated in the middle of the strip so it is easy to visit other hotels without too much walking. The rooms are large and comfortable and I found the service to be first class with always a friendly helpful person available if needed. Stayed here over New Years Eve and the fireworks were spectacular and the atmosphere on the strip remarkable. The only tiny criticism I would have is that the atmosphere in the casino is quite smokey and irritating on the eyes.
20,After driving 10 hours I arrived to the hotel and my room wasn't ready. I contacted my host and an hour or so later I was given a room but it wasn't at the hotel I booked. My room had great views of air conditioner ducts.    The casino floor is in need of a major overhaul. The cigar and cigarette smokes linger in the air. If you don't like smoke definitely don't go here to gamble.    I enjoy Qua Spa although it is need of a deep cleaning. As you walk up to the entry to the spa there is a reception area where you check in. Behind the reception area is a water feature that is green with algae and other bacteria. Everyone can see it and I'm unsure as to why it hasn't been cleaned in months.
50,The boys went to enjoy the football playoffs. Caesars did and as always took very good care of us. We enjoy hanging at one bar/area and interact with the bartenders and wait staff. They make you feel like family and not just a job for them.
50,Room was great pizza place was phenomenal. Staff was friendly. Great trip!  AugustusTower. 43rd Floor  Super fast elevator to the 43rd floor. Note: water in jacuzzi tub has to cover the silver dot before it will turn on!!
50,We have spent time in many Ceasar‚Äôs properties (Ceasars Planet Hollywood Ballys Paris Flamingo etc... All have been wonderful. Highly recommend them. The poker rooms and other gaming options are lots of fun. The food was great everywhere. We especially enjoy the buffet at Ceasars. The other buffets as well are good but Ceasars buffet is over the top.
50,Caesars gave me the best room that I‚Äôve gotten on my Vegas trips my family was shocked at the view. We never get the view that Caesars gave us and the stay was perfect. Services and their team was perfect making me feel like home in a way
50,Checking in was a breeze and the rooms were clean and comfortable. Gaming was great. Great places to eat and entertainment was very nice a lot to choose from. Parking was easy and very easy to get to your room.
50,Caesars is in the middle of everything .The staff are very friendly and helpful . Lots of places to eat and a lot of tables games . It also would have been a good place to bring the family . I came to play with my wife and had a great time there .
50,Everything you need for a great night out. Good lounge good play and an excellent auditorium for the show. Could not have been a better night. Vanderpumps is worth giving a try and Keith Urban put on a show that was very energetic. Staff at the venue did a good job keeping the crowd in line.
50,The shopping and dining options are outstanding. The staff is friendly and helpful with all my requests. The slots and tables are exciting and fun for all to play. The decor sets the stage for a great casino experience.
50,The rooms at this property are above my expectations  I made my restaurant reservations in advance and got emails reminding me of my reservation. We were seated as soon as we walk into the restaurant. The Mesa Grill menu has something for everyone. Everything we had was outstanding.
50,Everything was outstanding except the price of a cup of coffee. VERY CLEAN SECURE PERSONABLE. Was upgraded to a spectacular room. Was a perfect place for work or adult play. (not the best place for the under 21 crowd)
30,Really disappointed with my room. It was literally worse than a room I paid $114/night for at Bally's and my corporate group rate was $200 plus we had a convention and spent tons of time and money at the casino restaurants. I went down and spoke to the manager who told me they couldn't change the room once I had accepted. When that room didn't have a working shower head and hairdryer it was housekeeping who spoke with management got them to call me and change the room. She kept telling me to talk with my corporate event planner about the negotiated room situation but my other colleagues got better rooms upfront. Really disappointed. For a top tier hotel & casino in a tourist city attracting people worldwide you would expect more experienced management who wouldn't let someone walk away dissatisfied without doing SOMETHING to make their experience better.
20,Had booked Caesars as a special Christmas trip with my family. As a wheelchair user had booked a roll in shower and had emailed ahead of time to confirm this. Arrived day before Christmas Eve and checked in. Room was fine appart from the roll in shower would not actually let my wheelchair roll in. Tried so hard the next morning to stand and have a shower but just couldn‚Äôt manage. Went to reception and was told by a very unhelpful lady at the desk they had no other rooms. Was so very upset. It left us with no option to check out Christmas Eve and find another hotel. Being a wheelchair user and unable to help this caused us so much stress and completely spoilt our day. What bothered me most was the total lack of empathy by the staff member. Had she even said sorry we can‚Äôt help you it would have made all the difference.
50,This is was my first time in Las Vegas and Cesars lived up to the hype. Everything you see in the movies. The place was very packed and lively. It has everything you need from top class restaurants Sportsbook and the casino. I will definitely be back.
50,Came for NYE 2020. Saw Journey in concert. We have seen them before in Houston they were off the chart incredible. A little bit disapointed in the vegas show. Stayed at Bellagio strip view of firework in our PJ's and chilled Crown Royal!
20,Seriously - one ply toilet paper? Water with nasty smell and metallic/oily taste? These are basics that Motel 6 does a better job with. For a luxury hotel - unacceptable! We had to move hotels just so we could brush our teeth in water that doesn‚Äôt taste like toxic waste.
50,We didn‚Äôt have to wait once we arrived to check in. Planet Hollywood room was extremely clean and quiet. The staff was amazing and very helpful.We had a great view of the strip and Bellagio fountains Room service was prompt and polite.
30,Not even a complimentary cup of coffee or tea. No refrigerator or micro wave. Grossly over priced snack bar.. 1 pack of M&Ms....$14.25.....2 small bottles of water....$18.38.....Room service bar...$34.59. This was my second stay at your hotel and my last
50,Had the pleasure of spending two nights at Caesars Palace in order to see a concert there. As soon as we drove up to park our car the great experience began. Greeted by a very nice Valet we were taken care of quickly and with a smile. Checking in we were helped by another nice person who happened to upgrade our room to an unbelievable suite! The room was nearly as big as our house! Every staff member we encountered was so nice and helpful. The grounds and rooms are well kept and even though my parents used to stay there in the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs the place is modern and beautiful with so much to do and see you will never have to leave. We haven‚Äôt been to Las Vegas in about 5 years and have never stayed at Caesars Palace before. When we go back we are coming back to Caesars Palace!
10,The rooms are outdated the carpets are filthy the jacuzzi bathtub full of pubic hair and NOT clean the service mediocre the hotel itself smells bad. No one at the concierge desk not sure if there is one... significantly misses the mark in comparison to Venetian and Bellagio also ‚Äòolder‚Äô hotels in Vegas. Don‚Äôt call yourself a ‚Äòluxury‚Äô when you can‚Äôt even provide bathrobe and slippers to go with jacuzzi bathtub (again filthy and dirty).
20,Decided to stay at Caesars Palace for my WIfe's Birthday. Checkin process was easy and the hotel was very nice. We checked in and went up to our room to get dressed and freshened up after a 7 hour flight. The room had a bad smell the bed had human hairs all over it including the pillows the tub had a grime inside of it the bathroom grout was brown from dirt and grime the shower was also grimy. The room definitely could use a deep clean. The maids only came once over a 4 day stay to deliver towels. Other than that we had no clean towels to use. Overall the hotel is very nice but the rooms are filthy.
40,This resort is massive. It is like 5 hotels in one. The rooms are very comfortable and the house keeping was prompt. I know all the hotels charge a resort fee but an additional $50 per day plus $40 for early check in for pretty much nothing is a bit much. The food and restaurants are VERY expensive. Coffee and muffin at Pintos was $15.(WOW) Las Vegas will get your money one way or the other. My suggestion is eat anywhere outside of the resorts. Spend a day at Freemont street. Well worth the bus ride.
40,We stayed in the octavius tower and boy was it a hike from the garage. I think nobu maybe closest to self park. Resort fees of $51 per night. Staff super friendly. Room needs minor improvement. Shower slow to drain. Some paint peeling. Rooms were very spacious and quiet. Location can‚Äôt be beat. Also $100 per night deposit and $18 per day parking. Soaking tub was a delight after a long day out.
40,Room was very good and have a good space.Housekeeping are very good staff and helpful showing us where is the ice machine room.There is enough machines and table for every one want to play.Food was very good with nice tasting.
50,wow you could spend days just exploring and getting lost in this hotel everywhere you look is just elegant the rooms are very spacious and the beds extremely comfortable. Hope to come back one day. Staff very friendly
50,The staff has been amazing. I made a mistake when I booked my reservation and didn‚Äôt have a room for the day I arrived. Emma and Maete made sure to get me in without a wait and even managed to upgrade my room. They went above and beyond. Thanks for a great visit.
50,Checking in sets the tone for your entire stay. Ray was delightful! Having been many times before he stood out with his genuine smile and caring for guests. Looking forward to going back and hope to see Ray again!
50,Everything was awesome. Would recommend 100%. Had an amazing meal at Hell‚Äôs Kitchen and Bacchanal buffet. If you only take one trip this year I would highly recommend Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Trust me!
50,From the time my wife and I arrived at Caesars palace we were amazed at all the things we could do. Probably first on the list is walking and gaulking at all the restaurants art statues or people watch. The gaming is exciting and the pay off is not bad either. The rooms are quiet and decorated beautifully. The restaurants are over the top.and the buffet is to die for.  The complete stay at Caesars is wonderful
50,It was our 9th anniversary so we decided to take in a concert and travel to Las Vegas. The Kieth Urban concert was at Caesars Coliseum so we booked and planned to stay for the weekend. Caesars Palace is huge and opulent and very impressive. The Coliseum is a perfect venue for concerts and we really enjoyed it. We also ate at Cafe Americano for breakfast and it was good. We ate 3 times at Carmines and all meals were excellent. As far as gaming goes we went to a couple of casinos but came back to Caesars as it was our favorite. The staff was very friendly and always helpful. To top it all off we also won more than the trip cost us. We will return.
50,The rooms are very clean with nice furniture and very comfortable. It felt like my home. Housekeeping is very nice and will not hesitate to assist you. I felt safe at all times. Security is always present at the entrance to whatever Tower you will be staying at. You could stay at Caesars to gamble shop at The Forum and there is a choice of restaurants. For your convenience Caesars does have a Post Office FedEx gift shop and other amenities.
40,This was the first time I stayed in Caesars Palace. We paid for upgraded to the smoking suite . The room was very nice clean. It‚Äôs smells good not like other smoking room. Very quiet during the night even we had a street view from our room. We have a lot of fun inside the casino as well.
50,Everyone very helpful and super gameing floor. The restruants was great alot of diffrent selections to choose from and I had great time at Gorden Ramsey restruant at the Paris the food was exceptional.
50,I spent a weekend at Harrah's Laughlin the gaming leaves a variety of choices. THe winning is amazing.. just gotta find that special game you like. Our room had a great view clean very welcoming. The beds were soft and comfy. The floor staff is out going happy and super quci to fullfill your needs.
50,It was great no complain and very clean and a amazing experience. All employees were well professional and very helpful. I come to Vegas 10 to 12 times a year and this trip was one of the best experience I ever had.
50,We have had a great time in Las Vegas! We stayed at Caesar‚Äôs Palace for this stay! Daniel checked us in and was very helpful with our room accommodations! Everything about my experience was at Caesar‚Äôs was great! I forgot an item in my room and when I went up to retrieve it they were cleaning my room. When I told the woman cleaning the room that I only needed to grab one thing she would not let me do that until I used my room key to show it was my room! I very much appreciated that added bit of security that my belongings are safe! Definitely will stay here again!
40,First time ever staying at Caesars Palace. The room was large two bathrooms view king bed and sofa bed. Price around $250 a night. Downside very large hotel a lot of walking to move around to where you want to go however the casino felt small. A lot of little restaurants. We went to see a show. Next time i think i will try Nobu Hotel and Nobu restaurant. I would call the hotel/casino better than Excalibur less than Wynn or Bellagio. have fun @nickellfamilytravel
50,Caesars is b b always a great casino to visit. Employees are friendly and helpful. The hotel is clean and has many food options from high end restaurants to a great food court. I LOVED Vanderpumps cocktail lounge. A must if you are at Caesars
50,Clean and very nice rooms. Friendly and efficient staff always willing to help. Great location and easy to get back and forth from the strip. Nice selection of food and restaurants in the hotel and awesome shops.
20,I got a very bad backache after I came back from this trip because of old and soft matress. I love 7 cards high flush but opened very late reminded me casinos in cruz. Also I love wild 2 but was only in Flamingo casino.
50,We booked a room at Caesars because my husband's company was having a convention there the following week. I had never been to Vegas so we decided to come in the previous weekend. I read some of the reviews on the hotel just before we arrived and was a little nervous. We stayed in the Palace Tower and it was a beautiful room! It was clean and updated I've never stayed in a hotel room that nice before. That being said we did not touch the mini bar provided snacks or the coffee machine. We will review the bill after my husband checks out and compare it to what we are charged to make sure there are no discrepancies. There are plenty of CVS and Walgreens around. We bought a 6 pack of water to have in the room and got our own snacks. The hotel is massive!! Get ready to walk a lot. Eating at the restaurants in the hotel is quite expensive but there are lots of options.
50,The room was comfort that you were able to control the thermostat yourself. Love the bathroom it was amazing. One day cleaning staff didnt clean too well not vacuum but all in all we had a great stay. This was my daughter first trip to Vegas and she loved every moment.
10,I was given the option to check in online early morning of the day of travel. I checked in and I was given a room number assigned as well. by the time I got there they gave me a room in a different tower away from my other friends. Management didn‚Äôt have a good answer why that was changed and the lady didn‚Äôt seem to be really cared she just shrugged her shoulders and said really sorry. you can tell she wasn‚Äôt sorry at all she had a smirk on her face. Terrible customer service experience
50,Casino Host Yi-Li is the best. Makes this place feel like a second home and we always a great time. The arrangements are always accurate and we always leave impressed with the level of hospitality we receive.
50,Sign up for the Caeser's Rewards Program I signed up last year and enjoy the perks of the property while staying there. Rooms are neat and comfy staff are friendly and helpful. Overall a great time was had!!!
40,Agustus towers nice rooms comfy beds huge resort lots to do and see great location on the strip lots of choices for dining ... took a really long time to get an attendant at slot machine to payout a jackpot and put boss was slightly rude and grumpy but overall great place
50,Service and employees are perfect. The design of the resort is very great. Everyone is friendly and a lot of shops and restaurants that you can select. The view of the resort rooms is fantastic and nice.
50,Caesars is one of the nicer properties in Vegas location is just perfect on the strip. Rooms are large nice and very clean. The walk to Octavious rooms is very long and lonely some video tvs or something to make it less boring would be nice. We ate at the Bacchanal buffet it was AWESOME. Only complaint is that they do not give you slot credits during the double-up phase of your Video Poker play. Good new is that they have double up feature active on most games.
50,We wanted to pass along some compliments for Annie in the VIP registration area. She is always very courteous and efficient. We appreciate her service in getting us registered in a timely manner paying attention to details and any concerns we might have. Thanks for a great job!
40,We stayed at Caesars over New Years... it has a great location on the strip... lots to see and do near by... check in was fast and painless... we stayed in the Augustus tower... newly facelifted and away from casino floor traffic... i can not begin to describe how happy i was with the entire experience... and we will be definitely staying at this property again...
30,Dirty carpet high prices rude dealers. $60 room service breakfast was pretty good and included tip. $16 beer in restaurant crazy. Mae the flush dealer was awful and rude but Tim was friendly and nice.
40,Dining at Ceasars Palace is always great. Raos was top notch! And tha casino was very fun and layout friendly. I would have loved to spend more time - but we had to go see a show. Everyone should try their dining options.
40,We celebrated a family birthday recently with all staying at Caesar's. We booked the Augustus Tower dinner reservations at Rao's and Mr. Chow. Rooms were large clean updated and well located. Food was excellent. Concierge service was incredibly helpful (thank you Ivy!) Close proximity to The Linq area. Rooms well priced. Solid destination Vegas Strip hotel!
40,Our room is spacious with brand-name amenities quiet and non-smoking. The room is clean with fluffy and large towels that gives Caesar Palace a notch above other casinos on the strip.  The whole hotel gives us a sense of safety comfort and luxury.
50,I cant imagine staying anywhere else in Vegas! This hotel has it all. You literally do not even need to leave this place to enjoy Vegas. They have all the shopping you could dream of happy hours brunch restaurants entertainment etc... This hotel is amazing. Right from the start the front desk agent was so friendly and accommodating. Our room was huge and super clean. We had an incredible view of the pool. We came in the off season so the pool was closed but we cant wait to come back when it is open. We caught Happy hours in many of the restaurants including Seersucker and Sushi Roku. We ate at The Palms Hell's Kitchen and Sushi Roku. We also enjoyed the magnificent buffet at Baachanal Buffet ( They offer bottomless bubbles for $20 more- well worth it)! The location is prime we were the perfect distance from everything and even walked to and back one of the shows we went to. All the staff we encountered was super friendly and really went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. Management was incredible as well. The casino is clean and well kept. We have recommended this hotel to anyone traveling to Vegas that wants to have a five star stay We cant wait to come back!
40,"The room was beautiful and super clean. Everyone was very nice and friendly. Bring your own Keurig pods - they charge $14 for 4. They came into our room without our knowledge to look at what we took from the mini bar (even though we had the do not disturb sign on the door). They charged us for something from the mini bar that we never took. And they never explained what the $51/day ""resort fee"" was for. I knew there would be a fee but they never mentioned it at check in and I forgot to ask about it. It's for use of the work out room (that would have been nice to know!!!) and for wi-fi. Which was BAD. Very spotty."
50,Love love love this hotel! Bryan was amazing / he helped us get a beautifully upgraded room that had a fantastic view of the Bellagio fountains! And my fianc√© who is a veteran was treated with such kindness and respect. Will only stay here in the future!
40,Great bed & great shower!!! Most convenient location on the strip; easy access from Las Vegas Boulevard & rear entrance. Walk to other main resort casinos on both sides of the strip. Very good eateries in & around the resort. Great valet service & people!
50,Caesars Palace Las Vegas has the nicest rooms of all of the Caesars Las Vegas properties. Their rooms are upgraded and the nicest in Vegas. We have stayed at all of the properties. They also have the best selection of restaurants like Nobu The Old Homestead Steakhouse and Gordon Ramsey Bar and Grill. They also offer a large variety of high end shopping. The layout is open and allows you explore the property.
50,The room was excellent with a great view of the strip and pool. The various amenities include everything you need from food to entertainment. After our workout we had an amazing steak dinner then watch the divisional football playoffs in the sports book.
50,Had a great experience overall. All our questions were answered and service was nice and easy. The Caesars is so beautiful and absolutely clean! Love it! They have the best restaurants and shops! The overall experience was a 5 star!!!!
50,We loved the rooms with views the food the casino the shopping at the Forum shop etc. All in the same hotel. Everything is great. It‚Äôs the best and a must place to visit and enjoy when you come to Las Vegas.
30,Nice average venue. Competitive rates. Steakhouse is not bad. Nobu buffet and spa are not worth it (save your money). A lot of shops and restaurants you will enjoy. Nice poker room. Omnia is average.
50,Everything about our stay at Caesars was perfect. We arrived with another couple and the reservations had us staying in separate towers. The lady that checked us in was able to put us in the same tower AND have connecting rooms. We had a great view of the strip and the room was very clean and spacious. Everything at Caesars was top notch.
40,Our room was gorgeous the view was tremendous management was very helpful. Just don‚Äôt try to eat at the buffet. The wait was 3 hours on a Thursday night at 6:00 and 3 hours On a Friday at 4:00. A little insane.
10,Classic example of a hotel living only of its fame. Please note we paid over 500 USD per night on this hotel. The first thing we found in our room was a used underwear from the previous guest in our closet. Then noted that there was dust all across the closet and all our clothes were going to girt really dirty if we put them there. Their personel took over 1 hour to come and clean. Then we noted that there we no complimentary waters on the room and when we called to ask for some they told us that it was not possible to bring water as their policy was to give free water only in the casino so you could play at the same time. The drop that spilled the glass was the towels. They looked like towels of a dirty motel and not Awfull experience and profoundly dissapointed.
50,I‚Äôm the past 3 weeks I‚Äôve been lucky enough to visit Las Vegas twice. One for fun with the family and last week on business for CES. I have to say that the rooms and customer service of the Caesars Palace is much better than the Bellagio. The rooms are very spacious and the staff is very nice and helpful. It was a nice experience. It has a couple of nice restaurants like The Pub by Gordon Ramsay.
50,"Palace Tower. Single king. Comfortable. I spent more time in room than usual. I was getting over a bug and it was nice to have a quiet place to take a break during my recovery. I do have to say and I know ultimately it's my fault that some of the buttons on the bacchanal bar poker machines don't respond at times. I had 4 cards to a straight flush and held the 4 cards and hit draw. My card came and it turns out one of the cards I thought I had held didn't get registered and took my straight flush away. Took me like 5 minutes to get over that 4k ""miss."" So disappointing."
50,The experience was everything expected and more. Everyone was helpful and great spirits. The location is perfect. The check-in and check-out could not be easier. The bedding was extremely comfortable. Great way to celebrate a memorable day!!
50,so much of a stay is dependent on how your treated at check-in. Wanted to send a big thank you to leallysa at check-in. she made the process seamless. She Was so willing and able to get everything set up for me. Extra effort by her is so appreciated. Set the tone for another great stay at Caesars
30,This place is way over crowded and they tables are all pretty high priced. All that is fine but they don‚Äôt even include a cup of coffee. Coffee in your room they charge more than 2 devices on their Wi-Fi they charge also $50 a day resort fee but I‚Äôm not sure what that was for since they charged for everything. The room was clean and quiet. Just be aware when they give you a great deal on the room that you will pay for everything!
50,Just WOW! Incredible resort absolutely breathtaking. Rooms comfortable and clean. Right in the heart of the action and you don‚Äôt even have to leave the hotel. Pity guest services are not so friendly!
10,Rude staff they only try to squeeze you money out. Asked $30!!!!!!!! For an email reminding us when the checkin was available. Made us wait 3 hours for checking in without giving our room earlier than 4PM while obviously the room was ready: just to try to upgrade us and squeeze more money out of us.    Only 2 devices for internet seriously??? Are we in 1990????? Extra devices $15 per day!!!    Bottle of water: 8.5$!!!!! Crazy    Not even complementary coffee or tea bags: next steps they will charge you for the air you breathe.    Really disappointed they pretend to be a premium hotel but they are cheap and you trip can‚Äôt be comfortable unless you have you credit card with you all the time. Don‚Äôt go to this place
40,We had the opportunity to book a room the day after the New Year. We had a horrible experience at Planet Hollywood. Thank Goodness their sister company Cesars took very good care of us. We had a nice evening and day visiting the Forum shops the food court and just resting. Our rooms were nicely appointed clean and not smoky . Thank Goodness. Our lungs needed a break after leaving Planet Hollywood. The check in was a little tough because I had two rooms and the self service machine referred me to a representative. The rep . could not get the machine to work either so she directed us to a line. We waited about 10 minutes but everything went smoothly from there. No complaints. All was well. We have only had great experiences at Cesars in the past. We had never visited the food court but had always eaten at the restaurants on property. My family enjoyed the change for that day.
20,Didn‚Äôt feel very welcome had to pay $40 per day resort fee for resort that was closed WiFi hardly ever worked couldn‚Äôt use the gym buffet was extremely expensive $40 per person per meal but food was less than average
20,"The 2 rooms for myself and business colleague not ready at 1:30pm so we were offered the Rainman"" suite for modest upgrade. 3000 sq ft of wasted space. The room is so dated. Wallpaper peeling off everywhere damaged carpet and ancient technology. Do not fall for the ""upgrade"". Maybe the Forum Tower is the last to be uograded?"
40,We arrived to the hotel on NYE afternoon and the place was packed with thousands of people! Checkin was a breeze and the rooms were very clean! Customer service was on point. Grabbed a bite to eat at the food court.
50,My wife and I always enjoy our time at Caesars. The property is like a city in itself. There are many options for great shopping including the premium shops at the Forum wing and the choices for restaurants range from a food court to world class dining at several of the restaurants without leaving the property. The Casino is unmatched anywhere with every gaming option imaginable. There is a fantastic buffet that you have to experience to believe and an excellent Spa and pools.
10,Booked through Southwest Airlines/Booking.com. Was charged $850 for the first day when the rate was closer to $300. Caesars said it was a Booking.com issue and Booking.com said it was a Caesars issue. Terrible customer service. Probably will never go back there and definitely won‚Äôt use Booking.com
50,hotel and everything was lovely staff was great. We how ever couldn‚Äôt get into the nobu restaurant and nor could the hotel get us a reservation and the nights we tried to go in they didn‚Äôt even look busy.
30,The rooms are showing signs of wear They smelled pretty musty. The table limits were mostly $50 minimum. Most of the dealers were decent. Service was non-existent. I played Roulette for 1 hour and no one picked up my Players card sop that I could receive credit. I finally gave up and left the table.    On 3 different nights we rarely ever received service from the cocktail waitresses. On the 4th day we gave up and went to Harrah‚Äôs and PH. What a difference. The cocktail waitresses were amazing. The dealers were great and my Players card was picked up immediately each time.    On our next visit we will definitely stay t either Harrah‚Äôs or PH.
50,The buffet is great and we had a nice visit at Caesars Palace. The receptions are welcoming and nice meanwhile very knowledgeable with our questions. The casino staff are also very enthusiastic kind of the best among all casinos that we had been to.
50,Great rooms to go with a resort hotel. Knowledgeable and friendly staff. Outstanding selection of slot machines table games restaurants and shopping. Very clean and well maintained hotel rooms and casino
50,Very nice hotel & staffs. Lots of entertainment Casino Club Omnia swimming pools spa and many more. Great food most especially the Bacchanal Buffet! Good location very near to Las Vegas Premium Outlet.
50,They upgraded us to the ‚ÄúHakone Suite‚Äù for our anniversary celebration. They even gave us a comped wine bottle to enjoy!! Words can‚Äôt even describe how amazing the room is!! Zoey and Ivy were wonderful and very attentive!!
40,Loved that is steps away from the strip also dining and entertainment within the hotel are excellent. If you enjoy walking and site seeing this is the perfect place to stay it is literally steps away from various famous attractions in Las vegas.
50,Walked onto the casino floor with $200. Walked away with $2400. That's says it all. I'm definitely coming back. I usually gamble at other casinos in Las Vegas but now I will be gambling at Caesar's Hotel and Casino from now on. Plus the rooms are beautiful and clean.
50,Excellent! Loved everything about Caesars. The rooms were beautiful as always. Lots of restaurants to choose from. Slots and video poker were fun but table limits too high! I intend to always stay at Caesars from now on!
50,Went to Vegas for New Year's Eve and had a wonderful time at the Caesar's property. Absolutely no complaints. The service and hospitality was amazing. We had great dinners at Caesars including the best mashed potatoes ever.
50,My room first of all was available immediately. It was spacious clean with all the latest amenities. The bathroom was large clean fresh with a shower and spa tub separately.Fresh towels were present and if needed to changed by the maid staff who by the way was excellent.
50,Everyone is very friendly and helpful. My room was immaculate with my view and the comfortable bed. Would recommend this place to anyone coming to Vegas for whatever reasoning. I will be returning very soon!
50,Beautiful rooms great service the best restaurants room service quick and the best choices of slot machines but the 1st and more important great customer service.We keep going back to Ceasars Palace because is the best hotel in Las Vegas
50,Rooms are large comfortable beds very nice roomy bathrooms. Lots of nice restaurants to choose from. Good gaming selection and close to everything. Great customer service. What a great place to stay! Always a wonderful experience!
50,Clean didn‚Äôt smell like an ash tray friendly service nice rooms and lots of gambling options if you are into that. We saw Elton John when we were there and the seats were great!! Overall nice place and easy to walk everywhere.
50,My husband & I normally have a good experience at Caesar's when we visit. The rooms are nice & the restaurant's are good. The gaming is fun with alot of different slots to choose from. Our host is exceptional and takes care of all our needs to ensure we have a good time. I would recommend Caesar's to anyone.
10,The room was smallfridge was stuffed full of for sale stufftoilet paper was one-ply and hard.Long lines for Gold members because we had to wait until all other tierd members were waited on including at rewards desk and cage.People with chips were brought from the back of the line to the front.How humiliating for first time guest who had no idea it was like this!!!
50,I reckon Caesar's Palace is one of the best hotels on the strip.The shops at the Forum are amazing just watch the guys in the centre stalls they'll sell you anything.  If you are a non smoker definately ask for a non smoking room.
40,The room was spacious and the bathroom was beautiful. I was given a room with a view of the Lake Bellagio and hotels across the street. The transportation area for drop-offs and pick-ups were very convenient. The staff is friendly. The casino area was easy to navigate. I felt safe in the casino and other areas.
40,The facility is great. Well maintained supplied. Everyone looks and acts the part. The rooms are good however they offer a cheap $10 dollar opp out. The cleaning staff has to make more than that an hour.  The staff and management ;one meets in passing is courteous and helpful. Have excellent diner places if you can get to them. It in a good location that is in easy walking distance to other places.  The host are terrible and do not add any value to your trip. Compared to other casino's (no in Las V. there rate in the bottom 10%. I would not recommend attending unless you have established contacts previously.
40,Great stay at Caesars Palace. Couldn‚Äôt really fault anything but in particular the staff were very helpful. Location is central to everything in the strip.  Only disappointment was lack of smoke free area in the casino. Otherwise enjoyed our visit very much
50,Our second time here. Did they improve in comparison to 5 years? I say yes. We paid almost the same got an awesome room and the restaurants were 1st. I expected it to be more crowded after new years but the streets were not as crowded. Caesars was so friendly to welcome us with a message and some sweets. Also left the casino winning this time last time I was not that lucky.
40,Caesars is one of the best hotels although they have to figure out how to clear out the smoke at the casino. Gets really stuffy when the floor is packed. Rooms need to updated but they are still very good rooms
40,Octavius room was nice but basic. Amenities were fine and services good. We did enjoy the registration thru the Diamond area. Complimentary champagne and cookies!! Yummy. Very short wait. Check out was very simple and easy with the Total rewards App!!!
40,Went for NYE. Had a great time. Buffett was a little overpriced for the NYE meal and it showed. Very low attendance. Slots tight as always. Cocktail waitresses few and far between. But nice room and comfy bed.
50,i was in the newly remodeled palace tower. the grey decor is calming and tranquil. the room had the deepest tub i have found in vegas so far. the closet was ample and the navigating the thermostat was a breeze. while i did not use the prefilled in-house frig getting anotherr empty one was not a problem. the room came with a vanity table with lamp. mirror and make-up mirror. a great plus. there are also sitting benches at the foot of the beds making it easy to put on clothing and footwear.the beds are firm and comfortable. great room.
50,Caesar's Palace had a great NYE party for its guests. The theme was the Lost City and the setup was artistically done. The entertainment was great! Tiesto was the DJ. No better place to ring in the New Year!
50,I loved my stay in Vegas last week. Caesar's sports book was entertaining with Ocho Cinco doing a live broadcast. I like the poker room for $1 $2 cash games. The dealers are patient and professional. Rao's Italian Restaurant is fantastic. I was alone ate at the bar and had fun eating exceptional food.
10,We were not greeted by front desk attendant with much courtesy to begin. Then we ordered room service first night which was very expensive. In fact it costed nearly just as much as a steak and seafood dinner at gordon Ramsay‚Äôs steakhouse there in the casino. Hotel has resort fees which are pretty standard for high end casinos in Vegas honestly but then they also charge pretty steep daily valet charges for vehicle parking. Overall my experience felt a lot like ceasars palace was out to try to maximize extra charges and gouge guests already paying a high room rate to begin with
40,My first time in Vegas was an exciting time Caesar‚Äôs was gorgeous rooms and a much closer location to everything than the other towers at Caesars.  I love Caesars Palace but I was so disappointed with the service.
10,Reached the hotel in wee hour and had the worst check in experience ever. There were 3 lanes mainly for    1. Key replacement  2. Check-in  3. VIP    We waited at the check-in lane for 1 hour with no front office staff handling check in lane at all. There were 2 staffs handing key replacement and 2 staffs handling VIP no one bother to check on the check in lane. The guest behind us got frustrated and went to the key replacement lane and politely request them to help us check in as everyone were exhausted (long queue with at least 20 guest at the lane). However the staff responded ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only handling key replacement check in lane is over there *points to the check in lane* and my colleague is handling check in lane‚Äù. However there was no one standing beside her nor no one handle check in lane for 1 freaking hour. So the duty manager was called out and without finding the cause of the complaint the manager shouted at the guest loudly ‚ÄúYOU ARE PUBLIC NUISANCE‚Äù. Wow we are definitely not expecting this at all. The duty manager did not quickly resolve the issue instead he told the guest ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to ask my colleague here check in for you first because you are making a scene now‚Äù. And he went back to the back office. After 1 hour of waiting 1 staff from VIP lane finally willing to assist the check in lane.    The real nightmare starts when we reached our room located at forum building. The whole room is filled with dust dirty carpet sofa and bed linen. We also found a box of used condom box on the floor beside the bed. The tv remote control was badly damaged but they quickly send a new one over. As we are really tired after a long trip to the hotel we didn‚Äôt want to go down to the front office and request for another room just afraid that we need to wait for hours again.    The whole experience is pretty bad for such a high rating hotel. The security is pretty bad as well forum building lift doesn‚Äôt have any security put in place. Anyone can access the building to guest room anytime without needing any room key.
50,Loved staying at Caesars and will definitely be going back. Good room friendly staff and ideal location on the strip. A large variety of food options. Easy parking (free with Caesars rewards status).
50,Room is really nice  kinbig rear room and good service  need something make a call service be there quickly and it have good view to strip The room is kind big and nice  There is a large of the restaurant for u to choose and so so much place for shopping
40,Hotel has everything you can ask for. Whether you can with friends family or business. I actually had time to walk throughout the property and visit the shops gamble watch the games at the sports book and utilize the spa.
50,The hotel is gorgeous and on the strip. It offers plenty of dining choices and bars. The casino is huge with plenty of options. The location is fabulous. Check in was quick and the employees were great.
50,We love Caesars. We love to eat there because there are a variety of restaurants for every taste and budget. We love the rooms and frequently get upgraded. We go to the pool in the summer and the spa in the winter. We usually have good luck at the gaming here as well. Always a win/win situation at Caesars.
50,Nice room nothing super special but great pool with something always going on upscale shopping and great food with many options from steak to Asian vegan there is something for everyone and always a go to for entertaining family or friends
50,Beautiful remodeled suite restraunts still excellent entertainment options abound staff throughout the hotel and casino as good as anywhere in Vegas really enjoyed Caesars again gambling dining and hotel room options just still top line at Caesars hotel and casino vegas
50,Stayed in Augustus tower small suite with bellagio fountain view. Room was nice comfortable bed wonderful double vanity  jetted tub spa shower! Plenty of restaurants for every budget  we ate at Buffett it was exceptional 5star food priced mid to high range. Plenty of gaming and great access to entire strip!
50,Love staying at Caesars. The location and the buffet are the reasons why we stayed here. I would recommend anyone to stay at Caesars. Although our room was not as updated the warm and luxurious atmosphere made it worth it.
50,Stayed in the Palace Tower for 6 nites over the New Year's holiday...nice rooms and a much closer location to everything than the other towers at Caesars. Ate at Gordon Ramsey's Pub and Grill on New Year's Day...great food highly recommended and Sara was the best server you could hope for! Food service and staff was outstanding! All the New Year's eve action at midnight takes place right in front of Caesars so this was the perfect location to be at. Ideally located to get to all the major casinos nearby.
20,"I love Caesars Palace but I was so disappointed this year with the service. I have been going to Caesars for the last four years at New Years Holiday and this year it was disappointing from the rooms I ordered to the Spa. The front desk was a nightmare and they were overbooked. The front desk treats you like Monty Hall trying to make a deal..""just give me the rooms I booked"" The spa was fully booked so they brought in therapist with no to little experience. Very disappointing. The hotel has great location mall gaming and restaurants but you have to treat me like a person not a commodity. Maybe the movie made them a little too popular and they forgot we are paying customers:("
50,Caesars Palace has very well maintained rooms and property excellent staff and gets a 10 out of 10 rating. It has location to everything and is right in the heart of the strip. All of the staff goes out of their way to help you have a great stay.
40,This resort has it all to enjoy. From the gaming to shows to dining to shopping. Never a dull moment.  It was nice to have so much at one property and right in the middle of the strip to give you access to most of the other casinos on the strip.
50,We had a great time at Caesars Palace from the moment we arrived our receptionist Zandra was very friendly and helped us upgrade our room and housekeeping was also great and accommodating We will definitely stay at Caesars Palace again.
50,Room was clean roomy and bathroom was excellent. First night we came back to the room to find a nice cart with champagnecheesebread crackers and grapes waiting for us. Easy access from room down to the casino floor.
30,Don‚Äôt touch the mini bar if you have no intention of using. The mini bar is done on weight and you are instantly charged as soon as you pick up the item. Without any warning. This really ruined my stay as I was incredibly stressed out about paying for something I hadn‚Äôt even used. The hotel is in perfect location and our room was lovely. However I wouldn‚Äôt return.
50,During busy holiday season hotel pack with peoples i was be able to checking in within 15 min customer representative was fast friendly I have my room key within minutes. It make our trip was pleasure and thankyou Ceassars.
50,Our experience was great from the start! Our bellhop Tyge O. greeted us with a friendly smile and was eager to help us with all of our questions. He had lots of great suggestions for shows restaurants and shopping. He made sure our room was comfortable and walked us through to make sure we had everything we needed. The Caesar‚Äôs buffet was fantastic! We will definitely be making another trip.
40,Clean spacious. Nice place. Grounds were beautiful. Would recommend. Even won a jackpot. I would return. Next time would like to try the restaurants. Shopping was extremely nice. Overall good experience.
50,Great stay spacious and clean room. Only downside my room was next to the staff storage room & I heard a lot of slamming doors my first night. The bed & jacuzzi tub was very relaxing. I would definitely recommend this hotel & hopefully I wont be placed my the storage rooms.
50,Great service from Leallysa when I first arrived. Everything was all settled and arranged by her. Service was excellent. Wouldnt have this amazing stay if it wasn‚Äôt for her. I would totally recommend her for a promotion to a higher position. Her attitude and personality was 100%.
50,The room was clean and fit my expectations variety of food options to eat at Caesars Palace. And the New Years Eve party was awesome with Tiesto and Zara Larsson. All the employees were very friendly and helpful
30,Ceasars is beautiful as always. Guess service is lacking for what you pay. It seems in the middle but is a long walk just to get to the front door. My favorite property for convenience is flamingos or harahs not as nice though.
50,Another spectacular experience at Caesar's Palace. Just one of those hotels that delivers what you expect. Glitz Glamour and Glorious Gaming. We always try and stay in the August Tower although other areas are now being remodeled. It's one of the more crowded casinos but that comes with a lot of entertainment options. A special shout out to Clarae at Diamond Registration. She always makes the start of our visit warm and memorable. What exceptional customer service!!
50,Caesars employees are always welcoming helpful and will assist you in any way they can. It is always a pleasure to stay at one of their properties. I highly recommend anyone to visit one of the Caesar Reward properties and to join the rewards program.
50,I never write reviews but after this trip to Caesar‚Äôs Palace I felt compelled. We were treated like kings and queens.    The location of Caesar‚Äôs Palace can‚Äôt be beat if you want to get out and enjoy the Strip at night. Our hotel room in the Octavius tower was beautiful and the hotel staff was knowledgeable and helpful.    The dining was 5 star. We loved Nobu so much we decided to have dinner there twice. It really is a don‚Äôt miss in our book. For quick bites Pronto by Giada is great. We were so tired from a very early morning flight that we ordered room service breakfast when we arrived and it was delicious. We had lunch at Gordon Ramsay‚Äôs Pub and we will definitely be back on our next trip!    I highly recommend Caesar‚Äôs to anyone that wants to play dine shop and relax on their trip to Las Vegas. When we think Vegas we automatically think Caesar‚Äôs! We are already planning our next visit.
50,good hotel a lot of shops and restaurants very friendly environment.  very comfortable and large rooms. good location on the strip of Las Vegas center of all he hotels.  check out Ramsey Gordon place good food.
50,We stayed at the Palace tower an the room was beautiful !! The casino was fun and shops fantastic!!! Caesars is located in the middle of the strip so it‚Äôs a close walk to everything! The casino and property offer so much.. probably no need to leave!!!
50,Great rooms beyond competitors with few exceptions. Expensive dining options. Multiple table options with multiple minimum requirements. Great number of slot and video options. Great atmosphere and guest experiences.
50,My wife and I were visiting Caesars for a Journey concert. We really enjoy the venue because its more intimate than most. We also enjoy the Forum shops and the restaurants located in the casino and in the shops.
40,Our stay was great and we were treated well. Received an upgraded room at check in. Our Diamond Status got us line passes at the buffet which was superb. The casino was not smoky. The only improvement that we recommend is more comfortable mattresses in the rooms. Would highly recommend Caesars to others.
50,Stayed in the Augustus tower with a nice view of Paris hotel Eiffel Tower and Bellagio fountain shows. Loved the Gordon Ramsey Pub and Grill food. Had fun playing blackjack up and down the strip. And the store staff at the Forum Shops were both friendly and helpful.
50,Incredible experience been to vegas many times and this was one of my favorites. Call me crazy but I already booked another trip and now even a week has passed by. I would highly recommend more people to experience it.
40,Our large room was located in the Palace tower our only complaint was the long walk to our room. We found all of the staff to be friendly and helpful. We worked with the bell man Johnny to recover our suitcase from the airlines. We upgraded our room with help from the front desk staff. We also enjoyed the casino just wish their table limits weren't so high.
50,The Play at Caesars was the most enjoyable along with the staff and pit bosses. They were there to make sure we had the best time we could. Win Or lose the experience was the best we could have hoped for we are already planing another trip to Caesars.
50,Nice size comfortable room with a Las Vegas strip view where we enjoyed the New Year‚Äôs Eve fireworks. It was very convenient to see Journey in concert at the hotel during our trip. There were many great dining options within the hotel too!
50,Spa was great a bit crowded at first but it was NYE weekend so expected. Took excellent care of my wife and I great restaurants and access to other Caesar rewards properties. Everyone was polite gave great advice and directions. Didn‚Äôt get to visit the pool this trip because of the weather but in the summer it is a great place to hang out.
50,Our experience was outstanding. Great location great roomgreat facilities and great restaurants. Our host was totally accommodating and helpful. We highly recommend this venue. Location is excellent with great access to other Caesar's properties.
50,Having never been to Vegas we weren't sure what to expect but the accommodations at Caesars were fantastic! We enjoyed the gaming tables and our dealers really made sure we were enjoying ourselves. There was a mistake made by one of our dealers and the pit boss immediately rectified the situation. the only downside to our entire trip was the constant smoking. After being at the tables and in the Sports Beting for several hours we all smelled like cigarettes. Maybe there was a non-smoking area but we never found it
50,Stayed at Westgate Flamingo bay. Played slots and ate at steak house. Steak was great but costly. Physical facilities great easy to find and to learn where to go. Slots was a little tight and I did it win. Overall a good experience
30,Room was nice food quality was average at best. Weather was awsome. Most of the restaurant waitstaff were more intrested in discussing current events with other staff members than providing service. Staff was not helpful.
30,Hi   We recently checked in at Caesar‚Äôs Paalce and had a pretty unusual situation happen . We arrived on January 1st 2020 around 10:30  when we checked in we were told the the hotel was pretty full and that we would be getting very basic rooms . It was fine because the gentleman told us that we could easily get an upgrade if we come in the morning. Up to now all was fine  once we arrived in the room 6018 we noticed that the bathroom was used and not flushed .... fine we flushed it and just kept going . We went about our night and went to the casino to play. At around 1 am we went up to sleep and I was undoing the bed I noticed some hairs in the bed. I didn‚Äôt think that was normal so I called front desk and told them that the room looks like it had been used because the bathroom was dirty and the bedsheets were used . They told me no problem we will send someone up. At around 1:30 I had to call back again because nobody came. The lady at reception told me she would have someone sent over ASAP. The bedsheets were changed and we went to bed and did not make a fuss of the situation. The next morning we went to reception and spoke to Joe the manager on duty and explained to him the situation. He apologized and told us that he could not do anything but we would have to speak to Duncan for the room upgrade. What was fixed was that we would upgrade both our rooms for a fee of 30$ a room per night but there was only one room available. He took our numbers and told us he would call us . So basically we were stranded without a room and had to hang out in the streets. That happened around 9am when my husband went to check if there was any news and give back the keys to the old rooms  Duncan proc√©d√©s to tell him that it‚Äôs not guaranteed that the room will be assigned to us because usually the rooms are given at 3... but we had checked in the room the night before and we were stuck waiting outside. Honestly the experience was extremely disappointing and to top it off we had brought our friends with us to Ceasars place because it‚Äôs our favorite place and it. Did not impress them at all . Finally at around 2:30 when we received no call we passed by again waited at the counter again and we spoke to Macy who arranged a room for us. Finally it all worked out  but usually an experience like that should be addressed by the floor manager and solved by that manager. It is utterly unacceptable that guests arrive in a room in a reputable Hotel and have a dirty used bathroom and used bedsheets .  I then decided to send a email to a higher up manager . He answered promptly and urged me to reach out to him before leaving the hotel I spoke to him the day before we left and he offered to credit us the first night upgrade (30$) for both our rooms. I spent over 2 hours (total)waiting at front desk  spent 1 whole day on 5 days without a room . And that‚Äôs what was offered so I refused the credit and said no thank you. He then replied by giving us 30*2 nights per room . Fine whatever to compensate for us having a used room and dirty bed sheets . Then out vacation went by we had a great timeon the last day  our flight was at 11:35 pm and check out was at 11am so we added late checkout for both our rooms to be able to sleep in . Our checkout was delayed at 13:00 for the cost of 30$ per room . The only thing was that as of 11 until 13:00 we had over 4 people knock on our door and walk in even though the privacy light was on. They literally asked us to leave  when we explained to them that we had late checkout . It seems like the employees they hire are either inexperienced or there is a lack of communication in the hotel . Honestly I was very very disappointed and will not come back to Ceasars‚Äôs palace in the future
40,$20.00 per day to park $6.75 for a liter of soda in gift shop  $28.00 for a cheeseburger and $9.75 for a draft beer is highway robbery.The place is beautiful but so over priced it was not enjoyable...
30,The hotel looks really nice but the bathroom & shower were leaking and flooding our entire bathroom so we have to use tons of towels to absorb the water the whole time we were there for 5 days. They sent maintenance to fix it but were not able to fix the problem.
50,Amazing room with wonderful views     I‚Äôm very impressed with quality of decor and the selection of shops and restaurants. Shop till you drop here with the variety of shops from basic to couture fashion it‚Äôs all here...    I‚Äôm very satisfied with my stay can‚Äôt wait to return.. visit Caesars you won‚Äôt be disappointed..
50,Customer service is always top notch. I always enjoy my stays at Caesars. Rooms have been updated. Never a long wait for a cocktail at the tables. Looking forward to the next visit. Now if I could only win more often...
50,We stayed at Caesars for New Years eve week 2020. The room was fabulous! The staff were helpful and friendly and the casino is great! This was our first time to Vegas. Caesars is centrally located and all of the shopping and restaurants are at your doorstep. All of the food served at Caesars restaurants was splendid. We would definitely stay again.
50,Last minute trip w/o the kids I wish we could have stayed longer!! We had a great view of the Bellagio water fountains. Slept so good we almost missed our flight. I cant complain about anything I guess it would have been nice if you at least got complimentary coffee for the coffee maker but it was $14 for the kit. Other than that loved everything about the place!!!
40,We stayed Octavius Tower 5nights.  Usually we stayed Augustus Tower in 10yrs.  The Rooms nice easy to access restaurants casino.  Butthere is no pressure in the shower.  This is very important for long stay.
50,I came to Caesars Palace for the Sportsbook and had a good experience. They have big TV's and fast service when placing bets. I would recommend this Sportsbook to anyone gambling on The Strip. The location is in the central part of the Strip for easy access. Caesar's owns most of the hotels within the area so accomodations are easy. Their rewards program also provides points and status when gambling at their properties.
50,My husband and I had a wonderful time! Vegas is our second home. Thank you Caesars Properties for the opportunity to celebrate New Year's Eve in Vegas! Well definitely be back during the summer with family and friends!
50,It was so great to stay in Caesars for the holidays. We went to attend the NYE dinner party and it was so amazing!!! We watched Miss Zara Larsson and DJ Ti√´sto. Restaurants are all over no need to get out. But as a Slot Machine player I will rate Caesars 8 (1-10). I recommend this hotel 100%. Don‚Äôt forget Caesars has the best SPA
50,Great trip had a lot of fun but I lost some money on the tables. Overall property is very clean and nice. Staff is kind and caring. Dealers are also very nice. Pitt bosses should try to be a bit more courteous as well.
30,Property too large rooms were nice. Service was below average assuming due to holiday or sale of property. Were there 5 nights one of the nights they did not clean room. Reward lines only had three people taking care of long lines.
30,Didn't get room i reseved. The VIP Personal Service person didn't contact us till the day before we left.    Was hard finding our room. The room was clean and nice.Roll way was comfortable. The buffet was very good. New Years Eve was a great party. Fireworks were beautiful. Enjoyed it very much.
50,Caesars Palace is wonderful everyone was so helpful the room was very spacious and we had a great view of the strip. We were there for New Years Eve and got to experience the fireworks we were right beside the launch site and it was great.
50,The staff was very accommodating and pleasant. The hotel was in the heart of Caesars Palace and very convenient to everything we wanted to do. The room was nice and the bed very comfortable. We will stay here again.
50,Stayed at the Julius Tower 9th floor extremely clean house keeping bell desk etc were prompt and always curtious.  I will definitely recommend Ceasar Palace to friends and Family.  Thank you Ceasar Staff for a wonderful experience!
50,My husband and I visited Las Vegas the week leading up to Thanksgiving. We were there for a total of 5 nights and stayed in a king room in the Augustus Tower. We had an exceptional experience from checking in at the Diamond member room to using our resort credits and gambling on their extensive casino floor. We will be back!
50,Love the Augustus Tower convenience and modern finishes. Fast elevators. Never a long wait. Very lovely atmosphere. Best piece of meat I ever had at Old Homestead Steakhouse. Food court is a little pricey but convenient with a lot of variety.
50,The rooms are spacious elegant. The room service is amazing concierge office can HELP with anything you Need. Restaurants are the Top of stars ratings  personnel are always ready to help with anything you want
50,Rooms are great and up to date bed was the best sleep I had in awhile staff was very friendly and lots of good shopping and slots. Very good eating options as well at the property. We were there during New Years Eve and they had enough staff to handle the crowds and they were able to keep their establishment clean. My only negative is I wished that the casino was no smoking the smoke was unbearable at time. And for some reason it seemed like everyone had a dog with them maybe it was just the time of year.
50,Caesars still holds the feeling of classic Vegas but all the new Vegas perks. We enjoyed our stay and can't wait to go back. Dinner at Mesa was to good to be describe and I think I put on 10 pounds :)
50,Caesar's is the best place to go for vacation but on New Year's Eve it becomes even more special I cannot think of a better hotel to stay in Vegas. The rooms are great the food is awesome and the proximity to the Forum Shops makes Caesar's a top destination
40,Stayed here for 7 nights - fantstic location. The hotel is just out of this world... the beds were so comfy - upgrades avalible if you ask nicely. Food choice was amazing and spa area was everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel - If its your first time to Vegas then come here as its the most iconic and make the memory special - Hells Kitchen as well !!!
50,this is a very very nice hotel I love staying there as does my wife. The casino is very well laid out and easy to find your way around friendly casino workers very fun place.thats about all there is to say iyws a fun fun time
50,My time at Caesars was extremely pleasant. Staff was extremely resourceful. I lost my phone on 2 separate occasions- and each time staff located it. The property is always well maintained. Caesars is the ultimate one-stop entertainment spot in Vegas.
50,This was a fantastic visit. The resort shows atmosphere and people were all extraordinary.. Our host Lesia Dupree from Caesar's Palace anticipated our every need and enhanced our stay. We went to Cirque du Soleil Mystere and were amazed. The architecture and adornments of the hotel were amazing. The sights to be seen were wonderful. There was a fantastic variety of slot machines..
50,we got a nice room with a good view of the las vegas strip. The hotel was clean even though it was very very busy as expected this time of the year.good service no problems had a great Happy new years eve 2020. we visited all the way from hawaii.
20,No hot water and the plumbing needs to be fixed. Make sure the hot water works. I asked for a technician to come and fix it but it took too long. Also the room next door had their drain back up and it overflowed into the hallway. It was gross. My boyfriend got food poisoning at the Americano restaurant. It was not a good first time in Vegas!
50,I have written full length reviews of this place before. As usual it‚Äôs been a terrific experience from check-in to check-out. Meka in the Diamond check in was fabulous. She got me checked in fast made sure I had a fantastic room and made some great dining and entertainment recommendations. The room was impeccably clean and had a gorgeous view of the Bellagio fountains. I‚Äôm proud to call Caesars my home away from home.
40,Overall Excellent!  Most of the rooms & furnitures are kind of old and but well cleaned and maintained.  All properties are located conveniently.  All affiliated properties and their gaming chips should be exchangeable and casino cage/cashiers should take & be a led cashed.
50,I stayed in the Augustus tower on the 32nd floor with the strip and Bellagio fountain view.    The room was large attractive had a seating area dining table and desk. The windows were floor to ceiling and offered exceptional views of the strip and Bellagio fountains. The black our curtains did an excellent job. There was a Krupps coffee maker and fully stocked quiet refrigerator - no personal refrigerator!! The room was very comfortable and enjoyed.    The king bed and pillows were very good and plush ‚Äî two pillow density options!!. The room was very quiet during my four night stay. House keeping did an excellent job each day!    The room had warm lighting options on dimmers. The safe worked and there was an iron and ironing board in the closet. There were nice full length mirrors.    There was a spacious shower and separate jacuzzi tub for two. The toilet was separated in its own closet.    The staff at the check in were exceptional!!!! I sadly forgot the name of the person who checked me in - 5+ stars.    The casino was lively and enjoyed. They offer some different dining options. There is also a relatively good night club- Omnia.    I slept well and deeply. I loved the view. It always felt good coming back to the room. I had an excellent stay!!    Caesars Palace was built over many decades and offers different towers to stay in. I suggest you do a little research before booking. I can definitely recommend mine!!
20,How is this room in the palace tower supposed to be their most newly renovated? Room was nicely decorated but no modern enhancements. No USB ports for charging. No music options. Bedding was horrible. Sheets were like paper pillows flat. A couple of lights wouldn't work. This was literally their nicest room until you jump up to a suite.    Very disappointed. Go Rooms at Flamingo are nicer for half the price.
50,As always our trip was fabulous! The staff is wonderful from management to housekeeping! Our host Steve is amazing! We‚Äôve celebrated New Years at Caesayma y times and We will definitely be back more this year!
50,Rooms are very clean with no foul odors or beat up furniture. Employees were very professional and nice greeting you with smiles all the time.. Would stay there again. Food was excellent and fresh !! Thanks for honoring veterans as well.
50,Staying in the 35th floor of the Augustus Tower was beautiful. The room  Overlooked the fountains and the strip. The room was beautifully decorated and security was strong with having to show room key to gain access to the elevators which kept guests only in the area. Super nice!
50,Big spacious and beautiful hotel with lots of top culinary restaurants as well as gaming! You can enjoy many stores for shopping enjoyment excellent fast food to world famous buffet to award winning top culinary restaurants to famous television chefs' restaurants like Gordan Ramsay and others.
50,I've enjoyed staying here for years. It's my hotel of choice when visiting Las Vegas. Beds and pillows are very comfortable. Rooms are nice and updated. The casino staff is very friendly and the cocktail waitresses offer prompt service.
50,Our room was spectacular in the palace tower! We love this hotel as it is right on the strip and centrally located. Staff are very kind helpful and friendly. This was the fourth stay for me at Caesars and I can‚Äôt stay anywhere else. Restaurant choices are plentiful! Highly recommend!
10,Did a last minute single night stay on our trip through western USA and I will never stay at a Caesars resort again. Our room was miles away from anywhere valet parking was full so the self park was also a long hike away. That stuff minimal for a a Saturday night in Vegas. But hoping to get a hot shower after driving all day wasn‚Äôt ok. It was impossible to get any type of warm at all - so cold shower it was. We had heard from other guests if you turn all the sink bath and shower taps on hot at the same time eventually you will get hot. Tried this - didn‚Äôt happen. Called front desk and were to send engineer- no one showed up. Packed our things as we had to get on the road and left. Without anything but cold water. Having hot water is a REQUIREMENT for any hotel stay.  I asked for at least a minimum of 50%refund and was told the resort fee would be refunded. Not acceptable. Waiting for management (24-48 hour response time apparently) to call  And will see what they say. Definitely should have stayed at Mirage Mandalay Aria or my other usual hotels as Caesars completely disappointed me. Never again.
50,If you have a smartphone the self check in and out procedures is simple and amazing. No lines! Easy to understand instructions. Plus this is just a beautiful place. Rooms great. Good fantastic. Centrally located on the strip so you can walk everywhere. We‚Äôve stayed other places here but this is by far the best!
50,This hotel is amazing the rooms are well decorated and clean.  We enjoyed the live music in the casino and loved the drinks.  We also recommend the buffet Bacchanal the price is worthy.  And we didn't have to go somewhere else to shop because it has everything.
10,"I stayed here for New Years. Had a great time...until my Louis Vuitton bag was stolen from my hotel room by housekeeping.    Let me preface:    1) I didn't request housekeeping while I was there...in fact the reservation specifically had notes for no housekeeping. We even kept the sign on the door for extra precaution.  2) We didn't lose any room keys...still had the original 4 room keys and the lock interrogation showed a non faulty/defective lock.  3) No one should have been in our room. Our room was never cleaned and we never received fresh towels (which was requested 3 TIMES).    I filed a report and asked for a case number...the security guy said he would generate one. I never got it and still don't have it.  Went through the standard procedure - lock interrogation surveillance video review. They took down my info and I didn't hear back. I finally had to go to the Seven Stars front desk and inquire.  The manager there said the investigations was closed because the video showed no evidence that appeared suspicious and they didn't see any evidence of ANYONE ENTERING THE ROOM. NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON ASIDE FROM THE PEOPLE I STAYED WITH. Complete BS here's why...(I'm not sure why this information wasn't relayed back to me immediately and I shouldn't have to inquire about it if they said they'd reach out to me...    Here is my evidence:    See attached picture and excuse the mess. Neither of those items circled in the picture were requested by any member of my party that stayed with. So clearly someone entered my room and left those there AND the only people who would have those two items are housekeeping. So they came into the room and left those two items. Didn't clean the room or anything. Keep in mind the security agent I filed the report with took a picture of the items too...BECAUSE IT'S SUSPICIOUS yet they had the audacity to tell me they don't have any evidence of someone coming in the room.    I showed the manager the picture after she said the investigation is closed and she even thought it was suspicious and left us for a second and came back. Then she said she would get back to us.    After a couple hours she called me back and said she wasn't sure if there was miscommunication but the key-in log indicated housekeeping did enter (ummm yeah??? I have evidence????)    ANOTHER FISHY EVENT THAT HAPPENED: Along with that a few hours before I came back to my room to find it missing house keeping saw us walking to the elevator to leave she asked us ""what room are you guys staying in?"" Not thinking much about it I answered her. She smiled and said ""oh that's not my room and walked off. Coincidentally after that my bag went missing.    So fast forward a couple days they are giving me a hard time every time I call in.    Depending on how they handle this situation I will be a patron at another hotel."
20,I was really annoyed that they don‚Äôt have complementary coffee that you can use with in room coffee maker. They charged $14 for the in room K-cups. I have never come across that before. Resort fee was $44/night and shots were super tight and I never won anything over $30 /spin despite spending over $2000. No pool access during winter. Food court was disappointing. I‚Äôll never stay at this resort again.
50,Centrally located on the strip walking distance to everything and the best restaurants in Vegas. The rooms are beautiful - the best bathrooms and beds! If you get into Augustus or Octavius then expect a larger room and a jetted tub! You have to try Mesa Grill Carmines (The Forum Shops) and the amazing Bacchanal Buffet. This is the only place we stay in Vegas what more could you ask for or want?
40,It‚Äôs a nice casino but getting a bit dated with its low ceilings and the gaming area is spread over a large semicircle. They have a reasonable restaurant selection. Was not impressed with Rao‚Äôs but did like Mr Chows. The food at Mr. Chows was great as was the service. The atmosphere is relaxing.
40,With Jan 2 anniversary date the rates at Caesars were so reasonable and of course the room was large and nice. Love the location of Caesars on the Strip. The casino was just a terrible gambling experience with just outrageous table minimums and terrible rules. So we had to go out of the hotel to enjoy playing any games which was inconvenient but luckily lots of options close by. The Fitness Center at Caesars is also fabulous for gym enthusiasts!
50,We had a wonderful time at Caesars Palace. We were in room 2782 and 2780. The rooms were spacious and modern and very comfortable. Other than those rock hard sofas. I do think that you could supply coffee for the rooms though!
10,This is our third time in Vegas. We tried the Venetian and Bellagio before and wanted to give a try to Caesar palace. The hotel is nice but the room that we got and the service are not good. We first were given a room that had a view on a parking even though the room was described to be a deluxe room with premium view on Expedia. I had to go complain at the front desk to be given the only option that they had (a pool view). After we got into the room I found one dirty towel that has some yellow stain. This is not acceptable from such a hotel. On the second day the room service cleaned the room and forgot to provide us with towels!! So basically no shower or anything for our last day.  Not coming here for sure.
50,Room was perfect large variety of restaurants. Personnel very friendly and attentive  Only thing to regret is that everybody can smoke in the building and every common spaces and casino  Except that i will recommand and should surely go another time.
50,Getting the most of your traveling and resort experience Caesars palace is everything you will ever need in a casino resort experience. Our next visit we may not even have to leave the palace. The experience take you thought the now and to the past and back again. There were many dinning experiences that we could not even experience. To many to choose from. And last your experience will be highlighted by the Bacchanal dinning experience sensation. Over 500 items to choose from with approximately 400 feet of dinner serving stations. The price is comparable to the food quality. Become part of the empire.book your stay now!!!
50,This is one of the best hotels in Las Vegas. This is very big that if someone like quiet place this hotel is not for them. The best tower is Augustus. The newest is an Octavius.  Both are very good. The buffet is great!
40,Caesars has always been a great destination. Maybe it was the holidays but it wasn‚Äôt as upbeat and experiences I normally have there. There really were no Christmas decorations to speak up as compared to some of the other larger properties.
50,Dealers here are friendly and helping. They create positive environment. I'm sure we will have fun out here. Best part is drinks comes on time and the quality is good unlike others who serve only ice instead of drink. Tip them for the best service have fun and come out with full pockets.
50,We travel on to Las Vegas on Dec. 26 2019 the day after Christmas. We were traveling from California. Cajon pass and Mountain pass were closed and 15 freeway from Bakers  to Primm were closed due to heavy  rain and ends up snowing and icy road. We got stocked in the freeway. But was able to re route using 40 and US 95 as alternative road. We traveled total of 16 hours instead of 3 1/2 hours. When we get to the hotel the staff were very pleasant and very accommodating we got our room right away and we were able to rest after long hours of horrible road trip we experienced.
50,Just like always caesar‚Äôs Palace is so nice to stay. We went to the Coliseum for a concert in the sound there is incredibly good ! Are room was nice for one older towers. They have the best combination of restaurants to choose from Low price to medium to high price food . The shopping at the forum is nice from medium price to high end shopping something for everyone to shop. And watching the fireworks on New Year‚Äôs Eve was so much fun.
50,Always enjoy my time at this property. Everyone is friendly and helpful. Played table and slots. The location is a cut above other casinos on the vegas strip. Gordon Ramsey Pub is an excellent place to eat and drink.
50,Excellent hotel with vast shopping and food choices. There were lots of people in the registration area due to travel events but the Caesar's Hotel team managed to whip through the huge number of people with all hands on deck.
50,Nice and clean room great location  Plenty of options to eat anytime of the day.  Friendly employees always ready to help you out. We have been going for New Years for the last few years and have not been disappointed great place to welcome a new year!
40,A nice place to stay. The room was huge and clean. There are lots of restaurants to choose and most of them are 5 star restaurants. It‚Äôs in the strip so it is really close to everything. We would love to go back here again
50,We love Caesars Palace Resort. They have beautiful and comfortable rooms & suits with full amenities inside.I love the Verities and best quality Restaurants. The Casino is full of Slot machines and Tables with friendly employees and managers. Their Swimming pool at Caesars is amazing and beautiful.
50,Great food and Amenities. The room was very clean and bathroom with a nice bath tub and separate toilet room and great food options and casino games at the Hotel. My family and I enjoyed our stay over the Christmas break.
40,My first time in Vegas was an exciting time Caesar‚Äôs was great rooms are nice and clean staff is wonderful except for some older dealers that we grumpy a lot of the time stay clear of those dealers but my overall experience was wonderful I‚Äôll be back for sure!!!!
50,All the common areas such as bathrooms and gambling areas were very clean and well maintained. The dealers were all friendly and seemed happy to be working. The pit bosses were also helpful and fast with my requests
50,the Augustus tower is nice and clean close to the valet and taxi area. Starbucks was a plus just right down the elevator. Checking in was a hassle free process I love the kiosks. The shops at The Forum was really nice.
40,Caesars Palace is very large and beautiful. The mall located there is amazing! We love the atmosphere the drinks and the vibe at Caesars Palace! The dealers can be a little crusty but that is to be expected.  Thank you
50,This was a excellent visit and first class stay at the Palace.  We stayed in the Octavius Tower Premium Room. Very nice property with lot of space. Prompt and excellent service to our request. We had a view of the pool area which is simply beautiful. Beds very comfortable and decorated nicely. A great place to stay and visit.
40,Enjoyed all of the properties under management. Enjoyed the Ferris wheel. We found a terrific little spot to eat that is never busy and very convenient to get a table at. And had a few slot machines that we enjoyed.
30,It‚Äôs kinda hard to get around if you don‚Äôt the way. But it‚Äôs a nice place bathtub was great and room was clean and kept well. Hallway sometimes smelt bad but not intolerable. Slot machine don‚Äôt pay off since you are in strip.
40,Wife and I had a wonderful time at Caesars. Staff is excellent and restaurant selection was fantastic. Also they have the best Sports Book on the strip as well as great slot selection. Lastly the central location of where Caesars is on the strip allows you easy access to other propertys
50,We had a great weekend and Casino is centrally located. Caesars Palace is linked to several casinos and we were able to hop between all of them. We definitely plan on returning soon. We didn't see any shows this time around but definitely plan on it next time.
50,Nothing to complain. Room is spacious clean. Hotel workers are friendly. Location is great. Maybe one concern about the room service: no price showing on the menu so we didn‚Äôt order any room service.
50,1st class sevice and teriffic property from food choices to shopping experience at the Fourum Shops.  Been to Las Vegas and Caesars Palace many times and have always had excellent experiences and always look forward to returning.
40,I stayed at the Bellagio and walked over to Ceasars very nice and laid out and lots of slot machines and table games. I played the craps tables and slot machines. I didn't not go anywhere else through the casino but that area was very nice.
50,I was at Caesar Palace and the hotel is clean and very relax. I hope to come back the next time on my coming up trip to Vegas. This is my first time staying here and glad that I choose Caesar Palace. It very nice and lots of people staying here.
50,Our family was in Las Vegas at Ceasar's Palace for my daughter's wedding. Craigthe front desk customer service professionalwas excellent. His knowledge of the hotel their services and the local area was exceptional. Friendlywell dressedand very professional. He had answers and solutions for everything. Craig is a testament to the reputation that Ceasar's Palace has built. I don't usually do reviews but he made us feel like family.
50,We always stay at Caesars Palace during our Las Vegas trips -- a premium room in the Augustus Tower with a view of the Ballagio fountains -- it's not a suite but feels like one because it's large and lovely. Service is great. We are comped for everything -- otherwise Casears is expensive. Rao's at Caesars is our favorite Las Vegas restaurant and brunch at Caesars Bacchanal Buffet is outrageous (in a good way!). The one downside: No Caesars property in Las Vegas has a good blackjack game.
40,I had a great experiance at Caesars Palace. It was my first time staying their. the room was bright and clean. The room attendants were very helpful and polite. Made my stay very enjoyable would recommend it to all.
50,If you are looking for a great place for New Years Caesars is the place to go. They have all types of amenities for the family and the professional staff are always assisting when needed. Access from the hotel to the strip is perfect right in the middle of it all!
50,We usually stay at Caesar‚Äôs properties when in Vegas. Great rooms and customer service. Never disappoint. Highly recommend especially Caesar‚Äôs palace. Centrally located on the strip. Easy access to the shops restaurants etc.
50,The room was gorgeous and the beds are super comfortable! I slept like a baby. I highly recommend eating at Hell‚Äôs Kitchen or a drink and appetizer at aVanderpump Garden. I went to both and loved each one equally.
50,I call Vegas my second home Caesars Palace continues to renew it's dedication to their customers excitement and pleasures. They have elite professionalism and caring service. Caesars Palace continues to be my first and only choice to stay!
50,Came to caesars palace in Christmas week and had wonderful experience. Location was great and customer service was friendly and quick. I would definitely come back to caesars palace for my future vegas trip.
50,We had a great stay. We stayed in the most recently renovated Palace tower in a Studio King room. The room was very nice. Clean super comfortable bed 2 bathrooms (his and hers). I will definitely stay again.
50,Great room and food the staff was extremely nice and courtesy. You have everything in the hotel that you need. The hotel is also adjacent to the shopping area where all of your high end stores are. This hotel is very inviting and there is always something going on.
50,CP has endless food options a large casino and other underrated areas that you can spend without having to gamble. Gambling is about the same at any casino but it's what we do when we are not at the tables that separates the competition. CP has it all.
40,Room is great and big which has view to the fountain of Bellagio. Caesar reward program is the best value. Food court has many vary of food. Employee are very helpful. Place is pretty clean Highly recommended.
50,I loved my time at Caesars. Table limits were much higher then I‚Äôm accustomed to but great experience. Bacchanal buffet was fantastic great food options and venues. Hotel room acopmdarions at palace was new and nice. Overall a great experience
50,Where do I begin.... Our room was so awesome beyond comfortable bed large room with the most awesome view clean and fresh. Hotel staff were helpful friendly accommodating went out of their way to ensure our comfort. The hotel is beyond compare beautiful and elegant.
50,Caesars Palace never fails to live up to its reputation. Big beautiful also very crowded and very expensive. Won't find $5 tables or casino comp meals here. Stayed there Christmas Eve & Day 2019. Surprisingly lots and lots of people with children everywhere on the strip. No draw for children's entertainment we saw. But not everyone celebrates Christmas as a religious holiday.
30,When I arrived Caesars Palace hotel I couldn't find a parking spaces easily.  It better to be install at parking structure a new easy find parking system.  Also buffet restaurant line up system was very poor and messy.
50,The NYE party was spectacular! I was expecting dinner and a band but it was so much more. My wife and I had a great time. Our host greeted us and made sure we were having a great time. The band was incredible great dance music!
50,Our diamond check in was fantastic! Eric checked us in and was super friendly and extremely helpful and even walked all the way to the elevators to tell us about something that he thought he had forgotten. Best check in ever!
10,Wife and I were verbally abused and threatened in parking garage after we were mistaken for another Lyft rider! Security did nothing to listen to us and literally made my wife and I walk off property in the middle of the street as she fell over and cut knees as she caught her heal in crack. Person in charge was Oliveres (last name). Not sure why I can‚Äôt get a hold of anyone there to hold this guy accountable. Shame on them. With physical threats is amazing this is allowed. Won‚Äôt go back and will deter any plans with friends and family in future. Shame on Caesars Palace for allowing this. Oliveres shouldn‚Äôt have a job. Hopefully police does something.
50,My kids and I love staying at Caesars Palace. The rooms are big beautiful and clean. We are always so comfortable when we stay there. The staff is so nice and accommodating. The food is great. We have ventured out of the hotel to see more of Vegas but there really isn't any need - Caesars Palace has so much to offer that we never want to leave. And so many ways to get a good price!
40,I love coming back twice a year  if i can i enjoy any caesar property  stuff and cleanliness .. Relaxing  shows live band slots machine  black jack . mostly.mostly i lost but still enjoyment .. was there dec 19 2019 my gf 50th bday
40,Having been to Vegas several times over the years I have tried to make it a point to stay at as many hotels as possible before choosing one that I would continuously visit. Case in point was my recent stay at Caesar's Palace. Was initially very excited at finally staying here as I have always wanted to but price was usually the main obstacle. Being December they had a free night promotion which I jumped at. The check in was quick and painless and they even upgraded us to the Ocatvius Tower which had been at least partially renovated (they really need to complete the reno as many of the wood furnishings and fixtures are aged and worn). Room was spacious and beds are very comfortable. Two things shocked me given what these rooms go for on an average day. The lousy wifi and the LCD TV (its 2020 now for crying out loud get an LED TV and good wifi that doesn't continuously boot you off). Also given the exorbitant resort fee of almost $50US per day I would have expected them to allow more than 2 devices at a time on the wifi (more than that was $14.99 per device which is ludicrous). Aside from those minor details (some people more than others would consider these things more than minor) the stay was great restaurants superb and casino (especially the sports book which is one of the best) are top notch. However unless I receive a free stay offer from the Caesars points card I won't be back to stay only to use the sports book. Far too many other options at their price point (Palazzo Venetian Wynn etc.) which are as good if not better.
50,Stayed here before so knew what to expect and caesars certainly didn‚Äôt disappoint.a great location right in the middle of the strip.check in was very quick and easy we even got a room upgrade as we were there to celebrate a birthday. The rooms were clean and very spacious we had two queen beds which were very large.we had spoke to the hotel with some requests beforehand and they made sure that they catered for our needs.the hotel has lots of bars/restaurants catering for most tastes from snack food right up to fine dining.we ate at Gordon Ramsey‚Äôs pub and grill which was ok.the food court is a good place for a quick snack during the day.There is a really good shopping mall on the grounds with some good shops.we had trouble finding some reasonably priced gaming tables so tended to go elsewhere to play which is a shame.overall a great hotel with loads to do and we will definitely stay here again on our next visit.get a Caesars reward card to earn points on slots shopping and dining.pre Christmas is a good time to go as it‚Äôs quieter and not so hot.
50,Our room was wonderful it had 2 bathrooms! And Jay in the Diamond/Seven Stars check-in was great so friendly! Had a wonderful time. Really appreciated the addition of the security near elevators checking for hotel guests.
50,Went dinner in area and decided to spend some time at caesars great location and drove from where I live in Henderson to the Strip fun time  Normally I gamble locally but when I go to strip I gamble at caesars
50,Michelle  Checked us in at the diamond and seven stars lounge was exceptional on every detail  Friendly and professional service at the highest level hope her supervisor notes and promote her enjoyed our stay  Thanks Carroll
50,we stayed for 10 nights in the Augustus Tower in a Octavius Suite which had seperate lounge dining room and separate bathroom. Whilst this was great the only negatives was housekeeping very slack had to ring several times to get service and then they would still not do as requested. The first day we arrived we had to wait until midnight to get shower cleaned as their were long black hairs stuck on tiles I told the cleaner in the hall and she said she would fix but when we got back to room still not done so we rang housekeeping and asked for shower to be cleaned and extra towels the towels came but they said another person would come do cleaning got back to room later that evening and nothing done so had to complain again and wait til after midnight for cleaner who was really lovely and cleaned shower and said glass was not up to standard too and cleaned that. Other times we had to ring and ask for room to be cleaned and wait hours for it to happen. This was downside i guess of being there over christmas period with less staff perhaps
40,The service at Caesars was great and more specifically the service provided by Michelle A at checkin. Very personable and professional. Already looking forward to the next trip to Vegas. Thanks Michelle. The only item that was not valuable was the $10 credit for not doing housekeeping. Next time I will do the housekeeping.
50,As expected. The room is clean and we have a great view of the strip too.  The service is excellent too. Check-in and check-out are so easy and convenience.  I would definitely come back to stay here for another fun trip.
50,We stayed at Cesars for our 5 year anniversary. Our room was comped to us it was beautiful and exceptionally clean. The casino was large clean and had a wide variety of ways to play. The waitresses were attentive and prompt. We ate at 3 restaurants on campus and they were all wonderful!
30,I had a reservation #ZJ5NN made through the Caesar's website for a guaranteed rate of $141.00/night from 12/23 to 12/26/2019 with resort fees of $135.00 taxes $74.66; room total $632.66. I went to the front desk the evening of 12/25 to inquire whether we would receive a final bill so we could express checkout. I was handed a copy of my bill so far and instead of being charged $141.00 per night that my reservations stated I was charged $159 $165 and apparently $159 for the last night. I was also charged $51.02 per night resort for a total of $153.06. We were also charged $15.13 room service mini bar Keurig coffee. Shortly after check-in someone came to our room to check if our mini bar was fully stocked. She walked in with a Keurig coffee pack but there was one there and she left with it and then charged us for it. We never used the Keurig coffee pack. My husband who was also on the reservation and whose credit card was given at check-in was denied the ability to charge a $13.00 bottle of water from the essentials shop since I was the one who made the reservations. I then had to go to the front desk to have him added and had to give them an additional credit card. When I noticed the wrong room rates the lady at the front desk found the reservations and confirmed the rates were wrong. How can that happen? Caesars Palace is a huge organization computerized and cannot get the room rates right or resort fees right? I went again to the front desk before check-out and the gentleman who helped me was argumentative and stated maybe the room rates were wrong because there were two people in the room? My reservations specifically stated one room-two people. He also said the resort fee was different because the tax wasn't added? The continually charged mine and sometimes my husband's credit card throughout our stay and I asked at check out to pay the final bill. I was told and have in writing the final bill was $1247.34. After five days most of the interim charges dropped off and I was charged $1247.34 which was my balance after the $159.87 initial deposit. Then they charged an additional $79.93 after we checked out. Still do not know what that is for but I will continue to investigate. I have never been in a situation where I made a reservation and whatever was guaranteed on the reservation as changed after check-in. That is totally unacceptable and I will not stay at Caesar's Palace again because of this. The restaurants were great the rooms very nice but a corporation who cannot live up to their promises and try to nickle and dime their guests with erroneous charges is not professional and had caused me a lot of time to try and figure what was going on. And to have a front desk representative argue stupid reasons was just too much.
50,Great atmosphere the whole property is must walk thru. they did get tight on some of the crap bets too bad they got tight on those.  They have the best buffet in town. You might think it's pricey but for what you get it is cheap... food is the just as good as the high priced restaurants. worth every penny. we were there for a week and had to eat at their buffet 3 times it's that good.
50,Fantastic stay! I booked an extra long weekend in Vegas for my wife and I at Caesars Palace. I chose the Augustus Tower room with a strip view for firework viewing and couldn‚Äôt be happier with the choice. Caesars did everything right and I don‚Äôt have a single complaint or concern. We‚Äôre already planning our next trip in the spring!
50,We have Mr. Elpidio as our receptionist that very helpful for what we need. 10 stars for this guys :)  The suites room is very awesome clean room dining so delicious best location for celebrate our 2019 NYE!
10,As a diamond member I didn‚Äôt get upgrade for room and was lied for the view. Horrible sound isolation. Got waken up by high male singing jigsaw ppl talking at 5:30 am 6:45 am and 9 am. Worst hotel
40,We decided to make a trip to Vegas kinda last minute and stayed at Caesars Palace for the 1st time. It was a very nice resort. We normally stay on the south end of the strip so it was a change to stay in the middle of the strip. Nice area lots to see and do. It would have been nice to have a refridgerator in the room.
50,The parking is not wonderful although this establishment is very well kept. The slots were clean and the ashtrays were empty and cleaned as well. The shops are very nice also. Looking to book a room with Ceasars
40,Ceasar's Palace was always a place we wanted to stay at in Vegas. We booked a room in the Octavius tower and we were pleased with the ample room and the comfortable bed. The resort amenities were easy to access especially from this tower and the Augustus tower. The Qua spa and fitness center were good however for the amount of people in the resort the fitness center seemed a bit small. The spa however was good also. The area with hydrotherapy pools steam rooms and saunas were adequately staffed but seems a bit tight when crowded.(By the way if you are getting a massage there ask for Rob. He was amazing! Very professional and strong hands! Makes the high prices of the services worth it!) Lastly the restaurants were very good especially Cafe Americano which is the best option for a full-service breakfast spot. Pronto by Giada was not that good. The prices were too high and the frittatas we ordered were cold; however they were more than happy to heat it up again with no questions asked. Overall a very good place to stay at in Las Vegas.
50,The restaurants are great. The rooms are always nice and big and have comfortable beds. Augustus Tower offers great views of the strip and Bellagio fountains.Easy access to the strip and other casinos. Caesars casino offers a variety of slots and table games that will entertain anyone. Staff are friendly and helpful. Will always return to stay at Caesars when we can.
40,"Thanks to Michele and ""LeLe"" in the Diamond/Seven Star check-in for the lovely room in the Augustus Tower (3961). I had a great view of North Strip and the room itself was comfortable and well appointed. Internet worked well as did the heating (yes it was cold at night). The only complaint that I have is that room service while prompt and delicious was OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive. Breakfast for 1 person was $67 (gratuity automatically included). I spent less than half for the same breakfast at another property."
40,Those who have followed our reviews will remember we were here in 2017 and were wowed so we decided to come back for longer this holiday season.    This hotel remains grand and impressive everywhere you go with great photo spots everywhere and the best luxury shopping experience in Vegas.    Location wise you can‚Äôt go wrong especially for walking up and down the strip and enjoying good food at very fancy restaurants.    Our suite in the Augustus tower was huge and spacious with good views of the strip.    Room service and housekeeping were good and gave space and privacy as needed.    The food court was good with a good variety of food.    Pronto by Giada was where we spent most mornings for breakfast as it‚Äôs got a good variety and options - pay attention across the board high on the walls to see the lunches and dinners.    We didn‚Äôt visit Bacchanal this time due to the very long queues but we did the last visit and it was spectacular so yes worth the visit.    The gym has some good equipment and helpful staff.    Some things that need improvement:    - spa staff need to be more welcoming  - rooms need more supplies (shower gel bathrobes slippers)  - customer service overall. Everyone seems to be in a hurry to get people out in a hurry removes from the luxury experience  - information at check in should be a lot more overall beyond here is your room. Talk about wifi restaurants etc.  - fix your ride share area to have more indoor seating for the winters and helpful staff for questions.  - At least one or 2 pool could have been open as in other hotels nearby    Overall it was a good stay and you can‚Äôt fault the comfort and magnificence of Caesars with the forum shops and entertainment options.    Yes we would visit again as overall it is a very grand well decorated and well maintained hotel .
50,We stayed at Caesars in Las Vegas for Christmas. Danny at thr front desk did a great job of checjing us in on Christmas Eve. Our room in the Palace Tower was quite yet close to the action when we got off the elevator. Dinner at the Homestead Steakhouse never disappoints. A great time was had by all.
50,If you eat at any buffet in Vegas let it be the one at Caesars Place! The variety of food and the quality of food is well worth the $59 price. No matter what time of day this buffet is sure to have what you're craving. Definitely recommend!
50,The room I had was large and what a view of the strip. The staff went out of their way to help with every need I ask for. The buffet at Caesars's is out of this world. Everyone should try at at least once before you leave.
40,We decided to try out Caesar's for a change from the Bellagio. While the hotel rooms were nice the walking around part was so crowded and busy it took forever to get from one end of the hotel to anywhere (Starbucks in the morning for coffee into the mall etc). Lots of tourists watching the ceiling changing colors statues changing etc. Very friendly check in staff.
50,Harrah's is always our favorite. Always feel lucky. There was a lot of construction going on but it was still a great time. Will always stat at Harrah's always feels like home in Las Vegas. Food also was very good.
50,Caesars Palace always upgrades my room and treats me like a king. I would not stay anywhere else. The employees are always helpful and willing to do whatever they can to make my stay the best it can be. I will always stay at Caesars if I am in Las Vegas and at one of their properties outside of Las Vegas when I can. Highly recommend the Caesars family of hotels and casinos especially Caesars Palace.
40,Customer Service staff especially Michelle is very good and understanding. The rooms at the August and Octavious towers are clean and newer. The rooms at Julius tower needs to be renovated. They are very old and not well kept. But staff at Caesars are all very nice and helpful.
50,Please have dinner at Caesars you won‚Äôt be disappointed. I haven seen many shows there and no other venue can compare. The rooms and beautiful and staff attend to your every need. Caesars Forum is üëèüëè
50,We were located on the 38th floor over looking the water works across the street which was excellent. Our room service was excellent food was very good and hot. The slots were excellent they treated me with an 3700 Jack pot thank you once again CEASAR see you soon
50,Cesears is always our go to because the staff are amazing. The amenities never disappoint and overall experience is great. The staff explain in detail and help  You learn when on the floor gambling. Always enjoy seeing smiling employees
40,My first time to explore Caesar‚Äôs Palace casino and the Bacchanal Buffet.  A clean friendly place where the staff came around frequently while playing slots to provide beverages.  Slots and video poker machines paid about average thus it it didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äútight‚Äù. Bacchanal Buffet was worth every penny with so many options several which were unusual at a buffet: suckling pig marrow waygu beef and the sweetest Dungeness crab!  Looking forward to returning.
40,Location is good and the entire resort is very clean and tidy. Lots of restaurants to choose from. Bar drinks are some of the most expensive on the strip so be ready for that. Caesars Rewards does not show you love like they used to with comps and rewards. I was disappointed in how I was taken care of as a Diamond member that visits twice a year and gambles quite a bit exclusively at table games. From a gambling viewpoint I am interested in staying with the MGM properties in the future.
50,Everything was perfect from start to finish. Thanks to my host Lisa as well as my concierge hats off to them both. The staff exceeded any and all expectations I could have. With heartfelt gratitude üôèüèª
40,not bad at all.    i had fun and was winning    jdhgasdkjhgajd fhgadf hgdfuihguierhgiuerhfgkadfhjkahdfkgjadfhjadfhkajshdf asdhfsldkfhaksdhfaskdjhfakjsdhfakjsdharhgalkdfjhlksdfjhurhfvalkjsdfhvalkjsdfhglaksdfhr adfv
20,No upgrade offered. No upgrade provided. One party was seperated from a party of 5 to different Tower Room key did not work 3 times. Wifes name was not added to room folio. Entry was denied due to key failure. Sink Faucet was dead. No water and no handyman to fix issue. No pen and paper in room.
30,Rooms needed some Renos my sister and I stayed in diffirent floors but same buildings and our rooms were very dusty and due to the dust my husband became sick. As he started coughing and sneezing Dust were everywhere in the carpets and their chairs .Some of the customer service needs to be improved as well
10,Be very sure of everything you book. Tickets shows etc. Gordon Ramsys hostess are very rude and liars. Hotel management are clueless on what's going on in their hotels. Gamble slot and they still will not comp you anything not even 2 buffets.
50,We stayed in the Aurgusta Tower. The room was very nice.It was well furnished and had an exceptional vie with lots of gaming tables and slots  The casino is user friendly.  The location of Caesars was very convenient.  The rio italian restaurant was excellent
50,Centrally located resort with good amenities. Hotel staff is very helpful and this Ceaser propriety have very good restaurants as well. Being next to Promenade walk makes it more attractive.    I will highly recommend Linq
50,We had already booked a suite for our trip thank you Tony our host! Upon check in we asked about an upgrade to something that would blow our mind. Jay the man! Hooked us up with a 7 room penthouse for an added 250 a night. We walked in and was blown away! Tony our host and Caesars always delivers above and beyond. You think Im crazy paying 90 dollars for a buffet but OMG! bacchanal buffet at Caesars is mind blowing. All you can eat seafood like snow crab legs shrimp oysters sushi etc. So much more lamb chops pho soup dumplings steak. Its worth it and go hungry! Dessert bar amazing! Great Christmas trip!
40,Had a great time. Casino was nice and room were good. The bed was great and view was great. Food and bar choices were phenomenal. I would recommend this place highly. Would be 5 star but had a mishap at check in.
50,This is my second time staying at Caesars Palace and just like the first it was amazing!    From the front desk to the casino employees to people working in the the restaurants everyone was real pleasant and helpful. We stayed in one of the updated Forum rooms and it was beautiful and clean.    Caesars Palace is now one of my top hotels to stay in Vegas! I'm already planning another trip in April and will be staying there.
50,We recently stayed at Caesars right before Christmas. I love staying here when we come to Vegas. The rooms are terrific clean and well appointed. We had a beautiful view of the fountains and enjoyed watching them from our window. The casinos weren't nearly as busy as normal but everyone was friendly and helpful. While I didn't go to the spa this trip the Qua Spa is by far my favorite in Vegas. Highly recommend!!
40,The hotel location is excellent and it‚Äôs close to other casinos. Great restaurants and good food. We loved the shops inside the Cesar palace hotel. All Employees were polite courteous and always willing to assist you.
50,The rooms are the largest in Las Vegas and there are many 5 star restaurants and and a food court that has very reasonable prices. The casio is very clean anf if your a playinf then the beverages including alcoholic are free.
40,Fun place really nice rooms and a great casino. They have great restaurants and the place has great directional signs so you don't get lost and things are easily found. This is important because Caesars is huge.
40,hotel was good. room was nice clean and someone cleaned it daily. the walk from the parking garage to the hotel and registration lobby is far though so if you are bringing a kid and a luggage by yourself come back for the luggage later on when you figure out where you‚Äôre gonna stay.
50,For our recent visit to Caesar's we had requested connecting rooms with Strip views. We knew this would be difficult to get as our trip was over Christmas and the hotel unsurprisingly crowded. The initial set of rooms given were close but on different floors fine in every way but separate. We were disappointingly resigned to this but Gillian wasn't. She could have easily dismissed the issue. Instead she persisted entirely for our benefit. And she got it done. A heartfelt thank you to Gillian for making our stay supremely enjoyable. Unsurpassed quality service we will be back.
40,My experience with the room food and casino was fine it was the rewards desk and interaction that was an issue. The room was clean the food was great that I purchased and I like the food court. The cigar lounge was great-Montecristo and the diamond lounge was nice if you can get inm but they did not explain that feature to me correctly so I did not find out all the details until I went there.
50,had amazing time I especially love staying in Augustus Tower the most in comparison to other Towers. No need to go elsewhere Caesars is like it‚Äôs own town. Customer service is amazing and don‚Äôt forget to sign up for Rewards Card really worth it!
50,Being in So Cal we love coming to Vegas every 2-3 months for a quick getaway. Caesar‚Äôs is one of our favorite hotels to stay at. On this visit we had a comped room but were upgraded to a studio suite in the Palace Tower. It‚Äôs about 750 sq ft of luxury with 2 bathrooms! Seems silly for 2 people but was actually useful! Staff was very friendly anywhere we went. Vegas was so busy while we were there but Caesar‚Äôs is huge and can accommodate. We had a great time and hope to come back to Caesar‚Äôs soon!
10,The rooms had roaches and some of the managers were very nonchalant about the problem. It took two phone calls a message from to the online concierge and ultimately a trip down to the front desk to have the problem addressed. Unfortunately the room I was moved to also had roaches. There was also a billing problem. The only persons who were helpful were Shelley Wengle and Ivy whom I contacted online. I chose Ceasar's Palace based on past experience but left feeling very disappointed.
40,Large room and bath...very nice view overlooking strip. A lot of walking if going from towe to tower so if with friends or family be sure to stay in same tower. Loved to kiosk self checking and check out
50,just wanted to actually give a shout out to the ladies in the new member service desk christmas day 7PM They are awesome very friendly and shared a lot of information. I wish all service desk are like that!
50,Superb ambiance Clean tidy renovated rooms. Nice dinning options and shopping outlets within the Hotel. Extraordinary night club. Must stay for special occasions or celebrations to be remembered for life.    Hotel service folks everywhere to help out.
50,Very nice place good food excellent shopping stores good gambling option plenty restaurants and shows very friendly stuff and helpful and if you tying to book go with your host she will be very help full
40,Room was nice but door needed be fixed...too much slam noise when close and it does bother partner staying rest.Service was fine.  Need more Lower bet Blackjack Tables.Disliked Blackjack Tables kept dealt continuosly from machine.
30,Normally I expected a lot better from Caesars Palace but this time we experienced some very rude people working there. Specially the technician came to service the TV. Very unprofessional and rude. After several (3) calls to the front desk the technician never shows up. We called back to request that they come the next day since the original call was late at night. The next day after we came back to our room in the evening the TV still wasn't fixed. We called the front desk again and after about 30 minutes a technician shows up but couldn't turn on the TV either I told him to plug in the power. That worked but then he thinks that is because we didn't know but in fact we unplugged it the night before because the remote wouldn't turn it off and there was no other way to turn it off. He acts like we didn't know how to operate the TV.
40,Room 5320-only drawback there is no view from this room. I wish there was better ventilation to remove the smokiness in the casino area. Also we used Uber during the first 2 days of our stay pickup and dropoff was good. Unfortunately the next 2 days pickup was moved to the garage in the shopping area. Not convenient at all for my husband who has some mobility issues.
50,An awesome casino to visit ... did not get to experience the hotel but the casino had plenty of games to choose from and the shopping site seeing of the Forum were unbelievable. Slots were not as loose as I remember ... can loosen them up ... we just want to play you know you will get your money back. Did not experience any big winners (over the $1200 limit) ... need to fix this or we will not be back.
40,I always go to Caesars when in Vegas. I have a lot of history with this property but getting drinks is harder and harder. I sat at a $25.00 blackjack table for 30 minutes and never even got to order a drink. I don't mind losing money. I'm there to gamble but when I wager $25.00 every minute or two I would like to get a drink. I makes losing a little more bearable. Makes winning VERY VERY fun. I got up and went to another property won some and lost some. But at least I had a drink in my hand while doing so.
10,I booked 2 deluxe suites for my family for Christmas. Keys would not work. Concierge service was a joke. We asked for blankets for one of the bed as they did not have any and we were told they ran out. Of blankets for a suite?!? No parking except 7 stars. Thanks for ruining Christmas Caesars.
40,Buffet is awesome great selection and well prepared. Restaurant options are plenty to chose from. Lots of table game and slot options. Crowded though. Tend to increase minimums in evenings. Lively place. Music is loud.
50,Augustus tower is in a good location close to everything we enjoy not far from the lobby. Room was clean quite and roomy. Staff was very on top of everything. Was able to get served on in a reasonable time at Caesars Palace. Never had room service but my brother stayed at Bally's at the same time we were there and he thought room service was reasonably priced good food and got his food in very timely manner. My daughter and her husband also stayed at Bally's at the same time and said there room was very nice also.
50,Caesars Place is one of he best Hotel and Casino. Well rated for its cleaniness and also courteous service desk Employees. They provide their service at a very high professional level. It is one of the main reason i keep coming back.
30,It was good.rooms and towers are far first room allotted was differentconcierge was very good room service was goodbeautiful hotelwith parents its little tough to navigate in the hotelsome sort of mini vehicle inside hotel must be there
50,I stayed in the julius tower nice clean room.nice and quiet.beautiful view.casino was good cocktail waitresses were fast and very nice. I am a diamond player ive stayed at all the Caesars properties and caesars is my favorite.
50,Worth staying in this hotel with the fantastic experiences in terms of service and facilities. Its location and its proximity to other attractions is also a big factor. The shopping mall inside the hotel is also a plus factor.
50,Exciting fun and adventurous. It allowed me time to gamble in peace while my girl can go shopping see Some shows Have a nice dinner and relax wow I can do the very thing I enjoy doing which is Gambler. So thank you to the management team and staff for giving us a warm welcome and accommodating my needs. So I look forward to visiting again thank you
30,Las Vegas and Caesars is an exciting place to visit. The choices in entertainment excitement and unequaled anywhere in the world..    But you must pick your time to visit. I had the misfortune to be in Las Vegas for the 2007 NBA All star Game and Christmas in 2019. The city was incredibly crowded and the usual norms of civil society were regularly violated.    Of course the same could be said for NYE and certain conventions.    Unless you want the experience of too many people and an inability or incredibly long lines to eat sightsee or even walk around pick a different time.
50,Will you ever consider a non smoking gaming area or a central areas for aging baby boomers who are still walking but are challenged by the distances. Especially enjoyed the breakfast buffet Room was spacious and clean good water temperature and pressure.
50,Was there 4 days loved it everybody was so nice room was clean high up but clean beds very comfortable Recently lost my father he wanted to come back so bad I came for him He passed away August 24th My Father had so much good luck here so did I
50,Caesars Hotel is amazing. Lots of things to do and great food and service. Don‚Äôt even need to leave the hotel. It has everything you need from Top Restaurants to Top bars and Clubs and entertainment. Highest Recommended to Stay here and especially and take advantage and use their awesome Rewards system.
40,We called in for a breakfast as it come recommend to us by friends.  A word of advice is to get in line early as there can be a large queue.  Once in ... wow there‚Äôs loads and loads to choose from and all help yourself as many times as you can manage.  Pace yourself and choose your favourites.
50,First time staying at Caesars but been to Vegas many times. Great hotel fast check in. Used app to check in and was automatically upgraded. Nice touch. Room very clean spacious super quiet for sleeping. Hotel location was middle of strip which served us well. Nicely decorated for Christmas. Super busy time of year at hotel. Easy access to taxi service. Not sure I liked the layout of card tables and slot machines. A bit scattered all around. But enjoyed the variety and newer game selections. Great selection of dining options. Will offer comments on those restaurants in separate review. Easy checkout. Received text message the night before checkout with instructions on how to most easily check out. Thanks Ivy! Staff serving drinks at slots were always available super nice. Will definitely stay here again on my next visit.
40,Room was small but refurbished not too long ago. We ended up being trapped in Vegas due to closure of I-15 on our departure date. Normally we would leave about 7 in the morning but freeway did not open till after 10. We had to get a reservation for another night and knew they were totally booked. Arlette in the Diamond registration was able to arrange a late checkout for us and secure an additional night if we needed it. Truly exceptional performance.
50,This trip was to celebrate our 46th wedding anniversary. Caesars Palace was awesome. Their entire staff is excellent and they pay close attention to detail. Our room was big bright and very clean. The only thing I would have changed is that it was a bit chilly in the casino. It was cold outside so a little extra heat on the casino floor would have been nice. Everything else was perfect !!!
10,Make sure u do not touch the fridge.  Even if you do not consume any thing if you touch or check any of the drinks they are going to charge you 75 dollars. They believe it us too much work to come upstairs and see what you have used!!!  I am not sure why we r paying the resort fee too for no additional service!
50,Alex was amazing she made our check in experience very smooth and made us feel like priority customers. I would come back to stay at this hotel just because I know that this type of service is really rare to come across specially nowadays when everyone is rushing to just get you checked in.
50,I surprised my gf by booking 5 nights here for her 40th birthday.  Check in was easy and the gentleman on reception gave us a free room upgrade as it was a celebration which i thought was a nice touch.  We were put into the octavious tower room 6472 with views of the bellagio fountains and the paris eiffel tower.  The room was big and 2 queen sized beds with a big toilet and seperate shower room.    Just be aware ( virgin never told me ) but when u pay resort fees the hotel also take $40 per night deposit incase u spend on your room account i read this elsewhere before i travelled but wasnt told when we paid resort fees either spotted it on my bank message not a problem as i was aware if it.  Another thing to be aware of is the room mini fridge... IF YOU REMOVE ANYTHING ( even if you put it back in ) you are automatically charged for it.    But a great hotel plenty to do and see the shopping mall ( forum) is nice and big with plenty of shops and the casino os a great size.    Location is fab as its right on the strip.    Have comfy shoes as its huge and you will walk plenty.    Will i return yes deffo but in the summer when the pools are open.
50,My wife and I stayed at Caesars Palace in the Palace Tower. The room is modern and recently updated. Very comfy bed. Large bathroom with both a tub and separate shower. Private toilet. Very friendly staff. Great dining options on-site. I added many photos of this visit and will return. Management should be proud of the staff.
50,The beauty of Caesar‚Äôs Palace and the amenities offered can not be questioned. But what really blew me away on our recent visit was the customer service. With thousands of people and plenty of mega-money guests we were treated like royalty. So many people it seemed went out of their way to make us happy and the attention to detail was incredible.  In an area with many fabulous options there‚Äôs no question where we‚Äôll stay on our next visit.
30,Should not bring up prices for buffet on Christmas day adding up with nothing special but longer time to get in line . Should be have one line for Caesars Palace guests for the buffet ( that's why we are staying here). Internet devices were limited hope you guys can raise them up cause one family stays with at least one kid..Everything else was just fine. I know you guys are not going to listen but just my opinion .
10,Ceasars Palace used to be a top hotel in Las Vegas; no longer.  Staff were rude rooms are old and tired.  Had to pay to park at the very back of the hotel and walk a mile to get to registration.  Totally unacceptable; will not return
50,Stayed at Caesar‚Äôs Palace for 4 nights with family. We all had a great time. The ambience in the lobby and the casino was exceptional. The many restaurants and pubs make dining and drinking a pleasure. The room was very comfortable spacious well appointed and very clean. The bathroom was spacious and comfortable. I asked for help with a small item and they sent someone from housekeeping right away. Great service.
10,Extra $85 per Night charge for a PET plus $51 RESORT FEES! Ended up to pay $340 per NIGHT!!! 6 oz bottle of water costs $9. They riffed off every dollars  Very small room sink water came out so little very hard to turn the sink handles.
50,Excellent room and services. I loved the spaciousness of the rooms along with the fact that it had 2 bathrooms! Great stay and will come back again. The $90 valet parking for 3 days stay seemed a bit steep but otherwise it was a great experience
20,Good: very central location great Forum shops great food court    Bad: $18/night parking $51 resort fee that limits Wifi acess for only 2 devices Bucchannel Buffet quality has declined so much that it is no longer justifies $70 per person cost.
50,Went to Vegas for a family a vacation right before Christmas. Great service and comfort. The entire experience was exemplary. From the food to location and quality it was all top notch at the Nobu/Caesars. Sports book staff was awesome and everything is within walking distance.
30,Booked the Augustus Towere Spa room. $1000 per night for 6 nights. Expected VIP treatment but received far less. Don't want to go into too much detail but I could have booked a basic room and saved the money since the level of service was not anything special. The room itself was amazing. The spa bathroom was incredible. No instructions on how to use some of the spa amenities but we figured it out. I expected more from Caesars.
50,Property is beautiful. Ray at registration was amazing and very helpful. We had a great time and vacation. B Hotel was full of people having fun. I highly recommend going to Caesars Palace at any time. It's an incredible experience!
50,if you have any ambulatory problems/issues this may not be the hotel. Distance from the parking lot ] to our room was quite far. This would have been a problem for Grandpa. My daughter and I were able to put in a lot of steps and get some exercise so that was a bonus for us.
50,Staff takes customer service personally...very friendly helpful and knowledgeable. Bed was comfortable. Would have liked refrigerator in room for my use. Overall a Great experience! Would definitely do Caesars palace again.
20,Terrible service from Ceasars Palace. Nice place but when they are full you can forget about customer service. Don‚Äôt think I will ever be staying here again. So much money spent for 2 star hotel quality services. Spent over 3 hours waiting on my luggage to get to my room.
40,good. comfiy  sutable  relxing it was a great trip for the expensise that we accuired  very refrashing it was very safe frindly envirment I had to call my brother from california to join me wich he did so i swich hotels to accumodate us we were so happy buy extinding our say form seven days to forteen days . it was a blast and I thank god for that family time
50,If you only experience Caesars Palace for the day and a night you will enjoy it. However if you only get to experience one day and night you will want to come back and experience another and another and another... If gaming is not your forte you will find plenty of places to shop and eat.
50,We stayed in the Augustus tower. This is my favorite due to proximity to main casino and Las Vegas Boulevard. Great little bar/restaurant (Cafe Americano) when you hit the main floor. Forum shops are great - ate most meals there (Joe‚Äôs the Palm Sushi Roku) and did my gift shopping.
10,I dont know what happened to Customer Service but the quality went down and the extra for everything is the new norm they charge for making coffee in the room they charge to connect 2+ devices to WIFI etc
50,Excellent location staff and restaurants. Rooms are spa and well appointed. Didn‚Äôt win money this time but had an excellent time. The facilities are clean and always fun to walk the Forum Shops. There were several tables available for play.
50,I flew in from Europe for a 5 nights Christmas stay at Caesars Palace. The checkin at the Diamond desk was efficient and still not lacking personal attention. Since I didn't speak English Eric got an interpreter online. I was upgraded to a stunning Octavius Tower room with beautiful pool area views. The bedding was incredible and helped me get over the jet lag overnight. The hotel is themed around Julius Caesar's Rome with columns and abundant marble. It is nested in the mid Las Vegas strip area with superior amenities and dining venues. Caesars Palace is packed with some of Vegas‚Äô best entertainment and nightlife options. There‚Äôs something for everyone. I also spent half a day at the hotel‚Äôs Forum Shops mall.  5 stars to Caesars Palace.  5 stars to Eric for making my stay even better.
50,Excellent room!!! Very clean and comfortable bed! Overlooking the pool area although it was closed for the winter time. Gambling area wasn‚Äôt that great for us but we really enjoyed the shops and food court area. Other restaurants were not for us but they were nice. Very disappointed with the buffet... no salad bar and limited regular food for people who don‚Äôt like to venture outside their comfort area with food. Had a great seafood option though!
50,Best resort on the Vegas strip. Still has beat in food show and games. Hotel rooms are clean. Service is always amazing. If you are a gamer they have a high selection of tables and slots. Also it is in the best location on the strip.
40,"Caesars offers an excellent location in the center of the strip. Restaurants provide an excellent variety of offerings. Lobby bar provides a great venue for people watching and having a nightcap. While there we took in the Brooks & Dunn concert. While we didn't take it in on this trip we have attended the show ""Absinthe"" during past visits and can highly recommend it."
50,What can I say the Total rewards network is huge. I always have a nice strong drink at Caesars Palace and enjoy that the total rewards network card is everywhere on the strip. I spent December 2019 at the place and look forward to another trip.
50,I was contacted by phone upon landing at the airport was met at the specified entrance and led and directed to VIP check-in on arrival by the Total Rewards director who visited with me while I was checking in. She then placed two bottles of cold water in my carryon and saw that I had assistance with my carry on bags to my lovely suite. The graciousness extended to me was exceptional! Kudos to all the VIP staff!
50,We had a gorgeous room overlooking the fountains at Bellagio and the strip. The restaurants are excellent. We dined at Hell's Kitchen for lunch. The food and drinks were great and the wait staff very attentive. Our favorite restaurant was The Old Homestead Steak house. My husband and I have enjoyed this restaurant twice and both times the food and drinks were amazing.  The Nobu restaurant is a unique experience and will definitely be goingback soon.
50,Very convenient  Prime location I love the restaurant and entertainment  Can wait to return  Ceasers knows how to treat people  Stand out for the others casinos  Great atmosphere great vibe  All around great experience
50,Great Buffet We visited at 10:30 and payed Breakfast price but by 11 AM they had started to put lunch meals out. The variety of dishes were plentiful.Best of all they still have servers to take and bring your beverage to your table also serve fresh orange juice.We used to think that the Bellagio had the best Buffet but more recently they started all self service with Minute Maid orange juice in plastic glasses.We played a little in the casino at Caesars and the servers visited frequently and were all very nice. We didn‚Äôt win any money but overall it was a great experience.
50,Enjoyed another fabulous stay at the Caesars Hotel & Casino Las Vegas. During this trip I met a very helpful and friendly customer relations person at the Caesars Rewards Desk named Christine ... who went far beyond expectations to help me on an issue with my Rewards Players card. As a former business owner ... I must say her desire to help and overall professionalism was inspiring ... and I would bet she will be very successful in any challenge or position offered. Thank's Christine!
30,We booked an Augustus strip view Suite for our family Christmas trip. Yes the suite was beautiful but it's all a facade. Beautiful couch? Rock hard and unsuitable We couldn't sit on it. Spa jetted tub? Didnt work. But most annoying of all? You nickle and dime your hotel guests for things other hotels freely offer. I'm an M Life member and have stayed all over the strip NEVER have I paid for a suite and been told I'll be charged an extra $75 just to use the fridge in my room. You filled it with the cheapest beer put a $20 price tag on each bottle and a sign that threated a $75 charge if we use it for our personal items? That's pretty low brow for such a high class place. My kids couldnt even keep leftovers. $18 a day to park where we are already paying to stay?? I booked your hotel to wow my teenagers on their first trip to Vegas I found myself wishing we had stayed at NY NY.    On a positive note the gentleman at the small desk near the check in kiosks (dec 20th) was really wonderful and the cleaning crew does an absolutely gorgeous job maintaining the hotel. Your hotel may be visually stunning but that's all you have.
50,I had plans for a Christmas vacation fall through at the last minute due to someone cancelling on me and decided less than 4 days before arrival to go to Vegas instead. I gave Caesar's Palace a quick phone call and was able to get reservations in Augustus tower on short notice. I am a diamond rewards member and diamond checkin was busier than normal but I was still able to get checked in to a great fountain view room just a little after 11am after a very short wait and excellent service! They also had some fresh coffee and snacks in there while I waited. Everyone I interacted with for my entire stay was super. From the bellman/valet where the limo dropped me off to diamond checkin staff to bartenders to security and especially housekeeping staff and the staff in the Laurel lounge everyone was in a good mood knowledgeable and friendly and I wanted for nothing my entire stay (except maybe some gambling wins!)    The property was decorated extraordinarily nice for Christmas and it was such a pleasure to just be in such a beautiful environment my entire stay especially considering the trip was thrown together last minute. I was in an Augustus Strip View king non smoking room and this is one of my favorite rooms in all of Vegas. The beds and pillows are comfortable as can be and for being right on the strip it's been pretty quiet every time I've stayed there. Also the view of the Bellagio fountains and center strip from the south facing Augustus rooms is one of the best views in Vegas!    It's got a huge open feel in Augustus rooms that I really enjoy. I've seen some folks on the internet comment that Augustus rooms are small for the price but that is just delusional. At 650 square feet the Augustus premium rooms are one of if not the largest standard rooms in Vegas in terms of square footage and they are even larger than lower level suites at most properties. Also the bathrooms are top notch in all Palace Octavius and Augustus rooms I've seen with nice big jetted tubs and separate showers double sink counters and water closets with closing doors. My room for this trip was spotless clean everything worked properly and room was in perfect condition and didnt have any peeling wallpaper or chipped furniture or anything like that like I've seen several times in other Vegas properties. No funny smells and no weird noises. Everything was great and I was thankful to get to spend Christmas in such a great place!    I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of my most recent stay there over Christmas which was my 4th or 5th stay at Caesar's Palace this year. I come back because it's one of the nicest places in Vegas in my opinion with probably THE best variety of eating shopping gaming and A list entertainment in Las Vegas or almost anywhere.
30,I was expecting more for how much my husband and I paid for our room. While the room itself was very nice and clean for the most part. I was not expecting to find garbage behind the furniture and Crumbs all over every chair and couch in our room. Not only that but I am a housekeeper and I was highly disappointed with how housekeeping entered my room and moved things around while we had our Do Not Disturb sign on the door! Not to mention we opted out of housekeeping because I know how hard the job is! We had a great time but our room was where we were supposed to be relaxing and nope I was cleaning while on my vacation. I'm only salty because we paid a lot and i do this for a living. Didn't want to be doing so on my vacation.
50,Best place to stay gamble and eat. They have everything. We always adventure down the strip and end up right back home at Caesars. Our room in the Augustus tower was amazing. With a huge bathroom and super comfortable bed.
50,I was really impressed by Caesar‚Äôs Palace on my first visit to Las Vegas. The room was great and there was so much to eat and do. In particular I would like to thank Arlene at the self checkout desk for quickly and efficiently resolving a billing question. She is so thoughtful and friendly!
40,Ceasars Palace has never disappointed. We have always enjoyed our stay with their main facility. However this time of year seems to bring on less hospitality or employee courtesy than any of our previous visits. It was not a visit for the story book.
50,Caesars rooms are always clean and well maintained it has lots of good food restaurants take away at food market . Food is a tad too pricey. One thing i noticed was the slots . Very very tight. Getting a bonus is next to impossible. Getting a bonus is a definite NO. It was better at Paris Flaminga Ballys.  The SPA at Caesars is a special experience. The massage therapist Anthony  a new addition to their SPA goodies is amazing and gives great deep tissue massages . Looking forward to my next trip esp for the massage. Food at Paris is awesome. Their SALMON has got to be the best. The hospitality at PARIS BUFFET has got to be the best. Love going there year after year
50,They upgraded us to a suite that had a great view and we went to order pillows and duvet for our bed so comfortable. Great place to stay. Food was a little high but I see why rated the best buffet in Las Vegas.
40,5th year coming to Las Vegas for the holidays amongst many other trips. Overall underwhelmed by even the upgraded room. Proud Caesar‚Äôs Palace card member regardless but keep it in the rotation of Mlife Wynn Venetian/Palazo Station Casino‚Äôs and several downtown properties. Caesars does however continue to provide a quality dining experience and inventive shows and performing rotating acts! Don‚Äôt skip one of their properties.
50,Stayed at the Octavius room at the caesars palace. Room was very clean and view was amazing! The bathroom was top notch with big tub. When you visit vegas I recommend staying at the Octavius room. It a bit of a walk from the front desk but its close to pool and Bacchanal Buffett.
40,the food was great we ate at the buffet and the steak house. the room was great and over looked the fountain next door and had a view of the Paris and the strip. if you come by limo like we did go to the side entrance and avoid the rush in the front of the casino
50,Had a great dinner at Hell's Kitchen...a true dining ex po experience and super nice staff. The newest renovated suites were so enjoyable...super classy. I hope to return soon to pick up where we left off.
40,We stayed at the Augustus tower for those like me who like an in room jacuzzi this one has one that can accomodate 2 people of average size. The room was clean and in good shape. The Caesar Palace overall is a beatiful place to stay. The problem is the nickle and diming has gotten out of hand. I am ok with resort fees there is no way around that but now the charge you for wifi $15 if you add more than 2 devices which is ridiculous since they are charging a resort fee.  I probably won‚Äôt come back because I don‚Äôt want to support these practices.
50,I enjoy staying on this side of the strip. I love coming to Caesar‚Äôs Palace every time I get the chance. When I‚Äôm offered free stay here I‚Äôm always grateful for that. I enjoy the gaming here as well. I‚Äôve always recommended this property to others.
50,room was gorgeous and spotless clean. plenty of options for food and beverage. Excellent sportsbookhowever disappointed had to pay for seats. baccanal buffet is something everyone should experience. overall positive experience
50,Friendly courteous & professional staffs....Nice decorated casino with so many gaming options to choose from. It has a lot of promotion & generous of offer.  A lot of name brand shopping to select from...
50,Exceptional service!  Kind employees!  Great management!  Great food! Good amenities!  Easy to check in & out!  Lots of game selections!  Excellent shopping items to choose from!  We can‚Äôt wait to stay at CAESARS soon!  Thank you!
50,Great time had room upgraded to a suite plenty of room for all of us. Food is delish anywhere you eat at Ceasar's. Great slots to play. Employees are very helpful in anything you need. After 5 days it was time to return home but we had a blast and will certainly be back.
50,I had a wonderful visit to Caesars Palace with my family. The food and drinks were phenomenal. The employees provided top customer service and remained friendly and professional at all times. My family and I will definitely be back to visit soon!
50,This is an excellent location for a stay in Las Vegas. Spacious rooms friendly staff. We were in a two room suite that was lovely with a large sectional couch. Room service is readily available. Several dining options but I will not go back to Rao's.
40,room was excellenet view was amazing service was excellent. We gambled and eat at Gorden Ramzey's restaurant. The food was amazing atmesfear was wonderful. I would defenitly recomend the hotel to all my family and friends.
30,During my last few hours in my room the bathroom ceiling started to leak water very rapidly I immediately called the front desk while leaving my clothes makeup flatiron and phone which all got soaked and damaged. Evidently the guest above our room left the bathtub running so the water did eventually stop pouring in. But after that we had 4 people come to our room the ceiling began cracking and not one person offered to clean the water which at this point was already flowing to the room carpet. The last woman who entered our room then asked if we‚Äôd like her to clean it up???? In my opinion that should have gone without asking and been done immediately. I did contact the concierge who I explained about the damages and all that she could do is provide a number to security. It is the holidays and I haven‚Äôt really had the chance to even call I am beyond frustrated with the cost that has now come out of my pocket. So although most of the experience was great this left me very disappointed.
50,It was a very fun trip. The location was perfect. The brunch buffet at Giada‚Äôs was very delicious. The registration person from the Carolinas was very welcoming and helpful. My first room in the Palace Towers was fabulous.
50,Didn‚Äôt have to leave the casino/hotel for anything. Plenty of slot Machines. Room was nice and clean. Bars were quick to serve and the bloody Mary‚Äôs I had were pretty good. Would definitely stay again
50,Room was nice and comfortable. Very large room and clean. The casino was very clean and enjoyable. It was a great experience to be in that hotel and great area near the strip and shops. Best trip in the best hotel to be in
50,Rooms are nice and clean staff is friendly and helpful. Casinos where good and actually paid out with plenty of tables to select from. Only negative was not enough restaurants to select from with in the hotel but great restaurant near by.
40,We were assigned to a room that was already occupied. This made us make another trip to the front desk very inconvenient and not a good experience. They apologized and discounted our stay by taking off 1 nights resort fees
10,The hotel doesn't prevent criminals from coming upstairs throughout the day/night. No security at hotel elevators and the hotel should prevent random people whi are not guests up to the hotel floors! Please upgrade security.
40,The stay was wonderful. The time of year is cold and there casino was quite comfortable. No wait in elevator was big for me especially during peak times. Room was clean housekeepers were friendly. The slots were pretty loose this time
50,Great center location on strip close to everything. Lots of things to see and do. Lots of shopping and restaurant options. Christmas decor is the best. Always a must go to casino/hotel when in Vegas to play or shop.
50,If you are in Vegas for the first or one hundredth time you have to check out Caesar‚Äôs palace. The decor and design of the building are stunning there are thousands of shops to explore and many games if you are there to gamble. Although it is a little on the pricey side it is still a once in a lifetime experience.
30,room was very good and ample. ceasars lost its personal touch like in the past. yes we traveles with. ‚Äúwhales‚Äù‚Äù ( sy lichten) my father in law but this new ceasars too large and impersonal. wife probably will go to smaller hotel like flamingo. next time ill open credit line there
50,Just returned from a fabulous trip to Las Vegas. Stayed at Caesers! My Host Geoffrey Gregory is the best! I will always call him before I make my plans... The staff made it they‚Äôre job to make sure I had everything I needed.
40,If you want to stay in a place where you can have a bit of luxury that does not break your bank account I suggest Ceasars. The rooms are cleean and Updated I suggest asking for an Upgrade. Also I suggest becoming a Ceasars rewards member. The benefits you get at Platinum are worth while
40,Im Happy the place is excellent service need improvements maybe next time I visit i will see the difference thank you see you soon. I'm a Diamond member. Hopefully you can give me freebies next time.
50,Traveled with friends for a 4 day vacation. We ended up staying an extra day because we were having so much fun. Also the view of Bellagio fountain from our room was fantastic.  We had several meals at Noodle 9 that exceeded our expectations.
50,The spa was AMAZING!!!! I felt like I was in a Roman bath house. The staff in the spa were so inviting and made me feel so comfortable especially Vida. Our room was great. Every single hotel staff member was polite and extremely friendly. Highly reccomend.
50,Enjoyed room location to relationship to casino floor. Flelt comforable with environment and security while traveling through Harrah's Resort. II missed not having a refrigerator in my room. I liked the location and ease of locating the ice machine. I plan to check out the spa tub my next visit.
30,Everything was exceptional except for the fact that a refrigerator and microwave are something you have to pay extra for. There is even a sign that says if you use the refrigerator there is a $75 fee on the outside of it. A refrigerator should not be a Luxury in hotel in my opinion.
50,Gemma was the lady that checked us in and I must say she was the most helpful and friendly person that we ever met in the many times that my wife and I have been to Las Vegas. We asked to get a nice room and she delivered. She put us in a different tower and the room was located close to the elevators with a very nice view. We also asked for a refridgerator in the room to keep our medications. That was delivered to the room in minutes after we got to our room. We hope to see her again on our next visit in a month or two. It would be in Caesars best interest if she would train other people to be customer friendly as she was with us. Thank you  Gemma ... and Merry Christmas to all !!
10,I adored this hotel and we would stay here at least 4 to 5 times a year. We've been coming here for years now and never had any issue. But early this morning someone came into our locked suite while we were asleep and stole over $10000 in cash and jewelry. WE WERE IN THE ROOM! How creepy! We should of put it all in the safe but we were in the room! We reported it and security came and filed a report. They said they would be back in 30min  No one ever came back. We went downstairs to the security office and they said that the shift left and nothing will be handled until the next shift. Are you kidding me? They can see who came into our room on the camera but instead they are going to let this person walk with our stuff?Management is handling it poorly. Very upset that they are diminishing the severity of this situation. The money and jewelry is replaceable. Our safety is not. Somehow someone got key card for our room. Not to assume anything but most likely someone's selling key cards and is in on a scheme or someone at the front desk accidentally made a key card for a occupied suite. For this too be happening at a higher end hotel is just absurd!
50,Stayed at Ceasar's Palace for early Christmas present. I would like to commend Eric at diamond registration. Very efficient and made check-in easy and noted my requests we're already fulfilled. This is great! Great customer service
50,We love staying at Caesars and have been doing so every year since 2008. Checking in we had the pleasure of meeting Mehret. She is awesome personified! A model employee who needed to be recognized here. Thanks again Merhet!
40,We had a great trip and our stay at Caesars was great!    I have one complaint though. I think it is unfair to price gauge water. A small bottle will run anywhere from 6-12$. After being in a climate controlled environment where everything costs a ton the least the hotel can do is offer water to its guests.    Other than that... thumbs up
50,Caesars is definitely a central location and a popular place to stay. it was crowded and busy during our entire stay. Everyone was nice. The room was nice. The prices at the restaurants were a little high. The mini bar prices are INSANE. The CVS 2 blocks away does an awesome business by selling stuff at a somewhat normal price. Seems like the hotel pushes people away by pricing things this high. I'm sure they prey on drunk people and high rollers who don't care about the $$
50,We usually travel to Vegas as a big group. Usually it‚Äôs 12-14 of us. We have a wonderful time and make new memories. This year we had the privilege of staying at this wonderful hotel. It was an amazing experience and the room was excellent.
10,What a big let down. Toilet was clogged. Bathroom door needs repair. Is that blood or lipstick on the toilet? Not sure what it was but I don‚Äôt think it should be there. Went to the buffet as it was awesome last few times we were there. This time it was sub standard. Is Caesar under new management that aims for mediocrity? Manager in front desk seems to be having a bad day. Maybe they don‚Äôt even take good care of their employees anymore?
50,Caesars is a great hotel location on the strip it has easy access to the whole strip. The property is well maintained and the room was clean and modern. The only one draw back is the coffee k cups are for a fee $14 not good.
50,We have been to Vegas many times but this was our first stay at Caesars. Because we got lucky we were given a junior deluxe suite. What a treat. The shower was bigger than my whole bathroom at home! The entire property was spotless the staff were friendly and accommodating. And the choices for gaming were endless. The level of clientele was a notch higher than other places - not obnoxious or seedy looking. Will definitely come back again.
50,Warm welcome with a friendly fun atmosphere and very clean! Comfortable beds and friendly staff. We ate at Gordan Ramsay Pub & Grill and the food & service was amazing we highly recommend this place.
10,Overall bad experience. Staff wasn‚Äôt friendly and made me feel very unwelcome. Players Club and Casino Host kept passing me off to each other although they did nothing to fix the situation. Checked out early.
50,I only gambled here was fun. I would recommend Caesar‚Äôs Palace lots of shops and things to see and do.Good location on the strip close to everything.Large gaming area for slots and huge sports book. I will stop in again next time I‚Äôm in town.
50,Our room is a junior suite. The room is spacious very comfortable and clean. The bathrooms stands out. There are 2 bathrooms. One bathroom has a bidet and a bathtub. It has a refrigerator with snacks and drinks for a fee. Looking for a place to eat is not difficult. There are good fast food restaurants and excellent gourmet restaurant in the property. My wife enjoyed shopping at the forum.
10,worst visit in yearsno customer service what so ever will not stay there again i am a diamond club member but that does not mean anything when it comes to customer service i will not be staying at cesars in the future plus the rom was dirty
50,Michelle at Diamond Reception in Caesars Palace was friendly gregarious efficient and went out of her way to ensure we were placed in the tower we wanted to stay in She made us feel extremely welcome.
40,The room was beautiful. My fiancee and I had a great time up until the last night of our stay. The food was great. Be sure to get to the buffet line early seat fill up fast. Overall a great experience.
50,I took my son out to Las Vegas for his 21 birthday and we stayed at Caesars Palace. I highly recommend it. We had a great time making memories. One of the best moments was hitting the $100 on #17 at Caesars Palace on Roulette. The second was attending the two country music shows/concerts:  Hayden Baker at the Cannery Casino and Cody Johnson at the HardRock Casino both great shows.    #CaesarsPalace #MarchMadnessNextUp
50,Stayed at Caesars for over 11 years. Their employees are very professional and helpful. Always ask questions when you have a problems just call the receptions desk or the number for problems. Never really have problems.
50,Hotel strip view excellent staff great location friendly workers. I can't wait to return again one day!  We went for my husband's birthday and have not one complaint. The restaurants were all amazing the layout is perfect as well as the location. I have never had such great service from all aspects of a hotel from the concierge to the bell desk to the cocktail waitresses to all restaurant employees and check-in associates.
50,Great location on the Strip. Easy to walk to anywhere you want to go on the strip. Friendly staff great food experiences in the Caesars resorts with lots of options to choose from. Caesars is a clean well appointed hotel with lots of shopping nightlife and entertainment.The casino is clean well lit and easy to get around. The entertainment centre has great celebrity shows to enjoy.
50,The room was clean and spacious. Note to self take Keurig cups The beds are great and you don‚Äôt hear a lot of noise from the hallway. The self check in is great and you can avoid the lines. The people at the bell desk were great too
50,I visited Caesars to have a few drinks and gamble in the casino. The staff were warm and friendly. Drinks were good and comped while playing. The casino was very nice with a fun and welcoming atmosphere.
50,Everything is first class from the room to the employees. There was top notch service in each and every sector the room housekeeping casino and restaurants. I will definitely stay there again next time I'm in Las Vegas.
40,Good experience overall during my stay at The Flamingo. Close to cheap food and easy access to all the other casino's on the strip.    Spa and workout area were nice. They also have a little flamingo sanctuary.
40,Bought a package at a charity auction. Great experience and very nice suite. Staff is friendly and helpful! I would definitely stay again. Great location and go see Absinthe! Still a great show not as good as previous casts but on top of Vegas shows.
50,When arriving at the property Caesars Palace treats you the best. Valets greet you with a warm reception and handle all your pre stay needs. Registration gives the best room they can for your stay. Casino employees made the gambling action so much better. Great times at Caesars!
50,Very nice rooms in the Augustus tower. Excellent location at center strip. Very friendly staff all throughout the property. With a property of this size there is something for everyone at Caesars Palace.
50,We received a free upgrade for our room. The room was absolutely clean as were the hallways as well. The casino area was very clean and pretty much free of that casino smoke smell so may Las Vegas casinos have. The staff was courteous and friendly as well.
50,Had a great time at Caesars this December. Stayed in room 4278 Augustus Tower. Fantastic room. High up and quiet with great views of Strip and Bellagio Fountains. Also close to elevator and ice machine! Who could ask for more??
40,The property lives up to its reputation. Clean and great tables and drinks. Food options galore and Absinthe is a great show. The casino hosts are tight so don‚Äôt expect much for free. If your looking for a company try another property.
40,The room was nice with a view of the Bellagio fountain but you have to pay for the coffee in your room and the amenities were average. I stayed at Bellagio and compared to Caesars they have better amenities robe slipper and  the bathroom amenities kits were great
20,The rooms are nice if you just plan to stay there and pay the premium cost tough there are enough other options which offers the better experience by all mean. Not just the room. Also not to mention this is probably the worst place to Gamble in Vegas.
50,Stopped in for a bit of gambling and a great dinner at the Homestead ...üëç awesome food and great personal service. It never disappoints...been there previous and look  forward to our return visit. I always recommend for anyone...don‚Äôt forget to try the Madagascar Schrimp
30,trying to straighten out issues with management will follow up...ther wre a few bumps in the road at first but finally worked out most isuues...they want more words but not ready to commit a ful review till management is given a chance to resolve problems from recent stay.
40,The best casino on the strip great environment dealers are respectful and the floor supervisor has great problem solving skills. I will definitely be back I have never felt as comfortable as I did in here with other casinos.
50,I loved Caesars Palace this was the first time we stayed there. It was amazing great staff very friendly. The concert was amazing. Sunday Morning brunch was excellent. Check in and out was very easy.
50,The casino is beautiful. Plenty of shopping and food to choose from lots of gambling to choose from. If theres a casino.that has it all this one definitely is! Staff is always smiling and helpful. the rooms are beautiful and clean one of the best sleeping experiences love their beds.
50,The bartenders in the Laurel Lounge are the best in Vegas! Always get the best service and drinks. They are the best!! Richard Gonzalez is the friendliest most engaging and amazing bartender on the strip. He makes everyone feel completely at home and makes the best drinks by far!
20,"Room was older and furniture very beat up -- looked like it had not been updated in 20 years. $45/day ""Resort fee"" when most of the resort amenities are closed (all pools but one are closed). Only 2 devices included in resort fee for wifi. No free coffee in the room. Our room was located above one of the nightclubs/bars. The bass was so loud it shook our room. DO NOT ACCEPT ROOM 5011 in the Forum tower."
40,The room was great. The service of the staff was great with the exception of our host that never once returned out calls in the past or present. In the past we missed 3 bookings because she DID NOT bother to return our calls at all. Attempted to book direct but was told I had to go thru my host. Host (Vivian aka Wei Wei) wanted me to call her on this last visit the day before we depart but she never returned out calls or text. Too stressful dealing with that host. We do not complaint or ask for any special treatment so it's no excuse. We are not alone from what 2 other guest told me so I didnt feel too offended. She is ijust in the wrong position.
30,The casino itself was fine and busy as expected. There were plenty of food options inside Caesar‚Äôs to where you almost didn‚Äôt have to leave the hotel at all. Expect to pay high prices for food which while good were exorbitant in price. The room (The Forum tower) needs much better carpeting. The carpeting in the hallway had such a design to where you could have a seizure. It was such a weird and chaotic design and was ugly. The rooms were average size just plain with old furnishings. There was a clock radio almost as old as me on the nightstand. Nice television. Bedding was lumpy and the down pillows were extremely uncomfortable and did not make for a good sleep. I loathe down pillows because invariably the feathers will poke through. I don‚Äôt even know why the hotel still offers them. The black out curtains were helpful. A nice touch was the responsive personal concierge. I texted her once for body lotion and she was very quick to respond and the lotion add in the room when we returned from our outing. Overall just an average older hotel and nothing spectacular about it. Spend your money elsewhere.
40,Flamingo Hotel and casino.  ‚ÄúIt was clean and staff were friendly and very helpful. We really enjoyed staying there.‚Äù    ‚ÄúExcellent hotel. Excellent location. Excellent staff. Excellent stay. Nothing to add.‚Äù
50,From the Valet to check in the restaurants bars and Casino floor the employees are second to none.  They are all very pleasant and caring and always willing to help with all your requests.  They rooms are always exceptionally clean and well maintained.
50,Excellent stay as always. Clean. Spacious room and excellent service. A few amenities such as bottled water and complimentary coffee in the rooms would make this an actual 5 star experience.Those little touches actually make a difference.
50,Ceasar has always been my home away from home. The vip service is top notch. Gorden Ramsey hells kitchen and gorden Ramsey the pub are mine and My wife's favorite. Ceasar palace has never disappointed us. The rooms are extremely clean.
50,We had a great time and visited a few of the Caesars hotels. All were clean and the staff was always there to help if needed. Shopping at Caesars was great and lots to see. Great atmosphere. Would definitely go back again.
40,Rooms are nice tables staff in the casinos are friendly. The buffet was good with an amazing selection of desserts. I would definitely return. Only wished that there were a better selections of seafood on a Friday.
40,The room was clean and organized. The entire hotel was spotless. Friendly staff and speedy service. Cannot wait to return. Great location on the strip tons of amenities close by the resort. Easy to get around and the knowledge of the staff helped me settle in and relax.
50,On my recent trip to Las Vegas I stayed at Caesars Palace. The rooms were nice clean and well maintained. There are great stores in the forum shops and plenty of choices for food. If you want to dine at Hell‚Äôs Kitchen I recommend you make your reservation in advance.
30,It is just about the center of the strip. There are about two dozen hotels in this stretch in all price ranges. None awful some stunning. Caesars Palace was awesome but pricey My sister previously stayed at the Luxor but she said that was just too far south for her taste.
50,This trip was excellent! My host took care of me and I really enjoyed my 3 day stay. This was my 3rd trip this year to Las Vegas and every time I leave always not wanting to leave. Thank you again for the great service!
40,Never disappointed with the cleanliness of the rooms and how accommodating the employees are. The one thing I love about Caesars is the numerous shops there is no need to leave the premises because everything you need/want is just steps away.
10,Rooms need a good cleaning; few tables open most hours arrogant hosts. The resort fee is completely ridiculous and prices in restaurants are outrageous. Will shout out to two friendly dealers Benny and Olivia. Outside of those two rude we be my best description of the others. The sports book was excellent and the personnel there very friendly.
50,"Had a great guys weekend at Caesars this past weekend. I matched status to get to Diamond with Total Rewards and Debub in the Diamond check in lounge was INCREDIBLE! Did an awesome job working with us to make sure we were taken care of and explained everything cleary and concisely on our stay and with the bill. She absolutely ""exceeded my expectations"" as they say. I was a Platinum with M Life but I may just switch to TR because of Debub!"
40,"The staff was very friendly and the food at the ""Old Homestead"" was quite the beautiful experience. I have not stayed in the rooms so I would not be able to review the rooms. I really liked the shopping experience at Caesars."
30,I decided to go with an upgrade to The Royal Suite. Well would have been if the tv worked in the bathroom. Coffee cups would also have been nice. Had to use bathroom water glass. Shower was terrible couldn‚Äôt keep hot water. Oh well should have been better being it‚Äôs Caesars.
40,Our family stayed at Caesars Palace in early December. This is a legendary hotel that still holds up well today.    Pros: The best location on the Las Vegas strip.  Fantastic views from their rooms  Great service at the front desk with very little waiting time  Adjoining shopping mall with lots of affordable restaurants  Wayne Newton performing in a small lounge in the hotel    Cons: Room service prices are outrageous (2 hamburgers + 2 Pepsi's = $118 USD)  Swimming pool closed for the winter  Rooms are nice but need some upgrading (we stayed in the Augustus Tower)  Hotel does not provide any bath robes in the rooms    Overall we had a great family vacation in Vegas and would certainly recommend this hotel to everybody.
20,Caesars was the third hotel we stayed at during our weeklong trip and by far the most disappointing. Check in was scheduled for 4:00; our room wasn‚Äôt ready until after 5:00. This is completely unacceptable given the inflated pricing of the room food parking and basically everything else associated with the hotel.  While we were wasting and hour outside of check-in waiting for our room assignment on the terrace of the hotel we noticed a RAT; a DEAD RAT outside on top of the bushes. The rat remained there for the rest of the night until we finally went back to the room much later that evening. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. I have included a pic of the dead rat.  I gave the hotel two stars because the room in the Octavius tower was nice. Unfortunately everything else overshadowed the elegance of the room.
20,Upon arriving early we were told our room was not ready. The front desk clerk said we could pay an early check in fee of $30 to check in before 3pm disappointment one has began. We paid the fee to check into our room early because I was really tired from our 4.5 hour flight. The view was a lovely view of the parking deck this is disappointment two. I turned and looked at the bed and the sheets looked dingy and old disappointment three. I sat on the bed and there was disappointment four the bed was too firm and the pillows were so soft they just delated to limp flat piles of fabric. I walked in the bathroom and immediately I noticed old worn out wash cloths and towels disappointment five. Wait it gets better i had a fridge in my room that would not allow me to put my own food in it because it was already overflowing with items that if you move it out its spot you pay dearly for it. There was no microwave in th room either. For the amount of money paid I expected so much more from the famous Ceasar Palace especially since my room in the palace tower was an upgrade.  Overall when I pay more I expect a better experience. I picked Ceasar instead of the others because I thought I would get a luxury experience instead I just should have stayed at the Best Western and saved money because I had the same amenities. Well at least at Best Western I would have gotten a fridge I could use instead of one that was stock to the rim with overpriced drinks.
50,Great service! Friendly staff especially Suki and Michelle! They‚Äôre helpful and patient answering my questions. The room was very spacious and the strip and fountain view from the room was fantastic! Perfect!
10,I'll start with the check in process. I was promised one room and when I arrived was given a rundown room. Mind. This was my wife and i anniversary. The woman at the counter lacked customer service and was just rushing me. Then I ordered food from the food court and when i walked all the way back to my room it was the wrong order. So I didn't eat. I then was gambling and and for a cranberry juice and I was carded while at the table. Lady was pretty rude. I reached out to Ryan Bishop the director and he failed to acknowledge my issues. No follow up. When checking out I addressed this with the Diamond Check out and there blamed it on the girl that was checking us in. Saying that she was new. I'm reconsidering Caesars program for Mlife.
40,For our (family of 4 to include 2 teen daughters) first trip to Vegas we chose Caesar's Palace. This is a Fabulously beautiful hotel. There was so much to see and do. The rooms were exactly as pictured and the views were amazing.  A few things we wish we had known ahead of time:  1. There is a charge for opening the fridge even if you don't remove anything in it.  2. On the weekends the buffet is $70 PER person. $60 during the week days.    We had the pleasure of eating at Hell's Kitchen for a birthday dinner and it was worth EVERY penny! Service food decor was simply breathtaking! A must do if you are in the area. Reservations are a must as well!  The Blue Man Group show at the Luxor was phenomenal and extremely entertaining. There are NO bad seats since the theater is small.  Club Omnia in Caesar's Palace was extraordinary. Ladies wear comfortable shoes unless you get a VIP table to sit down at.
20,Room was average at best; amenities in our suite were terrible; Hallways smelled like marijuana...  Our room was not ready so they takes us into getting a room in a lower floor with a view of roof/ ac units.
20,Staying at Caesars palace right now the hotel is beautiful and we‚Äôre in the Octavius Tower in a suite. I don‚Äôt recommend this tower because it‚Äôs at the absolute furthest corner of the hotel and a very long walk from the front desk especially if you‚Äôre he doesn‚Äôt work and you have to go all the way back. Also at the special entrance for the tower there is a slot to put your key in for entrance into that tower however you don‚Äôt have to put your key in for the elevator to arrive nor do you need to put your key up to the magnet in order for it to take you to the correct floor. So in that regard Security to that tower is extremely poor. Also at the special entrance for the tower there is a slot to put your key in for entrance into that tower however you don‚Äôt have to put your key in for the elevator to arrive nor do you need to put your key up to the magnet in order for it to take you to the correct floor. So in that regard security to that tower is extremely poor.    We booked a package that included a suite and show tickets. The service has been terrible here. No one in the hotel seems to know how to help me redeem the show tickets. Spoke with concierge box office front desk manager and guest services supervisor for over an hour. No me comped is anything for our inconvenience. No one knew how to book the show tickets.  One plus is that they do serve free water and champagne in the front desk line at random times throughout the day.    Our suite was nice very large and pretty but not super clean. Sleep quality was not very good the bed is a little uncomfortable and the pillows are large and kind of hard. There were two different air-conditioning controls in the suite however we could not get it to stop blowing air unless we turned it off and therefore it made it very dry in the room. Amenities in room are lacking. There is a coffee maker but you have to pay $12 for coffee pods. There is butler service in the suite. The texted us if needed anything. No responses for hours at a time.  The bars are $$$ got a voucher for a $10 drink but the cheapest drink was $20.  Not kid friendly anywhere near the casinos at all.    The food court in the hotel has several options but we found the quality of the food to be sub par especially for the prices. We had gotten several items including tater tot‚Äôs from Smashburger pizza and garlic knots from the pizza place and tomato basil soup from the Earl of Sandwich shop. The tomato soup was fairly bland as was the sauce that came with the garlic knots. The garlic knots were good and the pizza was OK the tater tot‚Äôs not great all the food was steaming hot though which is good except when you‚Äôre in a rush. The Giada Pronto restaurant was a little bit better however super expensive the margarita pizza was OK the Panini sandwich was good the sun-dried tomato pasta was not good at all. But it was edible. Definitely better than the food court. Unfortunately we did not have time to try any of the nicer restaurants in the hotel.  I don‚Äôt think I would stay here again. I‚Äôll go back to the Bellagio or the Wynn.
50,This was my first trip to Vegas and staying at the Ceasars Palace was the best decision I‚Äôve ever made. The place is huge and has everything you need whether it‚Äôs the restaurants shopping or entertainment. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The only thing that bothered me was the resort fees of $150 and the $200 for incidentals which will be returned if no incidents. Back to the positive was the free upgrade I received for my birthday and the wine and water offered at check in. The famous Buchanan buffet is very well worth the price. You have plenty of celebrity chefs restaurants right at the resort. Despite the fees I plan to return to the Ceasars Palace in the future. You can‚Äôt beat the location in the center of it all and right next to the Bellagio!!!
40,Room was nice. Cleaning staff very friendly. We had this weird police officer safety check...    Overall hotel is nice and great places to eat. The pizza place is amazing. Very clean; however they only had one hold em table and it stayed crowded.
50,My wife and I are not exactly what you might call ‚ÄúVegas People‚Äù but we decided to get away from LA for a couple of days. A mid-week visit to Las Vegas made sense. It was far enough to be ‚Äúaway‚Äù but close enough to drive.    Caesar‚Äôs Palace exceeded our expectations. The facility is huge but arranged in easy to navigate sections. The design is very nice: large and airy. Even when teeming with people it never felt cramped.    The room was great. It was large clean and modern. Great amenities and a view of the pool. Again the floors were quiet even though the hotel has over 3000 rooms.    But the best part was the service. From parking to check-in to room service it was professional and friendly all around. Check-out was automated as well. Any issues during the stay were handled by the hotel‚Äôs text-based system eliminating being kept on hold.    Plenty of food and entertainment options made for a great time. But for us the room was so comfortable we enjoyed the peace and quiet of our own oasis.    I suggest that you enroll in the Caesar‚Äôs Rewards program before arriving at the hotel. It awards you for everything from parking to gaming and meals. Definitely worth the time. And it‚Äôs free to sign up.    I recommend Caesar‚Äôs Palace for everyone. Well done.
30,Overpriced venue to look luxurious but really lacked the quality of a luxury hotel from overpriced restaurants charming gourmet pricing with 3 star ingredients to gambling experience stretched as far as they can to be in the houses favor only to the overpriced luxury brands with little inventory of actual items most want to buy. Everything seemed unstaffed. We went to the nightclub as well and it was overcrowded by 11am. It was standing room only which concerned us about fire code and safety. I‚Äôm sure everyone loved paying $30 for a highball drink only to be confined to standing by the bar or a walkway where you have to move out of the way of traffic every other minute.
20,For the amount we paid for this hotel it could‚Äôve covered some extra things. We didn‚Äôt have slippers or bathrobes in the room which of course isn‚Äôt mandatory but would‚Äôve been nice for the amount. Everything was extremely expensive such as a $18 cocktail and $9.5 water (health hazard). The hotel restaurants had the rudest servers. The bathtub massage thing didn‚Äôt work. We could only connect two devices on the wifi for a 4 person room otherwise we would have to pay an additional $28 on top of the mandatory $45/day resort fee that was supposed to include the gym wifi and pools yet all the pools were closed for the season. No breakfast voucher or anything complimentary. Absolutely overpriced and overrated.
30,Already been here one day and I‚Äôm so sick of getting nickeled and dimed for everything. At check in I tipped the guy for a great view even though I‚Äôve paid enough for a premium room and we get a view of the roof when promised strip view. Went down and asked for higher level and ended up with a view of the freeway. Okay customer service sucks in that department. The premium room in the Augustus tower is nice with a sitting area but the convenience is totally off. Only one tv in the room and it doesn‚Äôt adjust so you can‚Äôt sit on the couch to view it only from the bed. They have a Keurig in the room but charge you $15 for the coffee....wtf!!!! They have a fridge but charge you $75 per day to use it.... so ridiculous! The closet is small but there are drawers two large ones. The bathroom in nice and the jetted tub is a bonus. Overall just meh.... I don‚Äôt think I would stay here again.  Location is good depending on your interest. There tons of shops and restaurants in the forum shops which is another plus. There is a food court with a great variety but always crowded. There are several specialty dining all of them outrageous. We did eat at Gordon Ramsey‚Äôs pub which actually was pretty good but still pricey. They have happy hour 2 to 5 weekdays not sure on weekends. You must try the beef Wellington and the short rib best I‚Äôve ever had. The toffee desert is a must.  Best advise is don‚Äôt walk save your feet and catch a ride. It‚Äôs amazing how many steps you make because these casinos are huge. Also watch your valuables and children on the street there are a lot of shady people eyeing you up and down specially at night.
50,Loved staying at Caesars we have visited many times but I had never stayed. It did not dissapoint we got great service and a nice room. Loved the products and the big fluffy towels. Will definately stay again.
50,My brother sis in law nephew and I met in Vegas for a mini family vaca. I had never stayed at Cesars always Harrahs. I was very impressed. The room was beautiful and very clean. Hotel is great. Lots of dining choices. Also its in the middle of the strip so you can walk easily to other places. There is a Keurig coffee maker in the room but you have to pay for the coffee. Theres also a Starbucks located by the elevators so coffee was not a problem. The staff is very friendly. I highly recommend Cesars Palace and will.stay there next time.
50,Caesars continues to be my favorite Vegas destination. Centrally located great staff excellent casino and restaurants - there is a lot to love. My clients demand to sit at the Galleria Bar or have a nice dinner at Hell's Kitchen. Caesars has become a tradition for my clients and family. My boys have enjoyed the multiple pools while my wife/daughter make Colors their top destination. I haven't even mentioned the forum shops nightclubs sportsbook - there is almost too much to love about this place. Its the best all around hotel / casino on the strip. We will continue to come back. If they let us back - we have won quite a few times at the casino.
40,Chasers still pays 3/2 on some of its blackjack tables. MGM properties all pay 6/5 as far as I‚Äôve found. I‚Äôll at least gamble at ceases properties if I go back. Vegas just isn‚Äôt what it used to be we like to go and gamble at atlantis in the Bahamas better than vegas!
40,During our visit to Las Vegas we explored the casino.watching Its opulent entrancefountainsroman statuesmassive columns the visitors get the feeling of being in Ancient Rome.Stroll under the changing simulated sky in forum shops.
50,My experience was wonderful cannot wait to go back. I'am looking forward to take my whole family. i told my friends about now he is looking into keeping his birthday and his 15th year anniversary party at Caesars Palace.
50,Excellent service and accommodations! Check/in went smoothly very friendly and went the extra mile to find me just the right room. Large selection of restaurants to choose from and the food was very good!!
50,Great Place! Great Food! Go! Trust Me! Go to the buffet. Walk the shops! Gamble some. Enjoy the music at the night club! Just go and experience it at least once. Yo will not regret it. Fun! Hope to go again.
30,Rae (customer service) upon check in was super helpful and she really helped us in finding the best room. The only downside is besides the resort fee you have to pay valet parking 30 dollars per day and if you park at the forum shops it is cheaper but you still have to pay. Guests should never had to pay for parking. Vegas was known for not charging parking. This is just another way if trying to make more money. Other than that we stayed at the Octavius Palace and the room is very spacious and beautiful. Carpet needs to be cleaned though because it looks dirty.
50,There is always Classy service at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. They gave us a great room with an amazing view of the Bellagio water fountains show ! They have every table and slot game you can think of and 5 star restaurants!
50,Zandra was a very helpful staff member and was able to both supply answers to our questions and help us get or room situation sorted out with very great results! Would totally want to have her help us again
50,Flamingo Las Vegas best hotel with regards to security rooms price and courteous staff. Always stayed in this hotel whenever I go to Las Vegas. Good slot machines in fact I won in one. Also watched Shania Twain concert in their sister hotel. I will come back again in April 2020 to celebrate my birthday.
50,You can be sure to have a top notch experience whenever you stay & play at any one of Caesars properties in Las Vegas. Sure there are other Hotels & Casinos and no doubt about it they are worth the trip. But for us Caesars can‚Äôt be beat great restaurants slots video poker and gaming tables. They always make us feel special.
50,The room was spacious and the buffet was excellent. Valet services was excellent and the lady Sicily was super nice and identified us when walked out to get car. I would recommend staying at the hotel. The remodeld rooms are beautiful
50,This was a spur of the moment trip. My daughter was diagnosed with an incurable eye condition and I wanted to create visual memories for her. Caesars did not drop the ball on my expectations. Thank You from My Heart to their Staff
40,Room in Octavius Tower at end of hallway facing pool. Exactly what I requested. Check in staff Princess was quick and efficient. Very helpful. Room nice size. Requested extra blanket that came in fifteen minutes. Room not cold enough. Contacted maintenance and repair person came within twenty minutes and adjusted. Much cooler now. Very responsive and friendly staff. This is a lovely hotel with well trained staff. As someone who spends more than 80 nights on the road yearly enjoyable two night stay.
50,Caesars Palace is the perfect mix of Classic Vegas and Modern Vegas. You may be rolling dice at a craps table Sinatra rolled dice at and you will head to dinner at one of the most current luxurious restaurants. Customer service is the best available the property is located at the heart of the Las Vegas strip it just can't get any better than this place.
50,The property is beautiful. Guests rooms have an amazing Jacuzzi tub. Service is quick. Check in was fast. Room was ready when I arrived. Overall great service. Reba Brooks and Dunn show was awesome. Will be back.
50,It was clean not smokier the casino was really fun to be in. We didn't have a room there. Maybe next time we are in Vegas.My husband surprised me by taking me to Vegas for my birthday. It was one of the best birthdays I've had.
30,Everything was great from locationcasino and restaurants.  The only bad thing is that the rooms are dirty and smelly. Casino attendants were very friendly and fast to pay when someone won. It has alot of choices for food.
30,Play and service normally great was not this visit. One of my favorite places on earth. Maybe next time  I think it was too crowded and smelled bad. I wish that their were more 5 cent machines instead of all these pennys that the casinos have now.
50,The hotel is extremely large and took a few days to get acclimated. Once I did it was easy. For instance there were several ways to go to your hotel room. Figuring out the easiest way took time. Short cuts etc
40,I stayed in the Julius Tower and was very pleased with the size of my room. The shower was huge! One thing I did miss was having a tv located directly across from the bed. This room had 2 TVs but both were on walls that were perpendicular to the bed.
40,very clean and well maintained. We loved the room. Be ready to do some walking. Not a surprise with cost of food and drink  high for both but not thrilled with the quality of what we purchased. GIADA PRONTO for a quick bite to take back to the room was very disappointing. CAMPBELLS soup from the can and a neighborhood deli sandwich would have been better quality and better priced. I would have to mention that some of the staff seemed a little stuffy with the attitudes.
50,From checking in to checking out and everything in between Caesars is THE PLACE to be! The restaurants are killer... do NOT skip out on experiencing Nobu or Buddy V's. These places are super delicious and the staff are ON POINT. The table games are fun and the dealers are entertaining and helpful.
50,Large hotel will all amenities. Rooms are spacious and clean. Good selection of slots and well maintained gaming areas. Night life is happing there with Omnia club and pubs and bars throughout the casino. You will enjoy your stay. Executive Casino hosts take care of their clients well.
50,Of all the Las Vegas casinos Caesars Palace still offers the best gaming experience with the best craps pit in town with the best dealers who are fast professional and friendly. They know their stuff. In the poker room the dealers are tops and this makes the game better.
50,I booked my family and friends at Caesars for a stay Dec 13-17th we had multiple rooms for a party of 12. From check-in housekeeping the overall vibe Caesars hit all the right notes. Fabian who checked us in was very knowledgeable and helped get the younger family members (all 21 and up) together in the same hallway which was very appreciated as it was their first time there. Housekeeping was excellent the rooms (2 in Augustus 3 in Palace) were like new no cigarrette smell perfectly clean and well appointed. The casino was buzzing all weekend with nice clientele and fun people. The Bachannal was excellent too for brunch. For our next family stay we will be looking to return! Thank you for a great trip. Everyone loved it.
40,Great place for both gaming and shopping as the property offers extensive opportunities for both. There's plenty of places to experience a variety of dining choices also. For photography enthusiasts Ceasar's has plenty of photo ops.
50,Everytime I stay here it gets better than the last. Dealers are friendly food is always above par. Staff is helpful the rooms are always very clean great views I wouldnt stay at any other hotel on the strip.
40,Nice big clean room comfortable bed. The service was good. Biggest draw back was available good coffee and snacks. It also would have been nice if someone would have told us or shown us map that we were connected to Paris. We didn‚Äôt discover for 2 days. But over all good hotel.
50,I have stayed multiple times at all the big name resorts in Vegas Bellagio Aria MGM Paris Mirage Venetian Palazzo Wynn Encore Cromwell Harrahs Rio etc. and Caesars. I always enjoy Caesars the most. It's perfectly located on the strip in the middle of all the action so everything is in walking distance. The hotel has a great ambiance about it the staff is very helpful and friendly and there are plenty of restaurants in the hotel or in the Forum shops. No reason to go anywhere else. I still need to stay in Nobu to check it out.
50,My wife and I stayed in the Julius Tower for three nights in December. The location to the casino was excellent elevators quick room clean and quiet (coffeemaker a big plus for us). The buffet is worth every penny. The selection is huge and the food delicious. We mainly played slots. The games were fun but we did not win on this trip.
40,Stayed in a suite in the Octavius Tower which is a bit of a walk from the check-in desk. I‚Äôll try to get a closer tower next time. Room was bright clean and comfortable. I particularly liked the spacious bathroom. Large jacuzzi tub and well lit facilities. I was surprised that there was an additional charge ($14) for the in room coffee maker cartridges. All the employees were friendly and helpful. I tried to leave a tip for the room attendant at the check-out desk but was told it had to be left in the room.
50,Always fabulous to stay at Caesars. Close to everything I like and so many restaurants nearby. Entertainment everywhere‚Äî free & shows of all kinds. The Forum Shops are worth the trip to walk around and see.
50,I never stayed at caesars palace but I alway enjoy going there for thei shops and hamming  I enjoy their buffet to it‚Äôs one of the best if not the best buffet .  I would recommend it to anyone thinking of visiting
50,Could not ask for more in terms of personal service. Attentive staff very helpful staff. Never an issues on any item. They were more than helpful even with difficult issues that were not of their creation.
50,My experience was memorable and uneventful for arrival until departure. I really appreciated the positive attitudes of the staff their friendliness and willingness to engage in conversation and show their sense of humor which is very welcoming and inviting which makes me feel welcome. I really enjoyed my stay and we be back next year on my anniversary and birthday.
50,We always stay at Caesars Palace when we go to Vegas. The location is great the restaurants are wonderful the staff is always helpful fast and professional. You can‚Äôt beat the location either. While you will probably lose money on the casino floor you‚Äôll actually enjoy doing it!
40,Good overall experience. The property is in good shape.The property can add features to improve itself. Best restaurants on the strip.Really enjoyed the concerts that Caesar‚Äôs had.Spent a total of 4 days at the property. Staff was friendly but Rewards sign up line takes too long
50,Wow this people really now their jobs! Once you arrive you'll realize they'll treat you like a Roman Emperor! Gorgeous settings great staff and great service this hotel has it all! Will definitely come back!
50,As always never disppointed about services the hotel staffs provided they are all so friendly and polite. When I played at slot the lady next to me stated the beverage girls are so nice so friendly well trained. This is my statement too.
50,Hotel staff was very friendly and professional. The room was very clean mattress on bed was too firm but still comfortable. If you are looking for an excellent hotel and good food this is the hotel for you only down side is the resorts fees.They should get rid of those ridiculous fees.
50,"At Caesars Palace I can truly say that We feel at home ""Home Sweet Home"" we feel safe at the Palace it's very clean all the employees are very friendly there are so many good restaurants and the foods are really great there are many quality shops and the amenities are endless... We go to Las Vegas often and the perfect place for us is Caesars Palace because we can find all we need there; we don't need to go elsewhere unless we have to for some especial reasons..."
50,Came to Vegas for the bf's birthday & overall it was great! We checked in early for $35 not bad considering we didnt want to walk around with our luggage for 4 hours til regular check in. Tyler at the front desk was super helpful & even upgraded our room for us! We had a designated concierge that we were able to text if we needed anything loved that. Only thing that was kinda disappointing was the resort fee it was way too cold to use the pools but I understand. Also if you're gonna take a hot shower close the bathroom door & dont let any steam out! The steam set off the fire alarm & the engineers were very kind when they checked on us but that was a first for me. The Bucchanal Buffett is great too.
50,Best hotel ever! Very clean elegant staff so nice! We will stay again! We play poker slot machines drink and have brunch and dinner there the food was delicious! 4 days went to fast I really recomend this hotel! We love it!
40,When visiting Vegas I always make it over to Caesars. It is gorgeous and iconic. The Casino always seems to be busy and fun. The property is amazing. The Forum is a definite must-see particularly if you have never been there before.  As a side note I am a foodie and a fan of gelato. Despite the abundant availability of gelato everywhere on the Strip none of it is very good...except at Caesars. They have a lemon basil gelato at Pronto by Giada which is amazing. Nothing cooler on a hot day.
50,Love Caesar Palace. Will definitely go again. Their restaurants have great selection. Gaming areas many slots. And their staff are wonderful. The Augustus tower rooms are beautiful and spacious. Overall we will visit again!
50,My check in process was fast and smooth. We were helped by Mehret and she provided us excellent service and a big smile. She also offered us a few tips about our trip. Would definitely come back because of her
40,Here for a conference and had an enjoyable time. Accommodations were good friendly staff at Caesars and excellent food and wait staff at Gordon Ramsey's. 3rd year in a row to attend the conference in Vegas.
50,Most Wonderful and compassionate staffs-    My favorite girls - SUKI AND Michelle A.    I was really pleased with our stay at the Caeser as it is a very nice hotel modern and with all the facilities needed. It is ideally situated for visiting the many sights in Rome as it is just round the corner from the station and the hop on/off on business. The staff are very good especially the Reception staff who were very friendly and helpful.
20,Housekeeping stole my AirPods i left in my room. I called back after checking out to see if they were turned in to lost and found Security informed me nothing was turned in. I work at a hotel and anything not room related left in room is turned into lost and found/security. I guess at this hotel the housekeepers like to steal items from room. Up until housekeeping stole my AirPods my stay here was pretty good.
50,It's Caesar's Palace. You can't go wrong. It has great rooms great games and has a lot of affiliate properties. The only issue I had was the pool was closed for the season. I thought that was crap. It is LAS VEGAS! Keep the pool open.
30,We had a great stay at Ceasers and would definitely stay again. I love the location of the hotel since it was close to everything we wanted to do. The only thing I was not too impressed with was the cleanliness. There were water mark of the wallpaper and stains of some sort. The ottoman and chairs in our room were stained which kind of grossed us out. We were supposedly in a newer part of the resort and it honestly did not seem like it. Overall our stay was enjoyable but if you‚Äôre worried about cleanliness just double check your room and ask for a switch.
50,I had a new restaurant for every meal and it did not matter if it was the high end dinner at Rao's or the quick bite at the Earl of Sandwich all the food was amazing. My room was immaculate with pool views and two bathrooms. The gaming floor was clean and all the servers were very attentive. Dedicated taxi lines and Uber areas if you need to get somewhere. Just a flawless experience.
50,At all times this hotel was clean and well maintained compared to the other hotels I visited on the strip. It has lots of activity and you can easily get lost trying to find which tower your hotel room is in.
50,Want to say thank you to Mr.Delano. I had reservations for a Friday night and Saturday night. I decided to stay another night and use one of my comps for Sunday night. When I arrived to Mr. Delano he made a few phone calls to to see if I quailified. Policies had changed and he nor his manager were notified on the new policy. After his calls he gets the nod to yes I quailfy but for a lower level room. Mr. Delano was apologetic about the wait from the calls necessary to get the ok for the comped room. He went out of his way to make sure I did not have to pack and switch rooms and left me in the room I already had the reservation for. For this I am grateful as I did not have to waste time to pack and move and had that extra time to spend with family.
50,It was a great stay because of the delicious food clean room and friendly hotel employees. We also had the pleasure of meeting Ralphie a hotel front desk clerk a very professional and pleasant to deal with. Thank you Ralphie and the Caesar's Palace for treating us so well and we look forward to coming back.
50,Caesar's is one of the oldest hotel/casino but it can still be rated as one of the best. The food is great the shows are out of this world especially Absinthe. The shops are fantastic. Everything is under one roof.
50,Treated with kindness and courtesy from arrival to departure. The most accommodating friendly  helpful staff to a person we have ever encountered. Management should be applauded for their ability to translate their hospitality mission throughout the organization. Room was well appointed and comfortable providing easy access to most venues of interest. Would not hesitate to recommend Caesars as destination worthy of its reputation.
50,Caesar‚Äôs Palace is the place to visit for a complete vacation and first class accommodations. Great restaurants and staff who work to please the customer. I‚Äôve stayed in many of the various towers and have never had a poor room.
50,Always a fabulous experience walking into Caesars. In addition having a great check in experience is always a treat. Mehmet welcomed me with a smile and was very engaging. Made sure I could get into my room early. Thanks for a great experience and for making sure I followed the right hall to my tower. :)
50,My beautiful bride and I had the distinct blessing of being serviced by Emma at the reception desk when we first checked in. Emma went out of her way to take care of us; she would not say no to any questions we asked. She found ways to ensure that her response was yes and she said it with a warm smile. Emma has set the standard very high for her peers to emulate!
50,This is in the middle of all the action on the strip. My family and I always enjoy our stay as we hit a number of shows and NFR at this time of year. Everyone is always very friendly and helpful.  Thjis is the first time we went to Vanderpump Bar and was pleasently surprised at how AWESOME the food was as well as the Host and waiting staff.
50,The best place to stay! Location Fantastic Rooms large Rooms clean Hotel clean. Very friendly staff! Very up beat atmosphere!! Great shopping . Down load the app! Easy check in and check out .. no waiting in lines.. Great places to eat and drink..  Love Love Love it.. 2nd time here..  If you want two bathrooms Get the Junior suite in the Palace Tower.. 760 Sq feet. Two full baths with a walk through shower and Jacuzzi tub.. Its the bomb!  Nancy
10,We only stayed 0ne night of the 3 and Caesars would not credit us. A buffet that was horrible food was bad and cost $149. for a terrible buffet with terrible food. There were 40% children they were even on the Casino floor. I'm may notify the GAMING ASSC Even our check out was terrible. NOTHING was credited and we even had to pay the guy outside 30$ more when we already paid inside. We were told we would have to go back in to the desk for credit. Caesar's did NOTHING for us. We went to the Tropicana and the rest of our trip was wonderful. WE WANT CREDIT AND WIL NEVER STAY THEIR AGAIN. If no credit we will pass the word to all our friends not to go to CAESARS.
50,We really enjoyed the room and all employees took care of our needs. The casino is lively clean and everyone very friendly. The slots are numerous and cocktail waitresses come around frequently. The casino is close to everything on the strip and so walking around is easy. We enjoy the walking and stopping at various other casinos too.
40,For a quick trip to Vegas we were able to get a decently priced although the rodeo was in town room at Bally's. Nice that this hotel is connected to the Paris property so you don't have to walk outside. Room was nice and the bed was very comfortable. Plenty of games to play between both properties. Also a lot of restaurant options. Only downside I can think of is the pushy people right off the elevator at Bally's. No! I don't want any stupid lotion. This along with the snotty people selling phone cases in the walkway to Paris. They pray on the drunk and stupid.
40,The rooms at Caesars were ok even though the double queen rooms weren't very spacious. We got to look at a white brick wall out our window. I had called 3 weeks BEFORE our trip to let them know that we were traveling with others for a total of 4 rooms and we would like to be on the same floor or at least same tower. When we got there everyone was in a different tower except the two rooms under my name. A little disappointing since I made the call and was told we could all be close to each other. Bathrooms/showers in room were nice. One of the rooms close to us had a squeaky hinge so every time they would open door (at all hours) we heard this loud squeak.
50,Great location. Great hotel. Great stay. Located on the Vegas strip with plenty of entertainment and shopping nearby. It was what you expect when staying at a Caesars property. We were just a short walk to all the other major hotels and casinos on the Vegas strip.
50,We had a great trip to Vegas and wonderful stay at Caesars Palace. Caesars registration with Allurie made things special from the start with her great service. Food and location was perfect. Highly recommend!
50,I had a great time at Caesar palace they were very helpful in getting me my room even though I arrive around noon which was 4 hours early from my check in time and there staff was very friendly and accommodating. I loss money on the tables but I had a great playing there
50,Check in was great. Was given a queen bed room instead of 2 single bed which i have requested. Immediate change by receptionist Gemma with no question ask.    Bathroom was the best. Spacious with 2 basins a jacuzzi and a shower room. Bed was equally good. Soft and comfy.    Buffet was a spread with lots of varieties.    KC
50,The hotel is like a mini oasis in the middle of everything. The service and food are top notch. I could not recommend the hotel more highly. You get priority reservations at the nobu restaurant which is a bonus as well
50,Just a quick get away to watch some NFL and bowl games at Caesars. Always a First class establishment and watched the games in assigned seats in the sports book. Dinner at Old Homestead was great as usual.
50,Housekeeping was very supportive abd accomadive and prompt on request for making my room more comfortable I must applaude the house keeping manager and ground staff for their support.looking forward to returning soon.Thanks.
50,The overall experience was fantastic we have been staying at Caesars Properties exclusively for over 40 years because it is consistently a great experience. Our room was fantastic and we always felt our business was appreciated.
50,My husband and our friends had an awesome time in Las Vegas staying at the Caesars property. Caesars is located central to walking or just a short drive to anywhere you want to go. We dined at Joes Stone Crab Restaurant which was a great experience. We took the helicopter ride over the grand canyon and went to several shows. Just an overall great time and perfect weather.
50,I am back at Caesars again because it's my favorite spot to visit when I'm away from home. I always look forward to seeing 2 people that always take care of me and take away all my stress - Michelle A in VIP registration and Ruth Bryan Casino Host. These 2 ladies I know will take care of everything for me and there is never any unwanted surprises. They are as professional as you can get. Besides being competent they are easy to talk to and always have a smile on their face and always have a couple of stories to share with me and make me feel special!
50,wonderful rooms location and staff. Would recommend to anyone planning a trip to Las Vegas. The staff is kind the location is perfect and the rooms are superb. Could not have asked for a better time!
50,Awesome experience and it was fun. The place was very well kept and clean clean clean!! Check in was slow moving but really not to bad. Heck out was very simple! Room was perfect with lots of space and great view.
50,Perfect getaway; great food and service; will definitely return soon. Forum tower location was ideal. Close to everything. No lines to check in or check out. Online check in and check out is very convenient.
50,Great food great environment great employees great reward program. I highly recommend Caesar palace to anyone who wants to be pampered and treated like king and queens.    Their reward program is the best!!!
50,Wii stayed at Caesar's palace in December of 2019 for my brother's birthday. It was a great experience everyone there was very friendly everything was clean and the buffet at the hotel was the best!!! I will recommend anyone going to Vegas to check this place out.
30,Stayed in the Augustus Tower for our last night in Vegas. Here is some of the good and bad:    Pros:  -Self check-in kiosks so you don't have to wait in line or talk to people. But you wont be able to make any special requests like getting a room on a higher floor  -The King room (strip view) had a bathtub and the bathroom was huge  -They don't put the decorative pillows on the bed. The germaphobe in me really appreciated that.    Cons:  -WiFi only free for 24 hours and for two devices. No free WiFi in this day and age especially if I'm already paying to stay here? Come on...  -No mini fridge. They only have the mini bar with the overpriced item  -TV is at weird angle. It's aimed more towards the couch/sitting area so if you want to watch from bed you'll have to look to the side (first world problems)  -You can hear the Bellagio fountain if you are on the lower floors. I was on 35 and would hear the streams of water shooting up  -Strip view rooms aren't that nice - you see the fountain Paris Cosmo and not much else interesting  -Parking isn't even free for hotel guests    Overall it wasn't a bad stay but I think I'd try out other hotels if I ever come back again. There aremt much perks to staying here.
30,Didn‚Äôt get room cleaned askd for it multiple times other than that was ok need more machines better hours for food court but overall was an great place to stay close to everything best part was giadas
50,Rooms are very nice and always clean. Unlike some hotels in Vegas the rooms are very easy to find! The staff is always friendly and helpful. We like that Caesars is centrally located on the strip. Also has really good restaurants!
50,Always helpful staff good restaurants central location. We had a large clean room more than adequate for our stay. We enjoy the variety of options and how the property is laid out. When shows are in the Colosseum it is extremely convenient. And the shopping at the Forum is great.
40,Atmosphere and rooms very good! Traffic sucks trying to get to the valet due to on going construction. Sport book excellent no line for diamond members. The book was excellent experience to watch the football games !
50,Room booked via rewards program during a very busy week. Had a great view. Service was outstanding. Casino took my money but not casinos fault. Didn‚Äôt love the food but there are plenty of restaurants available all over Las Vegas
40,In town for a few shows slots etc. Enjoyed Caesars they have a nice atmosphere. Very large casino with good varietal slots. Had an above breakfast at the All American and was surprised by the raunchy Absinthe show. It's to my liking but needlessly sexual. It was a distraction from the exception physical performance.
50,I had lunch at the Americana with my family and had very excellent service and food. I also played slots and table games. Also went shopping in the Forum. The selection of merchandise were impressive.
50,5Star.. Every part of my stau was 5 Star. The only thing the next time I buy tickest to a show I wont sit close to the stage. The theater an show was 5 STAR. I just dont like to stand when I see a show(Bad Back0 Next time upsairs front rowisle seats.
50,Great rooms with modern and refurbished rooms. Great staff. Many meal options. The Monte Cristo cigar bar is a great sports bar with outstanding people. I ate at the Old Homestead and their steaks are to die for
50,My room was in the Augustus tower with a view of the Bellagio fountains. My original comp'ed room was in the Octavius tower and spent extra for the upgrade. Well worth it with the Rodeo championships in town.
50,I stayed at the Caesars hotel for this family trip.  I had a mother's birthday during the trip and I was happy to have a special memory.  Good street view access to other hotels luxurious atmosphere in the hotel delicious buffet and friendly service
50,Room was clean and in good location buffet was excellent service was great had a great time will return again soon everybody had a great time. Hotel was in a good location valet service what's the best no waiting time for car an easy check in /check out.
30,I would like to write a report of my stay at Caesars Palace for the last year I have split my or actually stop splitting my gaming between Bellagio and Caesar‚Äôs properties to focus solely on Caesar‚Äôs because I wanted to see what the seven star experience would be like to my disappointment it was not as I expected. I called my seven Star hostess but it was difficult to get even one seven star hostess. So I I went to the hostess station in Caesars Palace. The the hostess I met was rather rude and seemed too occupied to help me understand my Seven Star promotions. For the last year I had limited my gaming to Caesars property only from previous years splitting my game in between Bellagio and Caesars Palace Las Vegas. I was excited to hear that I had made my seven star status and did not fully understand all the new benefits after being a diamond.Needless to say I‚Äôm very disappointed with how I was treated I wanted to get the suite on Las Vegas Blvd. in the Augusta tower but I was told that my play did not qualify me for a sweet like that although I even offered to pay or to book the room far in Vance and she was pretty rude about letting me know that I just didn‚Äôt qualify even though I was a seven star. so needless to say I am disappointed enough that I‚Äôm reconsidering 2020
50,What a great choose was made when we selected Caesars Palace to stay during our trip to Vegas. The hotel was very clean and staff very helpful. Great choices of restaurants and shopping. You can‚Äôt go wrong!! The gambling was spot on as well!!!
50,Our room had everything we needed it was very clean. The food selection is amazing. The casino staff are friendly and remember your name they are very efficient and rapid in attending to all your casino needs!!
50,My experience here was great with excellent services and great hygiene in the rooms. Also there are great food selections within walking distance and friendly staffs. I would recommend Ceasar palace to anyone looking for a great time in Las Vegas.
50,Great helpful and courteous staff extremely clean and luxurious room! Can't wait to go back next December for the NFR! Dining price points were as we expected.    Offered free upgraded room and it had an amazing view from the 44th floor!
40,I had a great time. I just play at Caesars Palace at Las Vegas. Beautiful place. I payed black jack the Dealer are very nice. The only problem is that they don't give enough com money for foods. AC is better for com.
40,The table dealers were very friendly and engaging. The entire feel and atmosphere was great. There are a lot of food and shopping options. Central location on the strip so there are plenty of nearby casinos within walking distance.
30,Nice hotel and casino food is good and plenty to do centrally located and can walk to many places but no perks and machines are tight! Would go back again but wouldn't pay to stay. Wish with the amount I lost in the casino I would have been offered some show tickets or some free play disappointed none of that was offered!
50,I've stayed at Caesars Palace Vegas over 50 times and the experience has been top notch regarding the customer service and accommodations. The Sportsbook fitness center (gym) and craps tables are my primary reasons for choosing this property.
10,Tons of hidden fees didn‚Äôt have our room and then the one they gave us which was a queen had leaks and got all of our stuff wet. If we had to go back to Vegas we wouldn‚Äôt stay at Caesars palace. Bad experience
40,We had a great time and the Reba and Brooks and Dunn Show was better than we expected and we knew it would be good. The room was great and very clean. The staff was helpful in every way. Just one thing I can't detracted from an otherwise great experience. My wife's allergys acted up so I stopped at one of the sundrie store in the facility and was shocked to be charged $33.00+ for a small bottle of tylenol and a small box of benedryl. Otherwise it was a great trip.
50,Our favorite Caesars Entertainment hotel. Love this hotel! We stayed in there Augustus Tower which is conveniently located but all Towers have great rooms. The Augustus does have the best showers. Rooms are always clean and well taken care of. We're checked in at the Diamond/seven Seas registration and Keli was exceptional. She was very helpful and got out vacation started out on the right foot!
50,If you want to stay and play where the action is stay here! Miracle Mile Mall is just that. Something for everyone. Las Vegas gifts food clothes theaters to entertain you and the best gaming we‚Äôve found thus far on the strip. There are great values on food and beverages so shop around. You WILL have fun here and the help is fantastic. Very service oriented and friendly.
10,So incredibly disappointed. Had an amazing dinner party last night friends from around the globe came in to visit had a wonderful dinner at Carmine‚Äôs with large Magnums of wine signed by friends. The 6 magnum wine bottles wrapped and in a Carmine‚Äôs bag in the closet thrown away by the housekeeper. Just incredibly sad.
40,Always enjoy staying at ceasers palace !!  Great food n great gambling !  Some of the best service on the Las Vegas strip !  Love the 3-2 Blackjack üëçüòé  A couple things that I don‚Äôt like is that most places on the strip chargeü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èaprox 35.00 a day for parking that‚Äôs gotta be bad for business!  Also that 35.00 a day resort fees is crazy too!! ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
50,Haven't stayed at Caesars for a bit. Tried it again because of the Reba/Brooks & Dunn concert. Couldn't have been more thrilled with the staff room restaurants check-in and check-out efficiency. Definitely will stay there again. Centralized location on the strip makes walking to other locations easy. Thanks to Caesars for a great trip!
30,The reason this got 3 is because the actual workers. We came to Caesars palace for my wife's birthday we booked December 13th thru the 15th just a few day trip. We've been to Vegas before a few times never stayed at Caesar's it's always been out of our budget well we found a good deal on the Caesar site and couldn't beat it. Normally we stay at the Excalibur and never really have a bad visit. Well we checked into Caesar's Palace and first and foremost they downsized our room they offered us an upgrade to the room we had booked for an extra 50 a night so we took it. Oh well mess up one we get to our room my wife had been working all day and I picked her up from work and we just drove up to Vegas from Kingman so she wanted to shower. She opens the shower door and it looks like it hasn't been cleaned hair literally all over the shower so we rinse it out. About 30 seconds after she gets into the shower the bulb above the shower goes out so now she's showering in the dark were kinda getting disenchanted and wishing we stayed at Excalibur. I go look at the sinks and there is toothpaste all over the counters and what looks like snot in the sink. At this point mind you we've been in our room about 30 seconds and haven't done anything aside put our bag down and my wife is trying to shower oh and now the shower isn't draining. So I call down to guest services explain to them everything and dealt with a lady who was really rude named Lori she snaps at me and goes among the lines of well the best I can do is have house keeping and maintenance come back up and I'll give you a $30 credit. I explained that's not why I was calling and she goes to bad they're on the way up. House keeping and maintenance both show up within about 10 minutes and both of those workers were EXTREMELY nice while the maintenance guy handled the shower the house keeper cleaned our whole room again(didn't ask her to). The maintenance guy shows me how the bathroom sink works with the push down drains ect then says wow these are really dirty. House keeper comes into the bathroom and cleans EVERYTHING. While she's doing that another maintenance guy comes to make sure everything is good. All 3 were super nice and professional the house keeper even pointed out that our ottoman had a stain and it needs to be swapped out so that we aren't charged she was truly amazing. We had more issues with the front desk. But the workers we dealt with we're amazing not front desk thou
20,Caesars palace is a spectacle on the strip but I was pretty disappointed in the room. The couch had visible duct tape the shower heads didn‚Äôt work and there was quite a bit of wear and tear. Would have been fine if the prices weren‚Äôt so high. In much need of a little love.
50,Just arrived home from our second stay at Caesars in 4 weeks. Thank you to Keli (our first trip) and Eric (our recent stay) in Diamond check-in. They accommodated our requests and anticipated our needs before we asked! And the LAUREL LOUNGE ....love it! Bartenders Richard and Rick know how to have a great time; the Butlers in the LL are absolutely the best! Can‚Äôt wait to return. Thank you Caesars.
30,Nice view but 78 degrees in our room without air conditioning. It broke. Outlet in bathroom doesn‚Äôt work either. We upgraded to a tower and stayed here vs lower priced hotels. Second guessing my choice.
30,Accomodations were nice. But everything else is a complete ripoff. Chargine a $125/day resort fee is a ripoff; charging $14.99 for WiFi is a ripoff. Charging $14 for  coffee pods ia a ripoff.  Find another hotel to stay in. I have been staying at Caesars since 1980. This was my last visit.
40,I stayed at Caesars Palace this week. I got a wonderful rate! The room was gorgeous. I wish I would have stay enough to use the bathtub and get room service. Absolutely no complaints. I gave it 4 stars because I was cold and it took a while for the room to warm up. It never got fully warm like I wanted it to and because I had to walk so far to my room. This really isn't something the hotel can control.
50,My girlfriend and I had a wonderful time at Caesars Palace Las Vegas! All the staff is extremely professional and welcoming. The casino is very Clean and well-maintained. We only stay at Ceasars properties now :)
50,Our room was amazing! So clean and spacious! It was easy to find and very quite! And we walked right by Starbucks to the elevators! Our view was over the pools I think 8 of them! So pretty! We loved staying here and will definitely be back!
50,Michelle A was great! Got in at 10:30 am and she went above and beyond to find me a room that was available right away! Very pleasant to deal with. Took extra time to show me on large map how to get around (the place is enormous and full of potential wrong turns! Thanks Michelle
50,Kristen Smith was very helpful in helping us find the perfect room. Service was excellent and we highly recommend this hotel. Room was amazing. We are very happy we upgraded to the suite. We will be back for sure!
10,The room was pretty beat up. They charge for EVERYTHING! Even coffee. Except toilet oaoer... but I bet they will figure out a way to charge for that too. No complementary water. Crowded.  Disney World is expensive but you get a lot more for your money.    Just not a place I like.
50,The hotel is beautiful and the pool is terrific (although it was too hot to stay out there long -- they DO NEED more umbrellas for shade). Restaurants were good especially Hell's Kitchen which was very much like the television show.    12/14/19....Back at Caesars again! Updating my review to comment on our fantastic check in experience. Jeanie at the front desk was absolutely amazing! So happy and accommodating...a real asset to the company!Made our visit special from the moment we arrived!
50,We visit Caesar‚Äôs locations several times a year but look forward to our December visit for my birthday. This year our travel plans changed and we arrived in Las Vegas a day early. We went to registration at Caesar‚Äôs Palace and while they were sold out for the evening Mehret the representative at the front desk was excellent in finding other options for our extra night. We greatly appreciate her professionalism and extra efforts to assist us.
50,Everything was super I love the Caesar Palace the rooms are very nice the staff on the casino floor are super friendly dealers are super nice. If you are looking to spend a good time in Vegas I recommend you the Caesar.
30,I have been to Vegas several times but this was the first time I stayed at Caesar‚Äôs Palace. We are from Australia & I was really looking forward to our stay there but itwasn‚Äôt as good as I hoped for. Most of the staff were lovely except for the girl at the express counter who was quite dismissive and a bit rude. Once we got to the room I was disappointed at our view which was basically the top of a building which blocked any sort of view. I called the concierge to see if there was any other room available (it was my kids first time & wanted them to have some sort of a view) and left a message to call me back but no-one ever got back to me.  There is no complimentary coffee in the room you have to pay for it. When I read the instructions to make the coffee and price ($14.00) & the fact that they instructions said a coffee from room service is the same price I decided to call room service. Room service advised that it would be 1hour & when they arrived it was actually $25.00. I hadn‚Äôt realised that there was a 10.00 service fee. So a pot of coffee (3 small cups) cost $25.00 plus a $2.00 tip!! That is about AUD 40.00. I drank every cup!  When checking my bill I also realised that they had charged 35.00 from the mini bar which we never touched. I called and they fixed this up. There were also issues with the internet.  Apart from that the room was nice big & clean. It‚Äôs a good central location on the strip also. All staff (except for the 1st lady) were lovely & helpful.  I do think they could leave complimentary coffee in the room as unless you want to pay at least $14.00 it is at least a 10 min walk downstairs.
10,I have traveled a great deal while in the military and have stayed in many hotels and this was one of the worst.  The shower drain backed up and I was standing in 4 inches of filth everyday.  The sink started backing up two days into the trip.  Wallpaper was peeling off the wall.  The furniture was falling apart as well.  Twice they tried to charge me for beverages that were not consumed.
50,Amazing service! we got checked in so fast and a couple hours earlier than our expected check in time. Our room was amazing. Our friends are staying here as well and their rooms are just as amazing as ours. Thank you for having us and thank you for the service!
30,We stayed in this property for 5 nights and found disappointment for the overall attitude of its staff most specifically the Diamond Registration and the Casino Host on duty. I'd like to commend though of the efficiency and politeness of the Valet service staff of Caesars Hotel & Casino.
50,Room was good and RAOS Always great. Gaming Tables are always great. Although they have started raising the minimum bets which has reduced my play time. Shows are good and usually have good service at shows
40,We stayed in the Octavius Tower on the 64th floor. We had a jacuzzi tub shower king bed double sink vanity couch and table and a view of the Bellagio water fountains. Lots of mirrors big closet and safe to put our valuables in. Room was in great condition. I think the mattress is a foam mattress as I kept waking up sweating all night. Foam mattresses are very HOT to sleep on.  About three light bulbs were out. We didn't bother housekeeping to replace them as there were plenty of lights. The USB port on the desk wasn't working. And the outlet on the desk wasn't working either. Fortunately I had a wall socket with USB ports on it to charge our phones. I'm not sure if the wall sockets on the wall of the room are old but the phones didn't charge very well. I had to use the charger that came with the phones one at a time.  The TV isn't that big and it kept going in and out. Pixels kept breaking up across the screen.  Since the room didn't have a refrigerator we just used a rolling cooler and kept putting ice in it. Used a Gallon plastic zip bag for the ice to keep our water and drinks cold. Bottled water in the Casino is $4.99/bottle. Went to Sprouts and stocked up on their Spring Water for $.69/bottle.  DO NOT move anything in the mini frig. It's computerized and they know the minute you've moved an item and it will show up on your bill. Review your itemized bill before you leave to dispute any items. You can take your own K-cups and brew coffee in the room without paying $13 for the coffee set. Husband used the Tequila in the mini frig to make a mix and about 2 hours later they do knock and then try to burst into your room to replace the item. Thank goodness I had the lock across the door to keep them out. I let them in to replace the bottle in the mini frig. Read on previous posts how they'll just burst into your room. You can push the privacy button or the make up room button by the door. If you leave the privacy button on they won't make up your room. And always put that sign on the door knob outside (Room is Occupied).  And YES the WiFi in room is very POOR along with the WiFi in most areas of the Resort. Standing outside to get the Uber app to work didn't work. It was hit and miss with the WiFi. I deducted one star because of the WiFi.  The worst part was when I couldn't get the Ticketmaster app to work on my phone and get into The Colosseum. Lost the first 15 minutes of the Concert. We both have new smart phones that wasn't the issue. It was the connection inside Caesars Palace. The Will Call Desk fixed my problem and printed out a ticket for me once my husband showed them the tickets on his phone. We will never do mobile tickets again.  Restaurants at Caesars are the BEST. Hell's Kitchen is overrated. Don't waste your time going there unless it's for the dessert. And naturally the Forum Shops are overpriced.
50,We stayed 4 nights at Caesars and had a very nice room. They have a good variety of slots and table games. Everything is nice and clean but very spread out. If you go plan to do a lot of walking if you want to see everything.
50,Of course the hotel and casino are huge beautiful and amazing. The restaurants are the best and the hotel rooms are elegant. There is every type of casino games and the staff are all great. We really had a fun trip.
50,Rooms very clean Beds comfortable pillows could have been a bit better  Facility top notch  Staff amazing  Offered dining was delicious.  A little confusing to find different ways from room to floor areas. Circular makes you wonder in circle at times. Makes you get to know all ways when returning to room after long days and nights.
50,It was the best resort I‚Äôve been too. Went to a concert there and it was amazing. I would recommend Ceasers to everyone. The price was a little on the high side but well worth it! The machines did not pay out though
50,Rooms were very well appointed customer service was excellent. Nobu has some great Vegan options to choose service was also excellent. Forum shops were great and were well staffed and a lot of options to choose from. Forum restaurants were also a good choice
50,The accommodations and staff at Caesars Palace are fantastic. I enjoyed every minute of my stay and the gambling was quite enjoyable. I will definitely go back to this property again and I will also refer friends and family to Caesars Palace.
40,"Always a good room and service from the maid staff. The hotel is central to the ""Strip"" and has a verity of resturants in the hotel and nearby. The gaming available and entertainment is an added benifit. One doesn't have to leave the hotel to enjoy the trip"
50,You could stay shop gamble see a show eat and never leave the property. The other Caesars properties in Vegas like Bally's Harrah'sThe Linq Horseshoe Paris Planet Hollywood Flamingo are also good places to stay and gamble.
30,Very nice hotel Casino not so good. Spread out and machines were not paying.Like to play two deck Blackjack and they only had one table and it was $200 a hand It seemed far from everything because it was so big. Felt like we were walking forever
40,It was nice just had some problems like the ac on room it should be powerful enough to make that room cold but it is not. Loved the buffet. Need a bigger sports bar it was packed and sold out seats. Slot machines tight.
50,Came to Las Vegas last week to see Reba at Caesars Coleseum and she didn't disappoint. Best show ever. !! After the show did a little gambling on the floor and won a little to pay for my trip. Overall a great trip!!!
50,First time stay at caesars it was an awesome experience. My family definitely loved the buffet. I would for sure coming back again. It would be one of my favorite hotel now at vegas. I stay at Aria a lot this was the first time try Caesars my family ended up loving it.
30,The staff are not very friendly and the room smelled awful. resort fee is ridiculous. gym is way to small for the size of the hotel. you should have free self parking like the most of the hotels on the strip.
50,Very nice and fruitful stay. Liked the staff the food the place.overall great stay. Would definitely come back soon. Very satisfied . A lot of things to do like shopping eating and just walking around
50,Great room and overall service. Room was not ready as promised had to wait almost two hours and miss an afternoon appointment. This should never happen at a Hotel like this!! I suggest Ceasers stop making promises it can nor keep.
50,This hotel has everything! Great dealers amazing rooms and especially their newly remodeled showers the casino has a great game betting zone and you can find all of the food you would ever want! The buffet was delicious and the Smash Burgers in the cafeteria area was great late night!
50,Me and My Wife got here for early check-in and from Valet to the Check-In desk was excellent service. Smooth and Promot with No issues! When you coming 3000 miles to visit that‚Äôs always comforting! Zandra the Front Desk Clerk was great and very informative. She gave us a great layout of the Hotel/Resort and let us know extra information just in case we decided to make other moves. THANKS!
40,The stay was good they ensured I don't have to move rooms between 2 different rooms for my 2 reservations. Good benefit as diamond member. Used some of benefits get free shows and enjoyed the celebration dinner.
50,Amazing Spacious rooms & an Amazing selection of restaurants to choose from. The attention to detail at Caesars Palace is second to no one. I would highly recommend Caesars Palace to anyone visiting Las Vegas.
50,The stay was wonderful. The conseour staff was very helpful. The room was nicely designed and comfortable.I was not thrilled with the no room service option  we tried it but will never take the option again.
40,Unexpectedly had a room ‚Äúdowngrade‚Äù upon check-in after several months of reservation. No solution was provided as all of Caesar‚Äôs was ‚Äúfully booked‚Äù. Otherwise a pleasurable experience and will likely return.
40,my room was 2757. the toilet paper was a major issue It felt like sandpaper The wait for a drink in the  sports bbok took way to long at the bar. more service needs to take place at the chairs in front of tv's  in the sportsbook.
50,Prime location on the strip. Nice clean rooms. Plenty to do at this property. Great entertainment. Good choices on food and restaurants. I do wish that they would offer a few more lower stack table games.
30,Room was not clean and the service was not great especially in the sports book. The parking was out of control it took us 4 hours to find a parking space . We waited in my car for four hours and no one apologies or said anything.
50,Food was excellent at all restaurants... great shopping and quick drink orders. We can‚Äôt wait to gob back so much to see! Lovely Christmas decorations were up!! Service was excellent !!!!!! Epic trip!!
40,Our room as Caesars exceeded our expectations. It was large and recently renovated in 2017 we were told. Self-parking was somewhat difficult to find - you have to go around behind the building and it was a long walk and challenge to find the registration desk from the parking ramp having never been there before. At registration the staff member we spoke with was very friendly and helpful. The casino was busy most days but I think they pretty much all are on the strip. We would have like to see more variety of slot machines too but we still had a great time here.
50,Great experience. Have been to Caesars Palace several times over the years. Staff interactions are more friendly and helpful than a few years ago rooms are clean and well appointed and enjoy the gym and Spa.
50,Caesars Palace is an excellent resort. There is a lot to do that‚Äôs beyond gambling. The restaurants are wonderful and eclectic the fitness club is excellent and the shopping is incredible. The facility is clean and safe and it is located on a great part of the Las Vegas strip.
50,This casino has always been very clean and nice. The employees are very helpful friendly and kind. I would suggest to anyone going to Las Vegas to stay here and spend the vast majority of your time here.
50,Very enjoyable trip Staff at Ceasars was very accomodating. They guys that stored our golf clubs had them out and ready the two days that we played golf. The lady at Concierge was very nice and printed boarding passes for us. The service at Ceasars exceeds anything we've experienced at any of the other hotels/casinos in Vegas.
50,Despite the crowds because of the National Finals Rodeo every part of the hotel/casino were clean and beautiful. My room was spotless. I was able to relax and enjoy my stay. The choice of eating establishments is unbelievable. My favorite was Ramsey‚Äôs Pub and Grill. Best fish and chips I have ever had.
50,Listen very carefully at the front desk check-in about housekeeping services. Front Desk talked about an offer of receiving $10 off your bill at the restaurants if you declined daily housekeeping service. We never intended on not having housekeeping clean the room daily. Housekeeping did not clean our room once during our 3 day stay and we never received a discount at the restaurants.  Very poor communication upon arrival and no follow through.
40,The rooms were clean pretty good food options wonderful staff for most part very good location on the strip close proximity to other attractions in Las Vegas average gaming options no real complaints.
40,Ceasar worker were helpful and kind. Took a little long to get our room but it was clean. We ordered room service and was great alot of food but a little bit pricey but over all it was good experience.
30,Our room was so far from anything it was like walking a mile to get to a door or elevator and pools were closed for the season. Shower leaked. The beds are fabulous. Steakhouse is amazing but expensive. Breakfast buffet is excellent but expensive but costs just as much if you go to the small cafe there.
50,Amazing time good food drinks beautiful scenery and women. We stayed at the Rio but visited all the surrounding hotels and casinos and it was awesome from start to fininzb highly recxoment to anyone thinking of visiting vegas
50,Omia club are great  We had a good time when ever we are at Caesars Palace  Nobu restaurants are my favorite  Their sushi are the best sushi ever  Services are excellent too  Yes I will recommend this 5 * to everyone
50,5th trip to Vegas and first time staying at Ceasar . I will never stay anyway else. Employees were awesome and helpful. Room was amazingly clean and the bathroom was so spacious. Didn't win but we had one hell of a time.
40,The overall experience was good but being charged for small details was aggravating. Instead they should charge more and include coffee and water. Mini bar is sensored to trigger charges if items are moved
40,The hotel is luxurious clean and convenient. Restaurants are good with great variety. Only complaint was recurrent problems with valet. No clear directions or conflicting instructions based on time of day. Employees were unengaged to downright nasty at the first area of contact! Bad first impression. Bell hops made up for it by being nice. Had challenge getting room cleaned but resolved. Ivy saved the day more than once. Be warned coffee service costs $14 for 4 pods. Bring your own!
50,Arrive at a clean well lighted entrance into a wide open lobby with multiple employees asking if they can help you. The entire time there the staff was very attentive whether it was in regard to the stay or the games you wanted to play or sports you wanted to place a wager on.  Will definitely stay here our next trip.
50,Nice clean casino. I had the opportunity to play and had some good luck. Plenty of options in gaming. It is pretty large and sometimes you can get a little lost trying to find your way around the property.
50,Caesars has everything! You would never have to leave to experience a great time! The gambling shopping and food is all under one roof! I highly recommend this place! I already plan on going back soon!
50,I only came and gambled I did not stay on the property. My wife and her friends attended a Reba and Brooks and Dunn concert which they loved and bragged on. The Collesium experience was something that they want to experience again.
50,Got here early one morning Delano at the reception desk took care of me and got me on my way after a horrendous red-eye flight to LV. I know it cost $30 to get my room early but worth it so I could shower before breakfast.
40,Went to see Wayne Newton and thoroughly enjoyed the show. I had no idea how much talent this man has as I watched some video of his life i learned he could play 13 instruments - I don;t know of anyone else who could do that. But his story was great and he was truly blessed in his career over the years. He sang a song to me and held my hand as he sang. I cried. Thank you Wayne for a special birthday treat and for your service to our men in the military and may God continue to Bless you.  Janet M.
40,We arrived on Thanksgiving day check-in was superfast we did not get told of any offers for food shows or summary of hotel. We had booked rooms in julius tower which is not far from the reception. As standard in Vegas you walk through the casino to the bedrooms. The casino needs a better ventilation system as its smoggy with cigarette smoke and the smell is yukky. The elevators have pass Fobs but you did not need to place your key on the fob for the elevator to move so anyone off the street can simpy walk up tp the rooms. I also did not see any form of security near or by the elevtors but security in the casino were visible. We stayed on the 8th Floor room 877  plesently when you come out of elevator the air is clean and fresh the hallway clean and our rooms were clean & smelt lovely. The rooms are big good size toiletries standard big shower . The bed was very comfortable and queen size we were pleased the room looked like the picture on the website. We did a tour of the hotel and visited their onsite nigtclub Omnia was free for guests if you produce your room card and your i.d staff there very friendly. The collesum is also within the hotel grounds and has its own food court so we used this instead of any room service. Room service menu does not have any prices listed but there is $10 dining cgarge 18% gratuity plus tax will be added to your bill. Centrally located across the road from the linq and next to bellagio and miracle mile shops so very very good location.
30,Caesars is a nice place but HUGE! Be prepared for that. Also paid for early check in (a fee) and didn‚Äôt get it. Had to talk to customer service about refunding the fee. The waitresses were great at the resort. Tables are high minimums. You will get more bang for your buck elsewhere in my opinion.
50,This place stands the test of time. One of my favorite places and the sportsbook is awesome. Get a seat at the circle bar and play the ponies and watch sports all day! Always good service and just one of my favorite places to go anywhere in the U.S.
40,Nice king room#5730 it had a small view of the strip lights bed comfy coffee maker but it never worked and the coffee was $14. Parking was $18 even with our stay here. Nice employees. For a breakfast plan on $40 and up for 2 same with lunch.
50,My room was beautiful It was large and had the most comfortable bed. I wasn't crazy about the long walk to the tower I was staying in (Palace Tower). The view was nice the large tub was great. Outside of the bathroom there was a vanity with a lighted makeup mirror which I used.
40,I loved it here. We were here for the Marine Corps Ball and got a deal on our room. We just got a basic room but then they sent me an email to upgrade for $44 a night. So glad we did! Our room was over 700 sqft and had 2 bathrooms a 2 person shower a beday a huge whirlpool tub... The room was huge and clean. We had a great view of the city. Everything in the hotel was beautifully decorated and there were so many options for things to eat and do. My one complaint was that I kept getting lost because it is so huge. But that meant there was more stuff to do so is that really a complaint? I don't know. Anyway I loved it! My new favorite place to stay in Vegas.
40,I brought 7vpeople to your resort for my 50th birthday. Room was very clean. We reserved a king palace room to find out there was no guarantee. It was in the fine print he said. Very disappointing since I reserved it months ago.
50,Room was spacious bed was very comfortable. Dealers and servers were pleasant and accommodating. Service at dinner was excellent - courses came our timely so everything was  hot and attentive to refills and generally happy people.
20,Rooms are not so great and very costly and they are looking for a chance to charge you. I requested to extended Checkout for 30 min instead of 11am but they denied after 9 days of stay which made to pack and checkout in 10 mins. Overall bad experience for me.
50,Like always ceasers palace did not disappoint......  Service was top notch...  Food was great...  Brooks and dunn and reba macintyre was the best.....  If you go to vegas for a concert...  Make sure you go to see reba and brooks and dunn....
50,I've stayed Excalibur Flamingo MGM Bellagio and Ceasars was my favorite by far. First class clean just a pleasure to stay here. Great restaurants. Great staff always very helpful if you need something. I will go here from know on.
50,Arrived at Caesars on Tuesday December 3rd was happy to escape the cold and snow of NYC!    Arrived at Caesars Palace and met with Patrick at the front desk! He was so nice so professional and super helpful! After taking such an early flight with very little sleep he was able to get us suite room 6406 to be exact without any trouble! Thank you Patrick you were truly wonderful!    Caesars has so many wonderful places to eat. We enjoyed Rao's for an wonderful Italian meal. Russ our server was extremely down to earth and really made us feel welcomed! Thank you Russ!    We ate at Gordon Ramsay's English Pub twice. Once was lunch and the other was dinner. The servers were terrific and accommodating even though it was extremely busy!    All the staff at Caesars are super attentive whether it be housekeeping the front desk a bartender server cocktail waitress or security they all deserve five stars as they are all friendly and totally professional!    Since we returned we have decided to make Vegas one of our yearly vacations. We would not hesitate to return to Caesars as everything was wonderful!    See you in 2020!    Rose Molloy and Tim DeMarco  Brooklyn NY
50,Been fortunate to stay at most of the üè® in Vegas .. by far my favorite is  Caesars Palace because of the nice rooms-great restaurants ( Raos & Homestead mmmm good ) & awesome staff ... especially in the Diamond Chex-in ..  The whole staff always makes me feel welcome . Michelle A & Susan always go the extra steps to try and get me into my room request with efficiency & a smile üòä.  It‚Äôs much appreciated !
40,We have visited Las Vegas a few times but it was our first stay at Caesars. The service when we arrived was very efficient and friendly. Our room was beautiful spacious and very comfortable. The hotel itself is beautiful and iconic. Where I have a problem with this hotel and I wanted to grade it even lower but because everything else was superb I gave it a higher rating. Anyway for a hotel like this that advertises free wifi in the room never once said it was limited to 2 devices and after that you have to pay We just spent 5 weeks on the road in hotels ranging from grand to average and this was the only hotel to charge extra. I know there are others that do this but don‚Äôt advertise free wifi in the room. The other thing was the fridge in the room. The are jam packed with hotel drinks with no room to place anything in there of your own. They have even gone as far as placing sensors in the fridge that show if you removed anything and replaced it back later. We like to chill water each night for our hikes each day but certain not in this room. Or even put some milk in the fridge for tea and coffee. I have stayed in a number of hotels in Las Vegas on the strip and even downtown but this is the first place I have said I wouldn‚Äôt return to. I won‚Äôt stay in a place that makes my needs seconds to their profits so blatantly. I‚Äôm all for making money but don‚Äôt be so cheap about it when everything else is spot on and you have gone to every expense to make it that way.
30,"We stayed at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Booked a room in the ""Laurel"" collection of rooms due to the fact that it was supposedly updated from basic Forum collection. It was in the Octavius tower. We were happy with the room (king size bed nice sized bathroom) but the hotel itself is a little dated. We had a nice view of the strip and view of the fountains at the Bellagio but other than that it was dated. Room was really not that clean; hair (not my color) was found on table and desk and one of the towels in the room looked like it was used (lipstick/hair). Restaurants in hotel were ""okay"" and I can't say that I would rave about anyone in particular. We walked up and down the strip and after going into various hotels I think my next stay would be in the Cosmopolitan. It seemed updated and modern. We loved the ""Chandelier"" bar in the middle of the Cosmopolitan (great drinks) and there is a hidden pizza place that had good pizza (and I am a New Yorker!). The only saving grace about staying at Caesars Palace was the night before we left we hit it big on the slot machines and actually left Vegas with MONEY!"
50,Staff are friendly and restaurants are all good. The shopping in forum is awesome with all the high label brand. The palace tower is spacious and the room is clean and beautiful. We had a great time . It was a memorable birthday celebration with my cousins.
30,Having stayed at a few places in Vegas over the years we decided to take advantage of some cheaper prices over Thanksgiving holiday. Caesar's is a great place for window shopping people watching and viewing of the amazing replicas of Roman architecture. Our room was in the Augustus Tower and we did have a great view of the mountains and the strip. While the room appeared clean we moved a couple of chairs around and found they had not cleaned under them. I am picky about my pillows at a hotel and these were some of the worst ever - compacted down of some sort very hard and uncomfortable. The location of Caesar's is central to many other casinos which is good but it's not on the monorail side which we use regularly when we visit. There are many restaurants and bars inside the complex with a range of prices and cuisines. The food court has some tasty options for a quick bite and we had one breakfast at the Cafe Americano ($70 for a couple of basic omelettes and coffee) but did not try the other restaurants during this trip as we like other food choices better that are off property. Since it was Thanksgiving holiday we thought about checking out the buffet but the line every day for lunch or dinner looked like a 2-3 hour wait to get in so we skipped that. Like many other hotels there's a daily $30 charge for valet parking and separate $45 resort fee that only includes 2 wifi connections per day.
50,It was a great stay my host was Number -1 bar none Marie Tabet and  The service was excellent as I have mentioned before I‚Äôm the first to to complement when I receive Amazing service and a magnificent week with all the Caesar‚Äôs from the the time  We walk in to the properties looking forward  For our next stay
50,I visited the Bacchanal Buffet in Caesar's Palace and I was pleasantly surprised that I did not have a long wait to get into the buffet and I did not experience long lines to get the food. The seafood offerings were fantastic and I really enjoyed the King Crab legs. The servers were very attentive to our table and helped make our dining experience even better.
50,First time to stay at Caesars! Great location room and service especially considering how crowded Vegas was for the AWS event and the NFR. Highly recommend! Even had great luck at their blackjack tables.
20,This review is about an over the phone experience I had with a manager by the name of Allison 3 days after checking out. I was promised (face to face) that a fee would be taken off due to a mistake that the hotel made. The fee was never taken off. Allison explained to me that there was no note left in the reservation about it so she could not remove it. I explained to her the whole situation and multiple conversations I had with the front desk and how ridiculous it is that they couldn‚Äôt honor what was promised due to an internal error and lack of communication. Allison was silent for 30 seconds then very rudely said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take that charge off for you then.‚Äù I said ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù Then she hung up on me without any type of closing of the phone call not a single word just hung up on a guest that spent nearly $1000 for one night. I am appalled at the customer service of this location definitely not ‚Äúimpeccable service‚Äù or ‚Äúluxury‚Äù as advertised.  Call: 8/28/2019. Ended time 11:03 AM.
50,We has a great experience! We were treated like royalty! From the minute we were greeted by Chuck to being served drinks by Rick and Richard...The laurel lounge is our go to place whenever we are in Las Vegas!
50,great place to stay and also great food service coffee is great! I would recommend to all my friends and family. The beds and pillows are very comfortable. The room was clean and the housekeeping was good.
50,We didn't stay at the hotel as we were only there for the Mariah Carey All I Want for Christmas show. The show was absolutely the greatest and the service for drinks while we waited for the show was absolutely awesome.
40,great room easy access to everythingfood at the restaurants was good the slot workers were prompt. if you had a problemvalet was fast and easy to use was refused access to the diamond lounge because i was lacking a few points my points was 24800 
30,we always enjoy our stay at Cesar we liked to go spend time at the casino  And also we like few of the dining areas  But the only problem we always have is when we call to get our complementary rooms we always get rejected 4 to 3 times and we keep hanging up and calling again till the right person pick up the phone and give us our rooms
50,Stayed in Palace tower suite. Elevator access to conference floors was really convenient. Room very clean walk in shower great. Only nit was bed to soft for my liking. Had fun gambling at blackjack and craps tables forum restaurants very good.
50,Very great experience I love this casino I‚Äôm definitely coming back with family and friends can‚Äôt wait to come back for the experience most would say how they think casinos is here to milk you out of your money I beg to differ it‚Äôs always a good filling when you come to a place that helps your money work for you I just need to know the method in setting up my awards account so that I can rep the full benefits of this beautiful establishment.
50,Stayed in the palace tower suite and it was very nice. The Casino had only two blackjack tables for $15 while the rest were $25+ minimum bet and the craps tables started at $25 minimum. I played the $15 blackjack table but went to another casino to play craps at a $10 table. So I give the hotel an excellent and a poor to the casino for not accommodating all financial levels for gambling. Food is outrageously expensive.
30,The staff was professional and very helpful. My room did not feel clean. When I first stepped in the room and closed the curtains I stepped on a soft cookie on the carpet. There was no hairdryer although I asked for one and got one right away. I was charged over $100 in mini bar expenses of which I used none. I complained and the charges were taken off the bill. It was really difficult for the shuttle to park to pick me up because of all the Ubers blocking the way. We dined only once in the Americana Cafe and the food was poor and expensive.
50,Great accommodations restaurants and gaming opportunities. Buffet is expensive but worth it something for everyone. Numerous entertainment opportunities and the location of Caesars is ideal - connected to a wonderful mall.
50,Had a great time and lots of fun. A little far from my room but was ok. Good exercise and the food was great too! Love your new slot machines. Oh and the jacuzzi was so relaxing and wonderful. Hope to be there again next year
50,We loved our stay. Everyone was very helpful and polite. The place was amazing and I cannot wait to go again. This was a birthday surprise for my wife to see Reba/Brooks and Dunn. The concierge (Ivy) was awesome I. Helping me set up Limo Service and Spa treatment for my wife.
40,You never have to leave if you don't want to. Everything available here. Buffet was pricey but awesome. Starbucks was pricey but convenient.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Rooms were great and extremely clean. Overall very happy with our stay
50,We had a great time on our trip to the Caesars Palace. Our host got us a great room without any issues as well as tickets to the Mariah Carrey concert. It would have been a better trip if we had won a few bucks but I can't complain.
50,Beautiful clean rooms. Lots to see and great places to eat. Great location. Our family spent the Thanksgiving holiday at Cesar and we all had a great time at those casino hotel. Beautiful place to visit with
50,When we arrived at Caesars to check in We were greeted with a smile. We had opted for the early check in and was not disappointed. They had a room ready for us in no time We stayed in the octavious tower. Beautiful room check out was super easy. Checked out on the tv in our room. We will definitely be back
50,This place is awesome. It could be a museum with all the grand statues and art work. Every employee we encountered was on a mission to provide excelent customer service. We even won some money bonus.
50,The room had a great view . Very roomy and clean good location on the strip. This was my first time staying at Caesars Palace and I will stay there again in the near future . Will also tell my friends about my experience at Caesars Palace
50,Caesars Palace is a great place has great Vineyards and it has great clubs and it has great artwork to look at just a magnificent place. Can't wait till the next time that I have the opportunity to visit Caesars Palace is always a pleasure and I think them so much from their employees to there gas to everyone they are truly in good spirits.
30,I had an old ticket for $91 Caesars said it is impossible to pay me even though I clunked $4000 or so at their casino. The room was nice and otherwise the employees were helpful and professional.  Bad karma.
40,The room was very nice. Excellent location to see the other casinos and attractions. We had a good time with family with only being there for one night. If you have free play offers make sure to read the small print on receiving the offer.
50,I didn't stay at Caesars but i like to play and eat there. its always fun to play there. employees are always nice and polite good atmosphere. Im looking forward to go back there.    Ramiro Rodriguez
50,We have been treated very well. The place is clean and well organized. We even got a free upgrade. Staff is very polite. Have reservations at Hell‚Äôs Kitchen. So far we are enjoying our stay very much.
50,The spa is fabulous. We really love Gordon Ramsey's fish and chips and his salads are the bomb! We also very much enjoyed the Mariah Carey concert venue. The room is great; the seats are comfortable and the sound could not be beat. The seats are elevated so you can always see the stage even if peope stand up in from of you.
40,Room was clean and comfortable. Meals were excellent. Interaction with casino host was excellent.  Sports center were very good. Gaming room was clean. Lots of shows were very good and enjoyable. Enjoyed the gym and spa.
50,Caesars is topnotch. Food and gaming is amazing. If your going to Las Vegas go to Caesars. Everyone is helpful. Had great meals and a great time. I'll being going back again for a great time and vacation
50,Good I‚Äôm like stay in Caesars Place if next time I go I can get the rooms with good view and bigger room my friends are like the buffet and the food we are enjoyed all the games and the slots Machines
50,Our particular room could have been better but overall it was nice. The resort is huge and you do not have to leave for anything unless you actually wanted to. The food was excellent if not just a little over priced.
50,Caesars it still the best old school but updated place to stay on the strip. Freindly staff in all areas of hotel. Never had a bad time staying here. Great location on the strip to walk around town and exsplore.
50,Spent 6 days at Caesar‚Äôs Palace. Very clean room üíû Our bed was huge and sooooo comfy. Enjoyed the casino waitresses were attentive. Won quite a bit of money. Nearly a thousand dollars for 75 dollar stake on the poker table. All staff were friendly. Rod Stewart was fab. Grand Canyon helicopter ride was the icing on the cake. All in all a fantastic experience Trip of a lifetime. Hope to return again one day x Thank you all üíû
30,Caesars continues to have problems when you arrive at the hotel with checking into the rooms your reserve prior to your trip. When you arrive at the hotel it takes over an hour to secure your room and when you do it seems like they go out of their way to give you the worst room in the place so that you must argue your way to a better room every time. This is not a one time occurrence and it seems to only happen at Caesars Palace what is the problem?
50,I didn‚Äôt stay the night at Caesar‚Äôs but the hotel and restaurants were great and food was great variety and the atmosphere was very nice the casino itself was so beautiful words wouldn‚Äôt explain when you walk in their it‚Äôs stands to its name a palace.
40,Over our experience was good. If you are booked in the forum tower be prepared to walk a long way from checking in to the hotel to getting to your room. You have to walk through the Casino with you luggage in tow and believe me it is a long way.  Our suite was Hugh! It was a 1 bedroom with private large bathroom and bedroom. It also had a guest half bath for your friends to use if they came up to your room.  The furniture was really outdated suite was not updated at all but it was very clean and quite. We stayed in room 5606.. housekeeping kept the room spotless and did great job the last day we where there housekeeping never showed up that day and we checked out at 7:30 that night so I was confused why no one came in.. really wanted to take a few last minute pictures of our suite but bed and bath ended cleaning so I didn‚Äôt take any pics.  Casino floor was nice but table games where expensive Very few $5.00 tables mostly $15 and up..  so if I was playing 3 card poker that was $45.00 per play and iifff. I added bonus that was another 5and then the progressive was another 5 I ended up having $55.00 dollars on the table.. WOW.  I ended up playing at Harrahs across the street and they had $5:00 tables. Much better for my pocket book. All and all Caesars was ok just not the table games. Slots were very tight didn‚Äôt see anyone winning much but of course they don‚Äôt want you too LOL
50,Housekeeping was great no problem with bring towels gave great direction the hotel was very clean the weather was okay my kids and grandchildren had a great time I'm ready to come back this month . I'm going to call and make reservations for the 17th
50,I came here for my birthday and it couldn't have been a better idea...I loved everything from the gelato down to the pub grill Gordan Ramsey...I love this place I can't wait to visit again next year..
40,The hotel service is excellent. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. The rooms were a little worn considering I was told they were recently remodeled but they were very comfortable. I still prefer the location of the flamingo.
50,Love Ceasars! Always a wonderful time there. Restaurants fab too! We ate at the Asian one and it was superb. Waiter was super cute too! They‚Äôve changed things up a bit since I‚Äôve been there but all for the better. It‚Äôs old school and new school which I like most. The Cmas decorations were wonderful!
40,The facility was really nice and well decorated. The food was really good at the Hells Kitchen facitlity. The Christmas decorations were worth seeing. The casino staff was very friendly and helpful. The facility felt very safe and inviting.
50,The room is big and clean. Even I don't have a view in my room I'm very satisfied on my stayed last month.On my next visit I will ask for a couch in the room it's hard when there is no sitting area in the room
50,The rooms are beautiful the casino is always filled with happy people enjoying life and having a great time. There are great restaurants located inside the casino as well! We have been staying at Caesars for over twenty years!
40,a very good selection games to play. Friendly staff  food choices were great enjoyed the steak house well i was there. the views from the rooms are wonderful on one side you see the strip the other you see the fountians.
50,We love staying at Caesars Palace because of the convience of where it is located on Las Vegas strip and for the great restaurants wonderful casino and club atmosphere cleanliness of suites and helpfulness of guest services
50,Richard in the Diamond Lounge is the best! In fact he's part of the reason I keep my status...so I can visit him in the diamond lounge. Keep up the good work! Been coming to the diamond lounge since it opened in 2006. So I remember when Richard first started in 2007. Like a fine wine he's only gotten better with age.
50,I have played for many years at all properties on the strip and have had players cards to all properties. The last four years Ceasars properties has become my home. I am a seven stars player and my number one reason for making Caesars my casino of choice is the employees. There are so many great employees I wish I could name them all. The Diamond Lounge staff is like my Cheers. They make you feel like family. I have developed so many great friendships. Richard and Rick always make the trip fun. There are trips I come mainly to hang out in the Diamond Lounge. I hope they never take this perk away    Doug Bennett
50,Visited the Diamond Lounge and Richard was beyond great! He was attentive fun personable and always kept the drinks full! It was a great experience. The Diamond Lounge itself is also great with lots of food options.
50,I‚Äôve been coming to Caesar‚Äôs Palace for over 10 years and absolutely love it. One of the big perks is the Laurel Lounge (formally Diamond Lounge). Richard and Rick are the best bartenders hands down. They make all the players feel valued and take extremely good care of us all. Many of us play as much as we do just to come into the Lounge. Caesar‚Äôs-hope you take great care of these employees. They are a huge reason why we all come all the time. There are many choices of where to spend your money on the strip and this club makes it all worth while. Thank you Richard and Rick!
50,We come to Caesars quite often and one of our favorite things to do is visit the Laurel Lounge and see Richard and Rick. They‚Äô always take very good care of us and always make it a fun time! They get our spirits up and get us out to play
50,We‚Äôve been coming to Caesars Palace for a number of years and our very favorite part of any trip is our visit to the Laurel Lounge! We deliberately keep our Seven Stats status each year so we have this perk. Richard and Rick and the entire staff make it so much fun- we will not miss it. So many laughs gambling stories and fun times!!! We have even made some life long friendships from the lounge. And not to mention we enjoy the yummy drinks and food! Thank you for this awesome perk- highest rating possible!
50,Absolutely loved every aspect of Caesars Palace. Everything from the room food shows gaming everything was top notch. Staff was great we felt like we were in an adult Disneyland!! Next trip will be when it's warm because the outdoor pool is awesome!!
30,"For the outrageous resort fee the pool wasn't open for use. You had to pay extra for coffee in the AM. Bring your own K-cups! Room was ""upgraded"" at the counter. Was not able to check in via the kiosk (the kiosk kept telling me the room wasn't ready) so I went to the counter and Daniel was able to find a room right away. Probably wouldn't stay here again. Hand print (easily able to wipe off with a washcloth) on the bathroom door as well as lipstick stains on the counters (not my makeup by the way)"
50,Had a wonderful suite in the Julius tower. It even had a special elevator. Booked to see Reba with Brooks and Dunn. Exceptional Show. Slots were fun too. The staff were all exceptional. Ate dinner at the buffet that had the most varied and delicious offerings. Packed alot into a 1 night stay.
30,The rooms were clean and spacious. I asked for a room with a view on a lower level. I called and verified I could get a room on a lower level with a veiw. When we arrived they said the lowest level with a view was the 16th floor. That is NOT a lower level.
50,A big deciding factor in our stay over the last several years has been the Diamond Lounge at Caesar‚Äôs specifically Richard and Rick being the best bartenders on the planet! They make our time here 10x more enjoyable!
50,"My stay at Ceasers was the highlight of my Vegas trip. The staff was very polite and professional. The hotel was a wonderful place  so clean and fresh smelling .....one word to describe Ceasers is ""Outstanding"" !!"
40,Great bed pillow and room. The casino was very Smokey on this trip. The restaurants were really good. My casino host is always great. Great view from our room. The Christmas concert we attended was beautiful and the colosseum is awesome.
50,Love everything about Caesars! Rooms are great many eating options amazing service centrally located on strip. Many option if you are a player including so many slot machines. My go to place every time I want to go to Vegas. Other Caesars locations are also great.
50,I did not have the opportunity to stay in the hotel. I only visited the casino and spent time gambling and also went into a couple of the bars. I would love to stay at the Caesars palace location during my next visit.
50,We love to stop at the Laurel Lounge with Richard and Rich manning the bar.  Comped drinks with appetizers hot food & a welcoming bar staff is what brings us back  time and time again.  When we stay at a MGM property no matter how nice it might be we miss  The Laurel Lounges. So we keep finding ourselves returning to Caesars properties.  We hope the new owners understand the real edge Caesars has in customer loyalty  and satisfaction with their Laurel Lounges.
50,My experience at Caesars Palace was outstanding as it always is. The Forum Shops are the best because they offer a great variety of restaurants shops and scenery. The staff at Caesars Palace provides outstanding service and very knowledgeable about the property and the happenings throughout their other properties.
50,Great room. Little bit of a walk from the casino but an excellent value. Lots of great places to eat and drink on the property. Convenient location to other attractions on the strip. Will definitely visit again.
50,From check in to check out we loved our stay at Ceasar's Palace. We ate shopped and played many of the tables and slots. I would highly recommend staying here at Ceasars to anyone looking for a fantastic experience and a great location on the strip. I can't say enough about our room. We overlooked the fountains of the Bellagio right next door.
50,Big clean classy rooms. All the newest slot machines. Great shows and the forum shops means we don't have to leave the property to have a blast. Food court is good Omnia night club is awesome and one of my favorite sports books.
50,Great experience at ceaser. Restaurants and food court very convenient. Casino with great waitresses friendly and great service shopping is great all different high end stores. Great place to shop dine and play .
20,I noticed that the express check-in/out kiosks were not working. My first hotel key that the front desk provided also did not work. The toilet in my bathroom made a sound as if it was continuously being flushed. And to continue the above stated theme the telephone in my room did not work. However the hotel staff were very attentive and good about making my stay pleasant.
50,My brother turned 50 and uncertain where to celebrate. We picked Vegas and to celebrate like a King - Caesar‚Äôs It was !!!  Room was clean and bed is so comfortable . Mom who had insomnia was able to get a great sleep .
50,Rooms are clean and specious. You have everything in need in the room except the coffee machine is K-cup ones. And the room provides a package of K-cup coffee but is charged to you. So if you want to enjoy a morning coffee you may bring your own k-cups. Other than that everything is excellent!
50,From the moment you walk thru the doors at Caesars Palace you feel like you‚Äôre entering into a dream full of luxury. I get the same feeling every time I stay at Caesars and that‚Äôs exactly why I return time after time.  This time I stayed in the Augustus Tower overlooking the pool that has the wonderful water display. The rooms are always beautifully decorated and the bathrooms are huge and so luxurious. The mattresses are so comfy that I could just stay in the bed the entire visit!  We had dinner one night in the Diamond Lounge and the food was delicious such a great perk for members of Caesars Rewards in fact the Caesars Rewards is the best of all the rewards programs plus so many locations to visit.  I visited Giada pastry and ice cream shop and had the most delicious ricotta cheese cookies (still dreaming about those cookies) and cherry ice cream.  The valet service is amazing because they handle their high volume of cars so  effortlessly and timely.  I really really enjoy staying at Caesars I like the feeling of being in an opulent palace just a real treat yourself pamper yourself hotel Caesars Palace Hotel!! See you again real soon!!
50,If your headed to Las Vegas make sure your itinerary includes a trip to the world famous Buchanel Buffet. This is excellent dining experience and includes a wide range of international cuisines and dessert that have been assembled in the longest buffet I‚Äôve ever seen in a expansive cavernous dining space with highly professional and high quality staff to serve your needs. Highly recommend!
50,I have been at Caesars Palace in the past for several concerts and as usual always a pleasure being there. Always a great experience just walking the casino floors enjoying Mariah Carey concert and enjoying some drinks at the bar with family/friends.
40,Our stay was amazing love this place. Besides the part that we made platinum and we had to drive to the parking structure I‚Äôm the back when we could of just pulled up in the front . But besides that we love this hotel
40,I dont know much about the hotel but the buffet is awesome if you are ok to wait for like an hour for a good food.  Casino was clean with plenty machines.  Ah! There is a huge shopping mall inside with so many good stores.
50,Caesars is always a vibe! Great casino and staff and rooms. The food is amazing and there‚Äôs so much to do It‚Äôs always a great time. 10/10 would recommend anyone staying here! I will be staying here religiously!
50,Caesars employees go out of their way to ensure that your visit is enjoyable. Rooms are great lots of room and very comfortable. Casino floor has lots of action and fun machines. Lots of eating options from take-out style to fine dining. Very good rewards program.
50,Another trip to caesars palace las vegas. Had a nice thanksgiving stay. Rooms are spacious and service is great. Will return for future stays. Our favorite place to stay. Looking forward to future stays. Excellent!
50,Clean and very friendly staff especially in VIP registry. Very friendly staff her name was Princess..  She gave us very good recommentations on shows and dining. Many options in games too. The Italian Resaurant Rao's was excellent in food and service.... I took my friend's family and they really loved it.
50,If you visit the Vegas then stay in Caesars Palace.  They will treat you like a Caesar because they did to me.  Foods and services are excellent. I went for family vacation. Every my family member are happy and enjoy it.
50,During our stay my wife got very ill the staff did such a great job of making her feel so comfortable and they are stay very pleasant and will certainly return again.  We had to book an extra night because she couldn‚Äôt travel home and the staff made every accommodation and could to help us
50,If you are looking for one of the best bartenders IN THE WORLD then look no further my friends! Richard G. and Rick S. are the real deal. Best all around delicious libations banter friendliness knowledge positive attitude and efficiency are second to none! You can go in a stranger and come away a friend for life. Coupled with an amazing service and host staff (Lynda and Melissa two of my Favs) this should always be on your must-visit lists!
50,Everything is convenient and you can find everything in one place  You can find anything good shows slot machines table games and good restaurants.  I enjoy the time there I like to see all the glamor in the place.
50,Amazing trip again! I have been coming here for over 10 years. Caesars Palace is like a second home! Everyone is always so friendly especially the staff. Most Favorite place: The Laurel Lounge (formally known as the Diamond Lounge) From the AWESOME bartenders Richard G. and Rick S. to the wonderful staff/servers/butlers including the beloved Lynda M. and Melissa you will never be disappointed. A MUST visit. Seriously if you are still reading this STOP! Immediately book a flight and enjoy a touch of paradise!
40,We always travel during thanksgiving to Las Vegas and this was our first time booking at Ceasers Room was nice but not what I requested restaurant too busy and expensive clean. I am a Platinum card holder was told free valet and it was not too busy only accepted Diamond and seven stars.
50,one of the best place to visit so many things to see so many shows and beautiful night club.  the shopping center are not that much expensive.above all u see beautiful art and artistic building restaurant
40,Amidst all the glitter there is a hotel that caters to your every need Very helpful staff and when you get lost in the maze of hallways casinos and entryways when you ask they usually not only told you directions but actually escorted you to your destination.
50,The casino has good selection of table games which vary from $5 and up. I'm not a gambler so I play $5 or $10 tables and I enjoy the friendship and laughter we have at the tables. No shortness of cocktails either which is great for me and my friends/family.
50,Yes I will let people know about my excellent stay at Caesar‚Äôs Palace With Joly being at the casinos Gamboa the place is wonderful to be all the people are really friendly to go back soonThanks everyone for you For being so nice to us we love to stay again
50,My experience was outstanding here i had a great time and i wished i had a room at Caesars during my stay at vegas. I plan on booking a room here everytime i visit Las Vegas each time. All workers were knowledgeable of the entire facility and directed us properly.
30,I understand the challenges of today‚Äôs Las Vegas casinos. Indian casinos around the country have pirated many of their past customers. The new target market is Asia. Those direct flights from Beijing to Las Vegas speak loudly of the direction. Those visitors are not going to book a family vacation at an Indian casino in Michigan. These wealthy visitors don‚Äôt look for $10 Blackjack tables. They aren‚Äôt interested in a cooked to perfection 130¬∞ rib eye grilled on wood. They will buy $8 lattes and the overhyped and over priced but under served crap at Ramsay‚Äôs Hell Kitchen.    I‚Äôm not the target. Im a 70 year old Boomer from Montana looking for great food and $10 Blackjack.    Caesars now has a new trick you need to beware of. There are Kuerig coffee machines in the rooms BUT the coffee pods are in a rack and are part of the pay through the nose ‚Äúmini bar‚Äù. I never used them but got charged for Mini-Snickers to the tune of $14.99. Full disclosure: When I texted the very helpful virtual concierge to tell them I didn‚Äôt anything from the mini-bar they took it off my bill. Check your bill carefully!
50,All the employees were friendly and professional. Room was clean and the plethora of restaurants within the property meant you never had to go outside to enjoy first class dining. The entertainment at Cleopatra's Barge was top notch.
50,The Flamingo hotel and casino are always a blast to visit. The staff is amazing! The location on the strip is close to everything you might want to do and see. I recommend staying at Caesar‚Äôs resorts to my friends and family.
10,Charge me for a water at the mini bar that I didn‚Äôt even used dirty rooms had people‚Äôs hairs in bed and charge me for fees I was not even aware of very disappointed never coming back to this garbage hotel
50,My stay at Caesar's Palace has been outstanding. My room is amazing and the service has been wonderful. Caesar's Palace is an excellent location on Las Vegas Boulevard because it's centrally located and close to everything. Thank you Caesar's Palace for the great experience.
10,Unauthorized of my credit card by Ceasers Palace. Very low brow.  So you check in. They hold $200 for incidentals. During our trip....day 2 they charged my card $62.50. The bad part is I didn't anything for that amount. I asked about this and they said not sure what charge was for and is nothing can about it. Unauthorized use of credit card is ccrime.
20,I went on a staycation for Thanksgiving. They were super busy and we had to wait a long time at the valet.Otherwise the visit was very pleasant and the employees were helpful. The food at Mesa Grill was excellent.
50,Best buffet and restaurants. Hvac system that keeps smoke from the filthy cigarette smokers down to a very minimum. Great stores. Huge casino. Friends were staying in a room that was opulent and def lives up to the name of caesars palace.
50,Fly in for a quick trip to see Jeff Dunham at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace. Clean and comfortable seating. Friendly service. Genuinely happy to serve you. Hotel room was clean updated and very comfortable. The staff at Caesars has improved immensely. I will be back.
40,We stayed in rooms 2851 and 2852 in the Augustus tower in November with our 2 daughters husband mom brother and father in law. We had 2 beautiful suites with amazing views of the strip and Bellagio fountains. Great location in the middle of Las Vegas Blvd and easily walkable to other casinos and the forum shops. The beds were very comfortable and the amenities were fantastic. The only issue we had was there was a strong odor of marijuana in the room especially room 2852. The housekeepers spent over an hour trying to de-fume the room but it helped only marginally. They did not have any other suites available and made room 2852 at times minimally usable. Also FYI they won't provide a microwave in rooms. Overall though a very pleasant stay and we would return.
50,Emma was the person who took our reservation. She was so amazing that following the rest of the stay was just as prefect. Our family enjoy staying in the Forum Tower as it was near The Palm to dine and lots of shopping near by.
50,The trip was great. The service was professional. Michael W. from Caesars Palace Laurel Lounge was fantastic. He always greeted you with a smile and a pleasant comment. We really enjoyed ourselves although it was cold outside.
40,The ameneties was fantastic. Everyone was very helpful and attentive had no issues with the staff. The casino was clean i did not like the pina colada drink the flavor was wierd besides that everything was ok.
40,The beds and pillows were so comfy my husband said he will not stay anywhere else anymore. Great what have you done Caesar's Palace he's spoiled for life now.    Also if you're going to give an incentive to not have maid service $10.00 is just insulting!    Thank you
50,The room was very cozy i had a view of the pool area from my window. I must that the service is always great at caesars. the staff is super great and extra friendly. I didnt have any problems during my stay.
50,Great hotel in a fabulous location. Initially young girl at check in was disappointing as she was unable to provide much assistance. I asked about breakfast options at the hotel and she seemed unprepared for such a difficult question and was unable to answer. However from then on in the service was excellent. The room was great and the facilities on hand were second to none
50,Our room had a breathtaking view of the water show across the street. Location was key and we could quickly walk to the strip if we wanted to. All employees greeted us with smiles and the food at the 3 places I ate at were delicious.
50,The location was in prime location. So close to everything in the main strip. Definitely would recommend going to Ceasers Palace. I heard great things about the buffet but infortunately we were not able to wait in line for it since we were tight on schedule
50,our room was very nice. the fridge had a lock on it hoping this one will not for this up coming trip in December. The hotel was clean and so was the casino. The food was very good as well at all restaurants
50,My wife and I travelled to las Vegas at short notice from new Zealand so that I could give our daughter away at her wedding. We did not tell her we were going to attend and wanted to make it a total surprise. We were checked in by Kristen Smith and she went above and beyond to arrange a surprise meeting with our daughter and fiancee when they checked in the following day. The way Kristen handled what was such a tricky thing to set up was simply amazing and it made our trip the more memorable for it. Our heartfelt thanks goes out to Kristen and Caesars Palace for what turned out to be a very happy and fun filled five days for us and also for the very happily married couple. Thanks also goes to the many other staff that assisted us during our stay. High fives Kristen and best regards.  Al and Maree
50,We were celebrating friends Birthday!!! We had a great time. The SPA was wonderful. Food outstanding. Cocktail waitresses were great!! What more can you ask for. The rooms were outstanding...before our trip I told our host about my friends birthday and the reason for our trip. We had drinks and munchies in the room to help us kick off our Birthday Celebration.
50,Outstanding Experience! Caesar's Palace Las Vegas Casino Resort offers The Best Buffet experience in Vegas - The Bacchanal Buffet worth every penny! Slots not Great Tables Super FUN! Customer Service is impeccable at Caesar's Palace Las Vegas! They treated us like Royalty on this stay and we truly appreciate it!!! If you enjoy gambling ask for our Host KAITLYN SHEGELSKI - she is Fantastic and Delightful!!
20,So disappointed! No complimentary water(even the small ones given on the casino floor would have been fine) and Charging 14 dollars for coffee cream and sugar in the room is outrageous! I have never stayed at a hotel where at least these things weren't available to you. With the prices they charge per night as well as the roughly 50 dollar resort fee daily at the very least these should have been included. While the hotel is beautiful and the rooms are very nice nickle and diming the customer for EVERYTHING is not right. I was also very frustrated that there was nowhere to put leftover food or drinks. The only refrigerator in the room was completely filled with outrageously priced mini bar selections and if you move any of them you get charged (even if you dont drink it). Not being able to buy my own drinks somewhere else or saving food from my meals for later was yet another way for the hotel to get more money. I was very much looking forward to staying in this beautiful hotel but ended up being very disappointed. This was my first and sadly last time staying here.
50,What a great time! All employees were friendly and helpful. Awesome atmosphere and excellent food. Our host Paul Stewart went above and beyond to make our visit exceptional! We can‚Äôt wait to go back again!
50,This was a great trip. Thanks for the great hospitality and accommodations.Outdoing yourselves as always. Cant wait for our return trip. The boys of summer will return and enjoy the pool.    The Solo Family.
40,"Rooms have been nicely renovated no free coffee however the coffee and pastries at the club cappuccino were excellent. Also no free parking (I was charged twice for parking on room invoice and at parking gate so watch out for this) slots payouts were poor drink service was almost nonexistent and I was very disappointed with the timeshare being pushed as a ""special reward"" to Wyndham reward members without saying it was a timeshare presentation."
20,Horrible check in. Room not ready when we explained ahead of time when we would arrive. We waited hours for a message to tell us our room was ready it never came.‚Ä¨  ‚Ä™I plead my case to a man where we were to pick up our keys‚Ä¨ He did help me find a room. As though he was doing me am immense favor. With all the great hotels in Las Vegas it would be hard for me took book another trip here.
20,They didn‚Äôt give me the room or even tower I reserved. Hallways smelled like fish that‚Äôs been microwaved. All the things you think are being offered have exclusions that they don‚Äôt tell you about until after you‚Äôve paid.
50,Add Caesars Palace LV to your bucket List its was my best birthday ever the room awww the buffet they were the best everything was OUTSTANDING I LOVE Caesars Palace thanks for everything best birthday ever.
40,My room was king size bed with a great view.it was very clean and come with a mini bar. I was provided with daily room service.Food was off the chart the buffet and restaurants. The property is large l had to ask direction to room.
50,Clean and comfortable room good food and great atmosphere for good time nice customer services and great rewards for free play and free hotel stays good promotions excellent valet service and room service
50,Check in was fast service was friendly and knowledgeable. The room was beautiful room 3693. We were so lucky to be able to stay in that room. Room service was awesome and the food delicious. Would recommend to anyone that this is the place to stay. I also had a blast on the slots. Thank you Caesars for making my stay magnificent.
10,They'll email you to tease you about online checking to avoid lines... but then it won't work.    You get to the hotel and they have these automated machines... again your hopes will be dashed. I had to leave the machine see a person then go back to the machine! WTF?!    The rooms are nice but service awful. Broken lights. Room hot on arrival and though I asked when I made the reservation not allergy free (more delays in getting settled).    The sheets don't cover the whole mattress (apparently unless you ask).    I was here for a conference the signs were abysmal. The good news is they leave you wandering around in a smokey casino breathing in cancer.
50,4 night stay was perfect . New room in the Palace tower was quiet comfortable and convenient to the pool. Everything at Caesar's is a notch above other places and playing there earns comps fast! Plenty of gaming choices great restaurants and shopping on days you decide to stay in like one of the rainy days we had during our stay.
50,The room was amazing neat and with a beautiful view.  Would recommend Caesars palace to anyone and will gladly come back to stay longer. The staff were all accommodating and the casino have lots of options for slots and table games.
30,It was ok. Hard to get service and seems like the amount of employees has dropped over the years. As the hotel thinks they are cutting areas that customers won‚Äôt feel they‚Äôre wrong. The smoke level in the casino was beyond annoying! Can we please get a smoke free casino. Most people don‚Äôt smoke but we suffer for the turds that are still trying to kill their lung and wreak their breath.
10,Worst experience ever !its a sneaky hotel! Although its one of the expensive hotels on the strip however They were about to charge me for breathing! Nothing on the mini bar is complementary! No big towels or slippers in the rooms unless u pay wifi is only for two persons per room even if its a triple room unless u pay And finaly they charged me for putting my beer in the mini bar!!!
50,The hotel is breathtaking. From the moment we arrived it was like entering a Roman palace. The decor is amazing and for a moment one tends to forget we are in Las Vegas. What I really liked about our stay was that there are lots of things to do besides gamble. You provide so many options to accommodate all ages.
30,The room was amazing most of the people were friendly but the people who ask what you would like to drink are rude. I asked for a club soda politely and she stared at me and rudely asked to see my id.
50,We stayed at Caesar's Palace and enjoyed every minute. The room was large and excellently decorated. We had an great view of the Fountains and the Eiffel Tower. We saw Mariah Carey. Our seats were 5th row and her show was great. We visited the Laurel Lounge and the service was phenomenal. The buffet was impressive. Overall we had a stupendous time.
50,I was upgraded to my diamond membership and given lots of great amenities perks and even a $100.00 celebration gift certificate I‚Äôd say Caesar‚Äôs really goes above and beyond to make sure your enjoying your vacation time thanks to all
30,I was reasonably assured I would get a room in the Palace but I did not. Unfortunately I think the quality has gone down hill at Caesars and there may be better value elsewhere. Next time I will likely look for another resort.
50,Very nice and staff made us feel welcome  there were no issues during our stay or at check in or check out. Employees were also very knowledgeable of the area and willing to offer free advice. We also liked that we could leave our suitcases at the bell desk after we checked out before we departed for the airport
50,The decor the atmosphere everywhere you turn there is something going on. The interior is lovely. I would definitely recommend this hotel over all of the casinos in Las Vegas. The Forum shops are fun to walk through also lots of great food choices and various shopping.
50,We travelled to Vegas for a short vacation and chose Caesars. The check in process was seamless. The rooms were clean and tidy. The staff were cleaning a suite on our floor and even let us take a peak at the room. Holy Molly - Gorgeous. The limo service was outstanding. The Hertz rental went very well. We would suggest the Augustus Tower with a room facing the Bellagio water show
50,Wide selection of slot machines. Not too smoky. Great places to eat that are formal or informal. eatCaesars Forums shops are attached where there is fabulous shopping. Large place so lots of different areas to explore.
30,Had a room for 3 nights. The service and location was great. This is a place with a high class reputation. We were very surprised with the low quality of the bedding. The sheets were rough and almost scratched your skin. I‚Äôm not a picky complaining person. But I was very surprised that the quality has gone down a bit. Caesars is a class brand and we expect class amenities and bedding.
40,The hotel has everything that you would need. Forum shopping inside free show gambling action outdoor pool (although it is winter and the pool was closed) and shows. Restaurant selection was great too from the world famous Buffet to famous chef restaurants. Even the food court selection is diverse.
40,Room was clean and quiet. I liked that the casinos had space between machines and the quality of food at the restaurants on property. They were varied and there was something for everyone. The Forum shops provided fun shopping and there were places to stop and rest if needed. The hotel staff were courteous and professional.
50,The sink in the bathroom is slowly drained out. If that is fixed it is kind of perfect for my trip of staying.  It is beautiful place in Augustus building with a beautiful view with water fountain. I definitely will bring my family member in a short time from now to revisit Caesar.
50,Ceasars what an amazing place to stay! They have great shows lots of choices of slots and table games and my favorite Restaurants Ramseys MEZA grill and the Steak house. not to mention how beautiful the casino is.
40,My room is clean and I am satisfied.  My room is not ready when I got to the hotel.  My room was changed to another room.  Bathroom supplies is good for one person only.  I love this hotel. Ihave been coming to this hotel for a while.
50,The suite we stayed at was very clean spacious and had a lot of entertainment options. Additionally staff was great bringing extra blankets and roll away beds to support our large group. There was some confusion with how to use the tech in the shower in order to get warm water so some instruction there could have been nice.
30,It was okay except for the annoying water leak coming from the shower.Lots of walking to get anywhere. Casino was smoky Canada has smoke free casinos but I knew that so I tried to stay away from smokers and I did manage quite well. The coffee at Guy Biroche was the best I have ever tasted.
10,Stayed at Caesars with family over Thanksgiving. Spent thousands on rooms gambling food entertainment. We moved 2 items from the mini bar to store a $145 Porterhouse steak purchased at the Homestead restaurant . The next morning we replaced the mini bar items. They charged us for the mini bar items because we moved them and then wanted to charge us a $75 restocking fee! They refused to remove the charges although the items were returned to their exact spot! On top of this the doorbell went off every hour from 30 minutes from 3am until 6:30am when the engineer showed up and removed the batteries. She didn't know what was wrong! We had no sleep and all they could say was oops. sorry! I will never stay at Caesars property again! They do not value their customers!
30,We met family in Vegas for the Holiday weekend. Check in was not too bad line was manageable. I was disappointed we were not given any guides maps etc. about things around the hotel. The room was quiet and spacious. I was completely disappointed that we had to pay $15 for K-cups in our room. No free coffee here. Not many quick fare places to eat close by. We got back late from a show Saturday night and there were hookers in the lobby. Very disappointing. The card tables were $100 a hand which is outrageous. Too pricey for me. Next time staying somewhere were I can get a cup of coffee for under $15.
50,We visited Caesars for thanksgiving weekend Wed thru Sunday 2019. Our first time during this holiday weekend. Casino Play was off the hook handpays were given out alot! We had two handpays just on Thursday morning. We had great food ate at Mesa Grill (tip:make reservations) for the first time. The employee at the sports book line was very helpful it was Saturday night around 10pm not too much live sports showing Hawaii vs. Army just started so we sat and watched the entire game it was a great game Hawaii won 52-31. Our room was in the Octavius Tower over looking the pool (pool closed during winter) it was great and quite. Overall 5stars compared to other Vegas properties. Thanks Caesars! see you soon.
50,Hotel was clean very lovely stuff helpful and professional are stay was a very memorable will recommend everyone and definitely go back aging even through this was are 5 th time styling and have a grate experience
40,Resort fees and Parking fees are getting out of control. Resort fees should apply if you use the services and Parking should be complimentary if you‚Äôre a guest of the Hotel. Starbucks in the Lobby provided great service. The food at Noodle 9 was horrible overpriced and service was ok and we were rushed
40,A lot of place to eat. The foodcourt has good selections of food. We don't really have to go somewhere to eat when we are hungry.  Just have to request for room service to have my room cleaned which I don't think I should be doing.
50,We were in Vegas to celebrate 20 years together.!Stopped to play in the casino after a show. My wife and I had a blast in the High Limits area. Service was great and awesome environment to play in. We look forward to our next trip.
50,Lots to do. Staff very friendly. Clean newly remodeled rooms. Plenty of options to eat. Check-in staff was quick and helpful. The options of drinks and food in the room bar were great. Definitely going to return.
50,It was great time food was wonderful gambling was a little tight. Not many machines paying out jackpots but overall we really had a great time. The people in the vip check in were etremely helpful and friendly
50,i have stayed in many hotels in Vegas and this one was beautiful we were staying in the Octavia tower which is the furthest away from reception but not too far closest to the Starbucks for morning coffee. Check in was quick and the room was clean fresh and we had a great view. The room had two queen beds and there were three of us  me mum and sister so no problems for us to share. The normal gadgets in the room and the basic toiletries in the bathroom. A bit disappointed with the coffee machine if you wanted to use it there was a charge for the 4 paper cups that were there so we just went to Starbucks. Hairdryer safe  iron  jacuzzi bath etc... it was a nice room. The hotel casino was a decent size and you could walk straight into the forum shops from there we used the Cheesecake Factory for lunch and a dinner and the prices were really reasonable compared to everywhere else. The amount of food in the restaurants were just insane we quite often shared as we don‚Äôt like waste. Would I use this hotel again I think so it was the perfect location and it had it all. We paid our bill in reception with cash and then checked out by the tv in our room when we were ready to leave. No issues with taxis they were just outside. Taxis back to airport was just $20 but there was more at $38. Got back yesterday a little poorer but we had a fab time.
50,Feels like your in the olden times with grand statues and decor. Restaurants are all top notch eateries. Ate at Gordan Ramseys pub. Food and drinks were off the hook. Shopping is very high end. Place where u can dress up.
50,Very good. the property has an excellent location one of the best on the strip. The room was quit much less noise than other properties on the street which is a very important feature. The standard of food offering is good and Bellagio is right across the corner.
50,We enjoyed the visit very much.we had a great time. Customer service always excellent food and drinks likewise. Gambling was also fun.Did not see any shows.was to cold to walk across the street to Ballys or Flamingo.
10,Our room was a cubicle. No bathtub. View of roof. Non smoking floor BUT we could smell smoke in our room the entire time. Holes in carpet and showing lots of wear. Tiles on floor and bathroom walls were cracked. Shower faucet was literally hanging out of wall. Glasses were dirty and spotted. We were either too hot or too cold...could not regulate room temperature. One of the pillow cases was thread barren and actually had holes in it. Had friends staying in other towers and their rooms were an upgrade compared to ours. We leave there very disappointed as we were really looking forward to staying at Caesars and had enjoyed our stay there in previous years. I would recommend not staying in Julius Tower until they renovate or actually tear to down. :(
40,We decided to stay at Ceasars for one of our nights of a quick staycation. We were able to quickly get parked and proceed to the check in area. Because we have status with Ceasars there is a special area we could check in. Michelle A. was super helpful and got us checked in and recommended that we try a delicious Italian place (Rao‚Äôs) for dinner. We followed her recommendation and weren‚Äôt disappointed. She also gave us a few room options and recommended the Palace tower as it has been newly renovated.    We were on the 23rd floor and had a nice view of the gorgeous pool. Living in Vegas we‚Äôre not overly concerned about seeing the fountains or anything else every time. The room had modern furnishings and a great bathroom with a jetted tub. The controls were a little hard to figure out especially for the sprayer arm the tub had. The things they use in the tub and sink to stop the water from draining were hard to remove and appeared much more decorative than functional.    Biggest pet peeve for what was a wonderful stay was housekeeping knocking and coming into the room at 9AM. We had late checkout so  not sure why this isn‚Äôt noted somewhere for them to reference.
50,First off  Michelle A and Suki at the vip guest check in were fabulous and took care of us from the moment we arrived on property ensuring we had an amazing room and it was ready quickly as we arrived early. The room had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountain show in the Augustus tower and the room itself was large and clean. The buffet at Caesar‚Äôs was delicious even with a packed thanksgiving they made us feel special by having quick vip access. 15 minutes to get in when there were no joke about 500 people in line easy. Great experience and I would also like to recognize Dayska Vekorio my host for arranging an excellent trip for me. It ensures I‚Äôll be a total rewards customer for a long long time.
50,Everything was great. From the very easy check-in the free play money the outstanding room and friendly and knowledgable staff the excellent restaurants to the extremely easy check-out on my iPhone 11 was just super great. My wife and I had an excellent Thanksgiving.
10,We stayed in a 2 story suite with a pool table bar and full kitchen. Ice machine broke soaked carpet upstairs we couldn't go up stairs the entire time. Gave us a handicapped room which the drain for the shower was in the middle of the floor in the bathroom therefore whenever you wanted to brush teeth use bathroom your feet would get soaked. Fridge in kitchen was broke housekeeping was to be desired.
30,This was my first trip to USA. I traveled with my daughter who has been previously & stayed at the Bellagio we ended up deciding on Caesars as the rooms looked lovely & they were offering a better rate. We arrived at 3.30pm & we‚Äôre told our room wasn‚Äôt ready but it shouldn‚Äôt be long & they would phone or email us as soon as it was ready so we headed off to find some food. At 5pm we still hadn‚Äôt heard anything so headed back to check room was ready now. Someone forgot to call. The room was in the Augustus Tower & was really beautiful large & comfortable big bathroom & a nice view. Happy campers. Luckily I had read here that you shouldn‚Äôt touch the minibar or snacks at all as you get charged as soon as you lift them. We wanted to put some milk in the fridge to have with our tea but to do that would cost us $75! There are no prices on anything for the minibar snacks or even on the dinning/room service menu. The average person I would‚Äôve thought would usually wish to know this. The ice machine only worked on one day out of the five we were there even though myself & other guests had reported it. But the internet caused us the most problems. My daughter was there on business & needed to access it. You can only have 2 devices connected then have to pay an extra $15 per day. BUT the internet is the worst we have ever experienced especially for such a quality hotel. Constantly dropping out & then not being able to re connect we were almost new best friends with staff to help with this. But we were told it is a huge problem there. We had been told we had a $20 per day credit to our room per day & if we chose to opt for no house keeping another $10. We checked out today & then found that you had to use the credit on the day you lost it then there was an extra ‚Äúresort fee‚Äù of just over $44 per day. In the end we worked out we may as well have stayed at Bellagio! The staff we dealt with were all lovely (even after the missed call on checkin) & the room was beautiful comfortable & very well soundproofed. But that‚Äôs where the ‚Äúgood‚Äù ended & the bad began.
50,Caesar‚Äôs Palace has the #1 buffet in Vegas. They serve dishes I‚Äôve never seen other buffet lines serve before. Wagyu beef bone marrow and crab legs right out of a steamer instead of a metal pan.    Will definitely go again every time we‚Äôre in Vegas!
50,This is a review for my visit to Laurel Lounge what amazing service from Melisa R. Wow. We were just chilling with friends and she was so sweet. She even remembered our orders and kept checking in us. The drinks were great but Melissa R made the experience amazing.
50,Richard G. and Rick S. are just the most welcoming and fun bartenders anywhere. They‚Äôre class acts who turn strangers into friends with warmth humor and some delicious libations. The butler service is very attentive and the food includes something for everyone. It‚Äôs not one and done when it‚Äôs this much fun.
30,The recent stay at Caesar‚Äôs was not as good of an experience as the hotel should deliver. Upon Check-In and Check-out the Bell Man were unprofessional and lacked the ability to make the guest feel welcomed to the resort. From two bellman arguing over who should be helping us - neither of whom wanted to help while 4 others stood there not doing anything to checking out and needing to have our luggage and bags stored only to be told they could only store 3 bags for 5 guests. 5 guest limited to 3 luggage/bags. Told to take our bags outside to larger storage and not offering or wanting to take the luggage and bags to the storage for us. This behavior was probably out of the norm as the rest of the staff from front desk to housekeeping and room service was very good - the bell desk should be reprimanded being an integral part of the welcome and departure from the hotel.
30,Octavius Tower is quiet and a nice place. All staffs are nice and great us with a smile except front desk. This has been a issue with Ceaser Palace. Everytime I arrive to check in or check out the front desk is always rude and never see them smile. Other hotels I went to in vegas never is an issue. Not sure why. This time the front desk (Omar) did not even try to pretend to listen to my question. However they have a great valet house keeping staffs. Still the property location is awesome. I still love this place just wish their front desk have more hospitality. I always choose between Planet Hollywood or Caesar Palace.
40,I love staying at Caesars palace! Hotel rooms are fantastic and most of the time they offer a great deal. It also has my favorite shopping in vegas with the forum shops. Great buffet here too but we haven‚Äôt been to it for a couple of years. Such a wonderful time! Their pool during the summer months is also really nice.    In terms of negatives...they charge you for the keurig coffee in your room. Just silly. And Caesars is huge and a maze to navigate. So it takes some time to remember exactly where to turn to find your room. But overall Caesars is super nice and really fun. Lots to see and do here! We have stayed here at least two or three times now.
50,Spent Thanksgiving at Caesars with the wife. This property has everything. We enjoyed the room the different restaurants the spa and the casino. Even made a couple BIG hits on the Keno machines. The room was spacious king bed and the shower and large jacuzzi tub were great. We were in the Forum Tower which was by choice as it is close to the casino and the Forum Shops. The property is now new but kept up nice.
50,Check in again was a breeze via mobile check in. But I'm sure there are times its a zoo. We were booked into a suite in the Julius tower. It was spacious and nicely appointed. Remember don't touch anything in the mini fridge or items on the counter unless you're planning on purchasing beverage or snacks as they are monitored by weight.The hotel and casino are huge. There is a large selection of food choices here to feed your appetites( restaurants and a food court). If you're up to it. Try the buffet. It is huge and tasty. Again use and show your Total Rewards card for points to use for freeplay at the casino or redeem it towards your hotel bill. Resort fees are a little higher at this property but the hotel is more upscale.  Is it worth it? You decide. Thanks Caesar's!
30,I couldn't believe how disorganized the valet parking was at the main entrance. Had to go around in circles for 30 min. Until the finally told me they were full up!üòà. The casino is way to big disorganized and chaotic. The rooms are wonderfully but getting wifi to work was a nightmare. Just a bad experience. I usually stay at Paris which I'll probably go to next time!!
50,Great place to stay! A lot of things to do within walking distance. The staff at Cesars is very friendly and helpful and could assist you in finding whatever it is you want to do even if your a first timer! Enjoy!
10,For the last several years my family has come to Las Vegas for Thanksgiving. We always try a different hotel not be cause we are not loyal to a brand but for a new experience.  This year we chose the ICONIC CAESARS PALACE!  This was the first time we have ever stayed at Caesars. We booked our room a month in advance. I was traveling with my wife and my daughter. When we arrived and entered the hotel was beautiful. Much like most large Vegas hotels they have kiosk checking to make things easier(supposedly). They scan your ID and pull up your reservation. We had booked a double queen room in the Augusta Tower. When we were going through the steps to checkin it offers you discounted room upgrades. They showed us a much larger room a One bedroom suite that was only $67 more per night. We had asked for some assistance from on of the employee there to help with the Kiosk. We asked if this larger room had a pullout sofa bed. She didn't know but went to ask. She came back and said no but you would easily be able to get a roll away in there. We agreed and made the up grade.  We got to our room and it was nothing like what was pictured. Big DISAPPOINTMENT!  I used the term ICONIC hotel in the first part of my statement. I now understand the term ICONIC means OLD and OUTDATED! The furnishings looked like furniture from the 70's. Most of it was damaged.  When we inspect the room there was a pull out in the sofa it was of course broken and so was the sofa (see attached pictures).  I went to look at the bedroom and there was dirt on the comforter like someone sat on the bed and had muddy shoes on and to top it off it had someone else's hair on the pillows.  You are charged $52 a day for a resort charge. For $52 you get access to the pool gym and WiFi. It was an average of 40 Degrees while we were there so the pool was out of the question. The WiFi you were Limited to connect 2 device to and it was spotty at best. I've had better WiFi in Third world countries( no exaggeration ).  It's obviously put all of their money into the appearances of the downstairs casino area and none into the rooms! I would never recommend this hotel. It's on the level of Bally's at 3 times the cost. There is a reason it only has 3 stars.
20,Not pleased...Could definitely be cleaner in the rooms. Hair found on the bathroom shower walls and brown substance dried to the bedroom wall and ceiling hoping that is not bodily fluids. Also they need to clean up the nicks and dings seen every where it is starting to look really beat. Casino is smokey compared to others and smells like stale cigarettes. Oh and they have the nerve to charge you for the coffee pods in the room like the ones that come with the janky in room keurig!! $14!!!! Such a joke people don‚Äôt mind spending money but being taken advantage of is another thing. Overall I give it a meh and will stay elsewhere in the future.
50,Visited for a convention. Their venue was excellent. Anyone attending a convention would find the venue excellent with regard to plenty of available rooms. The food and entertainment are unsurpassed. There were 3 other conventions going on and still plenty of space.
40,I really enjoyed my recent stay at Caesars Palace. My room was nice comfortable and clean. The staff were very friendly as well. I would definitely return for another stay and I would recommend Caesars to any would-be travelers to Las Vegas.
50,First time staying at Ceasars. Service was outstanding. The property incredible! Can't wait to get back. So much to do we couldn't get to everything. Food entertainment and gaming at Ceasar's cannot be beat! Enjoyed the breadth of Ceasar's with other smaller casinos in the network. Fun to simply cross the street and have a different experience at an affiliate casino.
50,the employee that helped me was nice and very helpful. she said that I will be informed by mail or by e-mailed if my application was approved and she gave me a new card because I left the original at home.
50,Checking in was a breeze we had great interactions/service since the kiosks weren't working. Casino concierge mall employees restaurants and overall rooms were top notch! We will be back at Ceasars.
40,good service but can be a lot better. sometimes not enough of fast service but a lot of courtesy. If you need your luggage fast do not give it to bell boy. Go to the rear valet parking maybe the front does not take your car and you will be driving around the building in traffic just to get through.
50,The show was excellent entertainment. I attended after a visitor at another show recommended it. True fun and excitment. The music and stunts were engaging during each set.    Be aware of the seating though...eclectic styled.
50,Room was great and service is always excellent and always satisfied every time we visit any ceasers property. Highly recommend ceasers palace to all my family and friends. Room is meets our expectations
50,Fun place. Caesars really does it right. First class all the way. The buffet is one of the best if not the best in all of Las Vegas. The employees can‚Äôt do enough to make you happy and comfortable. Wish I could‚Äôve won a little bit in the casino though.
50,This actually was my first time in Las Vegas at age 62 and I wanted to to have a great experience- Caesars‚Äô Palace help make it great. It is classy and so are the people who stay here. It might sound snobby - but you just have to go to the other places to see the difference. In addition to the classy atmosphere the service was great - from the maids to front seat to anyone we met who work in the hotel or the connecting shops. It is as centrally located as you can get abs that made it easy to see most shows. If I come back I would absolutely stay here.
40,stayed at the flamigo nice clean room. the phone operators were very friendly and knowledgeable  played baccarat at ceasers had fun  played other games at planet holywood nice friendly dealers  overall fun experience
20,Caesars is a very large casino and hotel property so plan on walking a long distance to get to the elevator to your room. Otherwise the rooms in the hotel in the casino are very nice. However I would not trust their parking valet. On the last day of my trip I picked up my rental car from the valet went to the airport and when I returned the rental I found a large dent and yellow scratch on the passenger side of the rental car. The only person to drive the car between when I returned to Caesars and when I picked it up in the morning was the parking valet attendant. I called Caesars their security department said they would investigate but they never got back to me. It cost just under $1000 to have the rental car repaired. Do not trust their parking valet and check your vehicle thoroughly every time you pick it up.
50,No need to get out of the hotel to shop and dine! From regular to high end stores everything is accessible! The hotel offers a variety of affordable and delicious selection at the food court. Will definitely stay here again in the future!
50,Check in was fast and I didn't do it online! There is a lot to do here in Caesar's as well as the mall. Great resturant choices I especially loved the charred steak at Old Homestead. Stay in the Augustus tower it's right by the registration and you get to walk by Starbucks!!!!
40,Love this place! Great restaurants and lots of fun Always go there when in Las Vegas. Try the restaurants and the stores. Great shopping and ambience. The food is tasty and everything is there. It is a must see!
50,We moved to Caesars Palace after a horrible experience at the Linq. Caesar‚Äôs was great! Check in was smooth and easy. The rooms are huge and clean. I loved the bathroom with the private toilet and oversized jetted jacuzzi tub. Everyone there was very nice and helpful. It‚Äôs in a great central location only ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù I have is we didn‚Äôt have a view of the strip but we had a pool view hahaha!
50,All of the Caesars properties are absolutely lovely! We spent a little time at each of them and were not disappointed on any level. I highly recommend not only Caesars Palace but the Flamingo far exceeded my expectations!
40,great stay except no free coffee and condiments in room most hotels have free coffee tea and choco packs in room. excellent location and very decent restaurants lots of shopping at the forum shops. overall a very pleasant stay.
40,Great location many good restaurants excellent buffet.  We was able to walk around the strip by staying this hotel.  We had buffet for dinner that is best buffet compared quality and price with others such as Wynne.
50,The Hotel has wonderful location and services. Caesar‚Äôs Palace is the best in Vegas. I would recommend Cesar‚Äôs Palace Las Vegas every day. Employees are friendly and always willing to help. Excellent shopping experience.
50,Excellent value and a TRUE VEGAS EXPERIENCE: Great food and beverage accompanied by excellent gaming entertainment and just the perfect amount of Over the Top Luxurious Appointments. MESA by Bobby Flay is truly the best experience in Caesar's for all day multiple experience dining-Brunch Dinner. For the three square delicious meals there is the Americano Cafe which sports a sports bar area and a dining opportunity not to mention the lavish dinning arena with both outdoor and indoor appeal. There is no outdoor area but you feel like you are outside.  The room oh the room! A slight upgrade and you are in palatial space with views of the pools. Yes Pools plural.
50,Really great hotel and stay! The rooms were amazing and so were the restaurants. There‚Äôs a lot to do when staying at Caesars like shopping dining and gambling. I had a really great stay everything worked out great I didn‚Äôt really run into any issues.
50,As a Diamond member Caesars Palace LV offers a beautiful serene check in counter. Warm drinks and dainty pumpkin tarts were nicely presented for guests checking in Thanksgiving long weekend. I was greeted promptly by Suki. She was friendly and efficient. Suki was keen on answering all my questions and provided maps and ensured we knew where we going. Thanks Suki for starting our trip off right!
50,The room was magnificent and staff was very friendly. I will stay at Caesars Palace anytime that I go to Las Vegas. The dealers were personable and took the time to share how to play any of the table games. They treated everyone respectfully.
40,Went with friends we had a good time. Would like more cocktail servers on friday Saturday and Sunday. More floor employees to assist with questions. Wish that is was easier to have a better location for pickup of uber or lyft.
40,We always stay at Caesar's when we go to Vegas which is regularly. Good service comfortable beds excellent restaurant and bar choices. Super location. My only caution is just because you request a certain location does not mean that you will get it in fact it rarely does. We have requested Augustus tower and 8/10 get put in Octavius. I was hopeful that repeated stays would increase the chance of our request being met but so far it has not. Nonetheless this remains our favorite location and resort of choice.
30,It‚Äôs hard to win on any table games unfriendly employees. Slow on serves es. Rooms and restaurants and great. Hotel is very clean and it is located in a good area. Might check the time of year you go I guess maybe they are in better moods.
50,Rooms were easy to get to and were clean. Hotel was a good location on the strip casino was a tad smokey but we just moved to a different spot in the casino and it was better. Variety of locations to eat.
50,My adventure was good. I need too too say the customer services in general was great and very helpful and had my back as i lost my wallet or it got stole. They helped me with so much stuff and guided through the sign on period.
40,We enjoyed our stay at Caesar‚Äôs. The rooms are absolutely exceptional. The casino did not meet our needs. They could improve in their selection of $1 slots. We did not spend much time gambling at their casino we ventured to other hotels. The staff is amazing and very helpful. Wear a jacket if you plan on gambling they keep the air on high even when it‚Äôs freezing outside.
50,Great experience elegant room. Seamless check in didn't feel too crowded even though a big name show was playing. Easily got into eating establishments with great service. Only drawback is the lengthy walk from parking garage to check in desk
50,Very nice hotel and great quality service and very good casino simply the best. I stayed for 6 days and it is at prime place with access to all near by places. Food is great with all shoppings and restaurants.
30,It was okay could have been better tho! Didn't get the room I was promised and didn't get any acknowledgement as to the reason I was there that weekend which I was told at booking would happen! Overall the Julius tower is dated and in need of repairs which was evident
40,Always a fun time. Room was not up to par with what I usually receive at Caesars but the food and casino are first rate. People working there are friendly and helpful. Best location on the strip. I feel welcomed Everytime I visit.
50,Wonderful place to stay and play. Roomy and spacious with plenty of options for high end dining to lower end food court. Plenty of lounges for relaxing and having drinks. Large sports book and of course ...... gambling. This is a legend and main staple of the Las Vegas strip!!!
30,We are about to leave Caesar‚Äôs shortly and leave for our flight home. Overall our stay at Caesar‚Äôs has been pretty good - the facilities are good as are the rooms.    What has been up and down though is the level of customer service. We have had great service by bar staff at times but poor service on other occasions. One example of this was when we were late getting picked up from our hotel for a helicopter ride we had booked. We needed to phone the company we had booked it with as we were not sure if our transport was going to arrive as it was already late. We asked for someone on the Bell Desk to call the phone number of the company for us and he told us to go outside to the Valet area and ask a member of staff there which we did. This member of staff was completely uninterested and told us to use their staff phone ourselves. We expected that the staff would have been a little more willing to help us on this occasion but they were not.    Another issue is the reward vouchers which entitle each guest to a ‚Ç¨10 food voucher each day. The theory of it sounds great but in reality a lot of the staff here do not know how they work and as a result this has caused us problems. Basically you need photographic ID with you to do anything at Caesar‚Äôs. When I have visited Starbuck‚Äôs this morning the member of staff there refused to let me use the voucher as the room was not booked under my name yet my name is listed on the hotel room. Other staff at the same establishment have allowed me to use the voucher. There is a completely lack of consistency amongst the staff here in relation to these vouchers.    Overall if I ever return to Las Vegas I will probably opt to stay at a different hotel.
50,The best service in vegas the Caesar hotel is perfect good restaurant and bars and is safe the cocktail is good the buffet good quality and the rooms is clean and good service the stores is perfect is the best place for vegas
50,This was a visit due to trying to find the free shows they have in the Forum Shops. It was a long walk coming from the Flamingo Rd side. But it's spectacular inside. Glorious shops and decor. I didn't catch a show but got some amazing pictures. I could only imagine what the rooms look like. Absolutely spotless and gorgeous bathroom. This place is as breathtaking inside as it is out.
50,My Laptop Bag did not make it to my room after it was loaded on through Valet. Jorge Salvidar-Bellman and the his team along with the folks from Valet went above and beyond and found my bag. Thank You.
40,I was wondering why I pay a extra 44.32 a night when the pools and hot tub are closed.ipayed and extra 40 a night because it had a hot tub in itand when we got to the room it didn‚Äôt work.ICall first thing and it took to the following day. It is a very nice place and would stay there again.but when things go bad they need to step up and make it right
10,DO NOT STAY HERE without knowing you are going to be charged $45 per day for crappy wifi as ‚Äúresort fees‚Äù once you get to Caesars. This is charged to your card AT THE BEGINNING of your stay. The hotel is enormous and good in every other way so if money is no object go for it.  If I went again I would stay in another hotel in a different part of the city
50,"We love Caesars LV! We are 7 Stars members who travel there several times each year. Our Casino Host Sara Domingo is the absolute best makes us feel welcome each trip and helps with anything we need. The Laurel Lounge at Caesars is a huge draw for us. The outstanding people in the LL (DL) make Caesars hospitality what it is. Their amazing service and welcoming professional attitudes are un paralleled in our travels. Bartenders Rick Sims and Richard Gonzales are the best in the business by far!! All of the servers at the tables are fantastic as well. Jeff Baggenstos Ana Jimenez Melissa and Linda are absolute shining stars and amazing people to spend time around. These friends we have in the LL (DL) and the friends we will make on our next visit are the main reason we continue to come back time after time to CPLV !! For us having all of the world class entertainment food gambling shops galleries and rooms available at Caesars along with the cool help that ""Ivy"" the texting concierge offers we rarely leave the property until it is time to head to the airport."
50,We stayed here for a weekend to celebrate two birthdays. The hotel it‚Äôs self is HUGE and GORGEOUS!! The room was very specious clean and nice. Staff was very friendly and helpful.  - They do have self park or valet parking if you have a car. Self parking was $18US per day.  - Check-in was a bit of a wait but nothing too bad  - if you are a smoker you can smoke anywhere in the Casino (not just in Caesars but in any hotel/casino)  - the location of Caesars is perfect it‚Äôs near everything we walked everywhere.  - you can SHOP in every hotel  **just a tip for dinning though-out the day I would keep your breakfast and lunch more simple (fast food places are everywhere along the strip) and splurge at dinner (if you want to save some money)  ***go to a CVS or Walgreens to buy your drinks (water beer juice or liquor) it will help you save some $$$ there is a CVS very close to the hotel. Water in the hotel room is $8 per bottle... also we ordered 4 drinks at Omnia night Club and it was $80 LOL PRE-DRINK before people!!!!    We can‚Äôt wait to visit Vegas again!!!!! Thank you Caesars for a great weekend :)
50,The stay was great. The staff is wonderful and housekeeping made our stay much better by being attentive to our needs. Towels were changed daily and clean sheets. Which  are a pet peeve of mine. Loved it!
50,Friendly Atmosphere....High energy... Great place to stay. Food was excellent also late nights snack spots were great. If you like gambling... great variety of games tables as well as slots... Colosseum for shows easy access.  Have Fun!
10,We choose here to get married and for the actual ceremony it was all perfect but our stay in general was not good. Our guests who also stayed at the hotel missed our ceremony because no one in the hotel could give them directions to our chapel which lead them to miss it. They were super upset. Also we had issues with parking every single day! Always had to call to get assistance and the worst part also was that our room keys wouldnt work. I had to go down to the front desk one night and then one night the kids and us had to sit on the floor waiting on security to get let into our room because the key wouldnt work and they even had the wrong room # when they came to help us. Just a bad experience and we spent a lot for our wedding to be there. I also had to keep asking them to clean our room
40,The only thing that was disappointing was that the pool was closed. We almost stayed at Bellagio for their pool but heard Caesar‚Äôs pool was great. Little did we know it was closed for an event. We had looked forward to a pool day that didn‚Äôt happen.
40,Nice 1 bedroom suite hotel staff were prompt and great! Would think coffee came with the room but no $14 for 4 K-cups or order room service coffee at $26 for 6 cup carafe in room dining and mini bar was a little pricey for me.
50,Beautifully appointed room with TV that rotated to face either the bed or the sofa. Very comfortable bed and easy check-out procedures. Would definitely come back here. Service was professional and prompt. Caesars Palace is huge and one can get lost in it.
50,The room was fantastic as well as the opportunity to upgrade for a spectacular and spacious room. The service from check-in to check-out including room service and the Americano Cafe were exceptional. Our casino host started us off in a great room we were upgraded for a minimal fee.  The games were excellent and the atmosphere was consistent with our expectations.
40,Had a great time went to a seminar. Took my wife for the first time really enjoyed the hotel and the shopping as well. Staff was very nice we liked the kiosk check in as well. Ready to come back! Weather was great but we were sad the pools were closed.
50,"First time visiting Las Vegas and was impressed beyond expectations staying at caesars palace at LV. I stayed in the Octavius Tower which is a bit of a walk to get to the tower but there are tons of short cuts all over the place to get you between point A and B. If you're someone with mobility issues or can't walk much look towards another tower. For me the walking was fine. It was the closest to the bacchanal buffet but the lines there were ridiculously long and I traveled solo I skipped buffet as there are SO MANY food options at Caesars and Las Vegas for that matter! The room itself was quite large (considering) including a hot tub and a small living room area (couch and table) with a view of the pool. Since it's the non summer season the pool was closed so wasn't much to see there. The bed was very comfortable and had no issues sleeping. The room itself is a little dated as the color combination of the furniture is quite bland but it's fine so long as the room is cleaned and functional that's all that matters. Also very quiet floor oddly especially being next to the elevator. There is also plenty of storage space a huge closet and various drawers. Beware of the ""fridge"" which isn't really a fridge lol .. and mini bar up on the counter .. don't touch or open packages as you will be charged. There is a keurig in the room but the pods cost $$. There are plenty of locations near the hotel such as cvs & Walgreens where you can pick things up such as water and snacks. Don't buy at the property as the prices are insanely up charged. There are also tons of Starbucks all over the place but also be wary of the prices. But often if you need a quick fix you'll gladly pay lol. If you can walk go to the Starbucks in forum plaza mall (also inside the property but a bit of a hike unless you exit property and walk a block north) as this is a non caesars Starbucks and you can use Starbucks rewards there (not at caesars properties tho). Overall each person i encountered was so friendly and outgoing .. good morning and good evening greetings were not uncommon. Look fwd to next time!"
50,Caesars Palace is the best of the best properties on the Las Vegas strip. Our journey started with an awesome check in experience with Clarae. Not only did she get us through the process quickly she also ensured our parties coming in the next day would be staying on the same floor as everyone else. Just one of those little things that makes your stay that more memorable. Thanks Clarae!    There is not a bad room in the house. We prefer to stay in the Nobu Augustus or Julius towers. The Octavius and Palace towers are a little further away from the action but the rooms are just as nice as anywhere else on the property. The Augustus tower has a nice view of the Bellagio fountains (or pool on the other side) whereas the Nobu and Julius towers have a view of the strip. Nobu is a totally different experience with a swanky interior and its own check in counter.    Our favorite restaurants inside Caesars are Rao's and Old Homestead. You have to try the Ravioli Purses @RaosRetaurants. Ricotta cheese and pears (sounds weird but boy does it work) in a brown butter sage sauce - my favorite. Choose any steak @OldHomestead and you cannot go wrong. My preference is the Ribeye which is seared nicely and cooked to perfection. You will not leave either restaurant hungry. Dinners are a little pricey but for us it's about the experience and enjoying our vacation.    The gambling floor has a wide selection of games. The tables minimums can go up to an uncomfortable level which may be too high for many. However you can hop to other Caesars properties (Ballys Paris Planet Hollywood etc) where the table stakes are lower. Overall the Caesars properties are the best place to gamble compared to others on the strip - especially if you like video poker.    We have stayed at every hotel on the strip (even some that have been imploded) over the last 30 years but for the past 7 years we only stay at Caesars Palace. Some hotels who used to be our go to properties many years ago have gone in a negative direction (Mirage Treasure Island) as they reduce their investment in the property (my opinion). You will definitely experience the difference between Caesars and other locations who do not invest.    Bottom line you cannot find a better experience than Caesars Palace. A long time staple on the Vegas strip that continually invests in the property to ensure an exceptional experience for their guests.
50,My son surprised me because he works on Thanksgiving by flying me to Vegas! Ceasar's is in the middle of the actuon and walking distance to grat shops food and souviners! It was a quuck two-day stay but Ceasar's Palace indeed made me feel royal! Can't wait to come back with my husband!
20,Overall this stay was a disappointment. The parking when we arrived was a complete mess. It took about 30 minutes waiting just to park. The bell staff did not direct traffic. The check-in was a wait. The room was very tired- frayed carpet old bathroom with loose fixtures. It seems like the management is not really putting much into upkeep or service these days. It used to be such a great hotel.
30,4th visit to Caesars and definitely the worse. Booked this time through a host that kept calling me to book another visit. It started with not the room type he promised for us and went down hill from there. He did apologize and got us concert tickets for Rod Steward. He said for our comps on this visit that we needed to charge our meals and such to our room so he could take care of them. Sounds nice doesn't it? Checked in with him several times on the trip to be sure our gambling level was adequate to cover our charges put on our room. He said we were good and to make sure we had another dinner before checking out and he got us a ride set up for back to the airport. When we checked out we discovered he used all of our Caesars credit card points against our account !!!!! These were points I was using for Christmas shopping and a planned Tahoe trip in December. He even took my points for the concert tickets. Also because I didn't have enough points to cover the approximate $1300 in room charges they charged my credit card for $200. I am very disappointed in what I consider a bait and switch tactic that they used. I will never use a host again for booking a Caesars trip.
50,Always great to visit Caesars Palace when in Las Vegas. It's a very beautiful property with lots of places to take photos. There always seems to be a lot of action on the slot floors and in the sports book area.
30,Update your casino ASAP    Room had cigarette smell. Old carpet. No hair dryer. No USB chargers üò≥. CASINO NEEDS UPDATE.    Very little blackjack tables roulette etc. need different options at the food court.    They have refrigerator with weight sensitive. So if you even look what they have and take it out and put it back they will charge you. Atleast this was shared by checkin counter associate.
40,great loction very very clean etc.close to shoppinggreat accsess and eazy to get to.food was out of this world.. had a great time enjoed it all will do it agin soon..great parking and service but did not winn lol
50,The best part of my stay is the room. Its so clean and spacious. I have problem sleeping in my $6000.00 dollars matteress but at Caesars i sleep like a baby on their matteress...so rested each day. The shower room is amazing. The water pressure is fantastic!!! I enjoy taking shower everyday spoiling myself a good water massage. Hsekeeping is wonderful everyday we come back to a clean room with lots of fresh towels....Love it at Caesars Palace!!!!!
20,Stayed in an upgraded room in the palace tower. The room had a very nice bathroom but that was the last part of the positives I could say about the overall stay. There was no free coffee in a room you upgrade. Even called the front desk about the coffee and its 100% only pay for coffee.
40,Problems with type of room we were to receive. We have always received suites in the past but got a very ordinary room this trip. The regular casino host we work with was off when reservations were made so this may have contributed to the mix up.
40,have a good time and exiting on table games. room service is great the room is clean and comfy.    nice place for shopping great golf wrap up the dealer is very nice and helpful    ilas vegas is the nice place for vacation.
50,"We love Caesars Palace! Our room was above and beyond what we expected. The customer service is top notch. The casino is clean and well organized. A great variety of games and plenty of action. We are not ""high rollers"" but they certainly made us feel that way."
50,All went very nice except at Paris they only have one black jack table at the VIP and it‚Äôs open all day long you are controlled by the that table so if the shoe go bad you you will never recover so you keep going trying to recover which will never happen. Never play on one table if it get bad.
40,Over all good. But comps where non existent. Should 've booked my own rooms and not come in on a promo. Plus I found a lot of ladies of the night roaming around. I sort of felt I was at Excalibur. Surprisingly.
50,Life time experience everything was easy to acessbut most of me an wife had a stupendous time.we went several attractionsBally‚ÄôsFlamingosWater Dancegift shopsindoor food courtoutdoor food Court
40,Had a great time at Caesars. Was staying at Flamingo but love that I can get points for playing there and other Caesars properties. Also am at Diamond Level this year so the Laurel Lounge was a wonderful experience. Have been taking advantage of this really nice space with hot food served in the afternoon and an unlimited bar what's not to love right? (Even though I don't drink i got a nice non alcoholic strawberry daquiri which was delicious.
50,Aerosmith Concert  The concert was pretty good but very loud they didn‚Äôt play what we expected so somewhat disappointed. The trip was great and was very happy with the food at the Homestead at Caesar‚Äôs Palace it was amazing and the service was perfect!
50,Had a great experience at Caesars the friendly staff took good care of me and my family. The staff were nice and looking forward to my next visit. Hope to win a bunch of money next time. See you soon!
50,Trips that myself and family have takening over years has been such a joy experiencing and learning about our travels and receiving these tips about these area's that TripAdvisor staff enlighten us about.
20,The floor of this property is massive! It has everything gaming beautiful rooms food and of course shopping. My big complaint was the service at the front desk because of my door not working and the technician lack of following up or meeting his appointment to fix the door.
30,I have been coming here for over 15 years annually with my girl friends...We have stayed in all of the different Towers but prefer Nobu or Augustus. This year we stayed at the Julius Tower and my room was great and had a nece view of the strip. But the linens on the bed were scatchy and hot. Even the towels were of an inferior quality.. We always arrive in Vegas early and know that we cant always get rooms apon arrival but this year we were actually shocked to learn we had to pay $40 fee to get bumped to top of the list when rooms became available. Time to reconsider Caeser's as our #1 Destination in Vegas.
50,I‚Äôve been coming for the past 30 years and Caesar‚Äôs has always outperformed all the other casinos. It‚Äôs an icon that everyone knows. The hotel rooms are awesome. All the shops are top notch. The staff has always been friendly.
50,Was here for a bday. Had a wonderful time. Staff was attentive and accommodating to all requests. Getting in was not a problem at all since we had bittle service. Good crowd for off season midweek would come back again.
30,Dirty poorly maintained room. Spoiled and under cooked food. POS computer system not functional. Staff not empowered to resolve customer issues Loyal Caesar customer for many years. Property is going downhill.
50,Caesars is a outstanding selection for any type of trip. We stayed at the hotel with family and friends. The hotel itself is magnificent the staff is friendly and professional. Hotel is located in the middle of the strip which is very convenient. Casino has many gaming options.
40,Caesars Palace is a Vegas Strip classic. The casino amenities and service are always a good time.  Even though we were staying elsewhere we made a point to spend a good amount of time at Caesars. There is so much to explore and enjoy here--not just the gambling. Surprises await around every corner.
40,Room and Experience were wonderful great location lots of activities  friendly and helpful staff decent rewards lots of gambling options shopping in the forum shops offers lots of options casino transportation provided great service
50,Caesars is a very clean and comfortable hotel to visit. People are very friendly and helpful if you need anything. Went to see Absinth and enjoyed my time there. I would recommend caesars to anyone who visits Las Vegas.
50,excellent trip just before christmas with my friends and the weather was fantastic The marathon was also very awsome. Enough for me to sign up for next years race it was just fantastic. It was a perfrect trip
10,"A few girlfriends and I decided to stay at Caesars 4 bedroom suite also known as the ""Hangover Suite"" from the movie. It was a DISASTER from the beginning. First of all I am a diamond member of Caesars rewards and the check in process was over an hour long resulting in us going outside to drag our bags up. We get to our room and we find this old outdated room which appears to resemble Hugh Hefner's 80's palace. The room has the previous guest's liquor bottles and glasses up no towels in any of the bathrooms and a rattling sound in the 2nd King suite. We request a few blankets to be sent up to our room so we can hang out in the living room area and that phone call was over 30 minutes long. The guest service person could not locate the reservation and then she had the wrong name on the reservation. After it was all resolved they had to verify the person's home address the reservation was under. My 8 friends would not know my home address by memory and ended up sending 1 blanket for 8 girls to the room. I finally called on Saturday morning and spoke to a Sammy in management who apologized and offered a $150 room credit to enjoy room service on them. We ended up using $75 on desserts 1 breakfast and 2 Fiji waters to use up this credit that we given to us. At check out we go to find out that the credit was supposed to be used at restaurants! and not room service. This was a terrible $5281 experience of our weekend. I tried complaining to the manager whose name was COBRA. She was super unhelpful and showed no compassion for our experience or lack there of. I am very disappointed in Caesars for treating their Diamond members the way that they did."
50,Had 4 rooms at Pairs and 2 rooms at Caesar's Palace.  Very courtesy and helpful suggestions at check in at both Diamond counters.  Timely janitorial services and very knowlegeable employees when requesting directions  within the casino floor
30,I was promised a room in the Augustus or Octavious Tower and did not get that at check-in. The man who checked us in was not very friendly at all. The Julius Tower was okay just not what we are used to at all.
50,I cannot give ratings that couldn't be any higher (if there was a 6 I would do it) due to the caring staff at all levels at Caesars Palace. The Rewards Desk folks specifically Raymona Lisa and Shawn are absolutely customer service focused and go above and beyond to make sure that their clients are treated as such. Absolutely everyone who is a staff member in the poker room (managers dealers) and the servers (Kate Alexandra and Plemana Jax) always are kind professional and caring! The food at Hells Kitchen (and Manny/Michelle) along with Pronto by Giada (weekend brunch is outstanding) and their entire staff and at the food court the Crepe restaurant has the best ice cream ever along with the new Smoke and Sizzle Barbecue (best rotisserie chicken burnt ends and seasonal cobbler with ice cream from The Crepe place along with the Halal Guys staff/chicken and the Wok kung pao chicken are outstanding. To all thank you for going above and beyond and making your Place feel like home!
30,One of the busier hotels on the strip. Great hotel to stay at if you are here to shop to see and to experience the iconic Caesars Palace of Las Vegas. Easy access to shops clubs casinos steakhouses and many more awesome restaurants. Located next to the Bellagio and depending on the tower you are staying at you might have views of Bellagio Fountain.    The rooms here could be a hit or miss.    HIT: rooms in Palace tower and Augustus were renovated in recently years although you can still some of the flaws and aging of the carpet or the bathroom.  MISS: rooms are a bit outdated in the forum or Julius tower.    Most of the staffs are friendly but table game dealers definitely are more serious compare to other casinos.    If you want the easy access to strip action and the thrill of Las Vegas I‚Äôd suggest you to stay at Caesars. But for the price I‚Äôd much prefer to stay at Cosmopolitan or Encore for comfort.
40,Very friendly and helpful staff. Also had a great time playing the slots and seeing a show. The casino was clean and there was someone at all times cleaning and picking up empty drinks. Also the concert was in a great venue upstairs.
50,We had a really comfortable stay at Caesars Palace although everything was ridiculously expensive. We're used to travelling in South East Asia where you at least get a bottle of complimentary water each day but that wasn't the case here. I guess that's the strip for you! Check in/out was seamless at the auto-machines and the room was spotless. Lots of things to see and do at the resort with central and easy access to both sides of the strip. Compared to many of the other hotels probably also one of the better planned pick up zones for taxi's and ubers. The only feedback I'd have to say was that our air-con was very loud and sometimes you could smell the grill from the Buchanal buffet kitchens as our room was right on top of it.
50,I cannot express enough how amazing this whole facility is! Everything from shopping eating and gambling. Everyone is so friendly and polite. They go out of their way to make you happy. Will definitely be returning to enjoy this place many more times!
50,Great stay. Clean hotel. Nice rooms. Sophia P at VIP check was very nice and friendly. The only inconvenience was the valet service during rush hour. The taxis take up a whole lane and its easy to get caught in that taxi line. More lighting on signs would be nice too
50,I‚Äôm an existing member in various platinum and titanium classes for multiple worldwide hotel chains and staying at the Caesar‚Äôs Palace Las Vegas was in some cases far above the level of experienced at at brand name hotel chain. The room was beautifully appointed and close to anything I needed. The choices in meals was excellent. But the best part was the staff - everyone I came across to was warm and helpful. I look forward to my next stay!
10,4:45 room still not ready. 4 is checkin. Room type reserved not available. This place is bad news. Spent 1.5 hours on phone yesterday straightening out the room type they changed on me without notice. Apparently construction...whatever. You let people know.
30,Huge hotel perfect for Casino lovers good restaurants. Rooms are ok but we expected more for a 4 / 5 stars hotel : wifi in the rooms only for 2 items so if you need to connect 2 phones and one computer you have to pay (!!) very few amenities in the bathroom (one shampoo one conditionner and one shower gel) no hair dryer one towel per person... Room a bit old needs to b√© refreshed. Does not worth the price we paid...
50,Great location and services for the marathon! Also enjoyed the Seinfeld show that weekend as well. The best thing was the spa services we used right after our race. We will definitely be back next year!
50,Came for 1 week Siemens sales conference. Great venue for both business and fun. Sooyeon at checkin was friendly helpful and genuine. Very good employee for Caesars to be proud of. Thank you for the great hospitality. Will definitely return back soon.
50,Excellent the staff was very friendly. Ceaser is a beautiful place. They took care of us and have a great view of the Bellagio fountains. The staff in the casino was a lot of fun at the blackjack table. Keep up the good work and I will be coming back to Ceaser again.
20,The good old days of friendly customer service are over. We initially tried to check in a few hours early at the kiosk but they wanted to charge us $40. We tried to ask at the check in desk given we were two very pregnant ladies and clearly they had rooms available but got the same story...he made it sound like it was going to be a lot of extra work to give us a different room. Really $40 extra??? I have never heard a hotel charge for early check in when rooms are available! When we finally got our room the room furniture looks 30 years old. The cabinetry is all scratched up and bed sheets ragged (see photos). There is no booklet/binder with the hotel amenities like pool and gym hours. The clock was blinking midnight. a couple years ago I stayed at Aria for $50 less and had much better service including chocolates left on our pillow!
50,Me and my wife wanted to explore Vegas. We stayed in the Ceasars Palace... When we arrived the staff was very friendly and the location was right on the strip. All the hotel from the rooms to the casinos were amazing. Very clean and had a blast... We enjoyed the casino as well as the night life... Over all experience was wonderful... would recommend to family and friends.. Looking forward to our next trip.
50,Joselyn assisted with our check in and was great. She was very courteous and genuine. In addition the room was ready even though it was early in the morning. Will definitely stay at Caesars Palace on our next visit.
50,Had a great time and employees are fun and interactive. Enjoyed the whole experience from the table games to the sports book to the restaurants and bars on site. Right in the middle of the strip which allows you to visit multiple areas.
50,Went for my 21st birthday and had a great experience. Restaurants were all great hardly ever had to leave the hotel. Won lots in the casino bartenders were attentive. Great experience overall. Would recommend.
50,Stayed here for one night as part of a longer weekend Vegas trip.    Check-in  There is a separate checkin lounge for Diamond and Seven Stars members. We were directed to the lounge and greeted by four check-in representatives. Clarae helped us with the check-in process. We asked if there were any complimentary upgrades during our stay and were initially told that for an up charge we could get an upgraded room. We declined and were advised that the room we had booked was not ready for check in yet (it was about 1pm). We asked if there were any other rooms ready and Clarae checked with the Inventory team. She advised the individual she spoke with that it was our first time staying at the hotel and it was just for a night. Inventory was able to find us a room and also upgrade us at the same time!  Clarae did an amazing job getting us checked in and did not give up on trying to get us the complimentary upgrade :)    Room  We got upgraded to a junior corner suite on a high floor of the Augustus tower (dont remember the exact floor but it was in the 30s). The room was amazing and the views were incredible.    When we walked into the room we first noticed a big closet to our left and then a spacious bathroom past the closet. As we made our way though a little hallway we entered the main suite area which included a king-sized bed a nice work desk and a corner couch. There was also a little fridge in the room.    The suite had two large windows on each side. One side had a southern view of the strip while the other had the northern side. It was a very nice room with unbeatable views of the Strip!    We had a really nice time staying at the Caesars Palace for our one night and would definitely stay at this hotel again in the future.    -Patrycja at The SaviTravel Journal
50,I did not stay at the hotel but next time consider to stay at Cesar Palace .I use to stay there but had unpleasant experience but is seems now service change a lot in better way.And casino staff is very knowledgeable.
50,Caesars Palace have the nicest biggest cleanest room. And overall service is the best at the Caesars Place They have the best form shops best restaurants and it‚Äôs always fun to play at the Caesars !!!
30,Caesars properties charge you resort fees even if you don't use what they are charging you for. Parking costs us money. The $55 buffet ends up being just over $60 with tax and while what is there is pretty top notch as buffets go there is no true salad bar only some salad type dishes. While crab legs and jumbo shrimp are in abundance oysters clams and muscles on the half shell are almost totally absent other that some very small clams with meat about the size of a couple large aspirins. The Italian area while it did have some pasta dishes lacked regular spaghetti and pesto and I dont remember seeing any lasagne or caprese salad........Machines were tight and didnt even tease us ..........
50,food and sport book and shopping also great skows all kinds of different food to choose from great shops to visit the skows have a great difference so there something for everyone have very good dice tables
30,The biggest complaint we had was the extreme costs for food and drink.  This is not the Vegas I remember. Too much emphasis placed on the bottom line. Given that most visitors to Vegas ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ‚Äú gamble (witness the empty seats at slots and game tables) the greedy owners made their money on rooms and food.
50,There was no problem everyone is very helpfull and very nice stated from checking in and checking out vallet and bell casino host casino server I would recomend ceasars palace to a friend and colleague
50,Caesars is the best hotel in las vegas great rooms impeccable service everything you need on the property can‚Äôt wait to return best casino best shows best dining location is perfect Lori delray beach fla
50,Clean room friendly employees variety of selection of restaurants close to other Caesar casinos variety of shows lots of slot machines nice if there will be complimentary drinks like coffee and water
50,Room was cozy breath taking view from window. Spacious bathroom sectional couch and a mini bar. Loved every aspect of the hotel casino 5 towers the eating spots and the whole staff that made my stay complete.
40,Staff and management were very friendly. Hotel was beautiful and very clean. Made the stay very welcoming.    Hotel is gorgeous beyond belief. The decore and sculptures are quite fascinating. Highly recommend visiting.
50,There is no doubt in heaven that expectations are high when you are going to Vegas and especially when you are booked in at Caesar Palace. The myth qnd the buzz is really Exciting and by far the breathtaking Palace is awsome. Just everything you can imagine and more.  And there is more. Much more. We were a group travelling on different arrival rimes and by coincidence we were all checked in by the same agent in the front desk. What an AMAZING WARM WELCOME and He made us feel great. Tomek was his name look for his name on the sign and know that you are in the best hands. They were all service and top friendly but when Tomek greets you on your second checkin it just makea you feel special. THANKS.  And rooms atmosphere and shopping are superworld class. A must in Vegas. Check.
50,It was a great stay myself and my sister who travle with me had a great stay we already plan to come back to Caesars this was a birthday trip for the both of us normally we tavel with our brother also who birthday is in novermber with my sister is on the firsthis on the fouth and mine is Oct. 18th he has pass away so myself alone with my sister travel and keep him with us in our hearts so thank you again I know if he were here it would be better
50,The room was exceptional. It was large and appropriately furnished. It was clean and fully stocked. The view was beautiful. The customer service was great and the staff was friendly. I will definitely be back!
50,Room was exceptionally clean and comfortable. Spacious bathroom and king beds slept nice. Personal assistance via text when we arrived thru Express Check-in (nice feature!!) I texted her for more pillows and towels and housekeeping showed up . . . pretty amazing service. Very relaxing. When you sleep in till noon in Vegas . . . accommodations are pretty stellar.
40,As Always the Caesars is Known for years is Exceptional luxury Hotel Not only for business but for pleasure as well you can also spend all your moneys in the amazing Forum Shops at the Caesar's Palace Forum.
50,Always amazing!!! Super delicious and worth the price. customer service and amazing tasting quality food!! Fresh juices amazing seafood!! We will always return here! Thank you Caesars Palace for amazing place.
50,Phenomenal service clean rooms and overall a great experience. The food choices were exactly what we were expecting. Whether it was a quick bite to eat or a lovely sit down dinner the staff were very polite in recommendating a location.
40,Love this place. Great service entertainment. Highly gonna recommend to friends and family. No problems with anything when I needed help on. Love this placed. Hail the great Caesar palace. Nice scene nice view
50,Ceasars is one of the finest properties in Las Vegas. Great rooms and restaurants. Ample gaming area and wonderful ambiance throughout the whole casino hotel. There is a fine lineup of entertainment and more on the way. There are restaurants for every taste and cost. We would highly recommend Ceasrs to any and all
50,Caesars Palace is truly a beautiful hotel that has splendid and magnificent architecture. The splendor and grandeur of this hotel is quite impressive. The size of the property is quite large so one should be ready to walk. The staff is friendly and I have always been very well treated. The rooms are very nice and quite comfortable. The pool area is beautiful with several pools and a nice decorum. This is my favorite hotel in all of Las Vegas.
50,We had brunch at Mesa Grill and the food and service was excellent. Great time was had. Our waitress was friendly and very knowledgeable. I had the blue cornmeal waffles and my friends had pumpkin soup steak and eggs. The bread/muffins were so yummy
50,very comfortable room great restaurants and stores. Service was great employees very attentive. will recommend to friends and family. We will be making another trip to this hotel in the near future.
40,The property was clean as it always is but starting off my trip by downgrading my room was not a great way to start my 5 day trip. And after gambling a substantial amount it seemed as if nobody really cared to reach out to correct the issue.
50,I stood in The Julius Towers I just love that tower because I gamble right down stairs and I feel safe and its eazy to get to my room after a concert or an all nighter of gambling plus the rooms are so comfortable and clean I very happy with the Julius Towers.
50,Our room was clean and had an okay view. The staff member at check in was helpful about combining our reservations and quick about it. The service in the Laurel Lounge always made sure we were taken care of and did it with a smile. The service in the casino came a little slower but they were pretty busy.
50,Caesars Palace has everything you need. Rooms are spacious and well decorated. Entertainment is top notch. Variety of restaurants. Many slots or tables available. For those who don‚Äôt gamble take a walk in the mall. No need to go anywhere else.
50,Everything was great i'm just filling in the blanks so I can get to 200 characters. The room was good the place was clean and I had everything I needed. The weather was great I wish I could have spent more time outside.
50,Everything was good just had to pay extra $30 to check in earlier since my flight was early enough that it didn't qualify for the check in. All in all the stay was good and the tier credits did not apply to me right away and until today.
50,Always enjoy the Caesars resort amenity with top rated restaurants. Having an OF at Searsucker is a tradition for us every time we are in Vegas. Searsucker has really good food to compliment the 4 different OF drinks on their menu.  The Caesars poker room always offer lively table. It is my place to play and relax.
50,My room the customer service and professionalism was outstanding. In addition allowing me options during my stay was a huge bonus. In addition to this review I will for sure be back to Cesars because of the outstanding Military support that is provided by Cesars.
50,This is my first time stay at Caesars everything was amazing! Start from the valet check in got into our room all smooth and quick.  Room was big(got an upgrade) and clean this hotel is massive like the Venetian you need to spend lots of time to walk around. I would definitely stay at Caesars again!
50,Best staff ever. Would highly recommend to my friends and family. Always paying attention to their guests very clean rooms and the nicest employees every. I can‚Äôt wait for my next trip to Las Vegas. Thank you!!!
50,Usually we stay next door at bellagio but this trip we decided to try Caesars.  Right from the start the front desk rep who checked us in DANIEL NELSON was fabulous! What a nice man! He took his time to accommodate us in explaining the availability room differences & answering our questions all with such a caring & genuinely happy attitude. First impressions mean a lot & Daniel really set the tone.  Our room 'Julius King Studio' was gorgeous.. bigger & classier than we expected. These rooms were renovated but to tell you the truth the room looked brand new. Also I would like to mention front desk Manager EVANDER. This gentleman did something very kind for us that was completely unexpected. Thank you Evander! Thanks Caesars you're a class act like no other. We had such a fun time staying with you. From here on in the Bellagio is 'out no more 86'ed'. CAESARS PALACE is where we will be staying. G.LoRusso
50,As always the keys to Caesars' success is the people. Two people who really stood out on this trip were Lee Houghton and Mike Alvarrez. Lee received his 45-year award when I was there and I have played on his tables many times throughout the years; he has a lot of heart and really cares about your satisfaction and does his best to make it a great experience for the players. Mike is a great manager as well in keeping with the Caesars tradition.
50,"If you are rated Diamond or Seven Star you must check out the Laurel Lounge at Caesars. Ask for ""Ana"" the best waitress I've ever met. Her warm smile is always present and she knows what I like! Special thanks to Shawn (supervisor) who now provides great food."
50,Rooms are clean staff is friendly and very helpful. This is one of my favorite hotels to stay when I am in Vegas! The restaurants are great! The business center is great if you are getting a package delivered or if you are waiting for a fax. The staff goes out of their way to help you. I like checking in on-line it's very convenient.
50,It was.perfect. no complaints. Employees took the time to be helpful and give detailed information. Always a great experience. I make it a point to go there everytime I am in the area. I enjoy myself everytime
40,My husband and I stayed there for Madonna concert. It was fine but in my opinion slots were tight but over all GOODTIMES..... GOODTIMES! More of a ‚Äúyouger‚Äù crowd. But all was well. Service was great & staff was attentive!
50,Ceasars Palace is a great place to stay. My husband and I loved the great service when we check in and when we check out. Our room was very very nice and spacious and it had a tremendous view of the swimming pools. The hotels has its own Food Court Starbucks and other very nice restaurants. The Sports Center is great if you are into sports. Smoking is allowed in this hotel but they must have good air ventilation system because most of the time did not bother me or my husband.
50,Caesars Palace Las Vegas is by far my favorite hotel to stay in every time I go to Las Vegas with my family or travel solo. Why? It‚Äôs because I am familiar with all the staffüòòSpecial mention are the staff at the Diamond Check in Sofia Wil Jay Lei Suki Annie Michelle Princess Susan Kellie...these beautiful people of CP always provided me a service with a smile and they will find a way to satisfy my request if available. I‚Äôm also happy with the service Joselyn of the front desk provided one time I check in really early as Diamond Check in was still close that time. Caesar Palace is my second home away from home because of their excellent customer service. Raymona and Lisa At the Diamond lounge also displays awesome customer service. Room has more space than other hotel. Housekeeping staff were great and always attentive to my every request. Thank you all for the extra ordinary hospitalityü•∞ü•∞ü•∞Till we meet again!!!
50,The Diamond Lounge (now called Laurel Lounge) at Caesars is our favorite at all off the Caesars Rewards properties. Richard and Rick are awesome! We stay and go to Caesars because of those 2. They are very fun and entertaining. I have met so many people from different parts of the County because of them and how they introduce you to others in the lounge. The rest of the staff at the Lounge are great as well. Caesars should be proud of the group they have put together.
30,We celebrated 40th wedding anniversary. Even though they were well aware before our arrival (due to emails from concierge a few months prior) there was no acknowledgement by the hotel. A simple note in our room would have been nice. We should have stayed somewhere else. The room was very pricey and not worth it. They nickle and dime you too. Why put a keurig coffee machine in room and then charge $12 for 3 pods? Mostly I wish they would have acknowledged our anniversary. 40 years is special and other anniversaries at other properties have been very accommodating to honor our anniversary. We will not return to Caesars for future celebrations!
40,This place was in the middle of the city easily found from the road. Very convenient to reach from airport and ample parking space is a there  however parking is little costly. Also if you are a diamond member  I think parking is free. Coming to the architecture the place looks magnificent from inside out. They have around 4000 rooms with conference halls  multi cuisine restaurants and of course a very big casino with multiple options. Coming to the room  we stayed at palace towers with a view towards the pool. Room was clean and comfortable. However to my surprise everything was reall little different. The mini bar was expensive as expected however they charge you even if you keep your things inside. Also the Wifi connection is only for two devices anything more is charged. Coming to coffee maker I f we use it it‚Äôs charged separately. As there is multiple food options inside the hotel we were comfortable with all these. The staff was good considering the amount of people they have to attend to  its understandable. Also if you are not a diamond or platinum member they are least bothered I believe. Overall if you are in Vegas and you want to spend some good money this is the best place. And knowing that The mall is just walkable from your room it‚Äôs good place for shopping. Considering all these if you are in Vegas I highly recommend you to visit this place even if you can‚Äôt afford to stay here. Other than rooms everything else is accessible to anyone who came for shopping or casino. It‚Äôs a great way to experience a completely different place which is far away from USA while you are in Vegas. Also don‚Äôt miss the water show at Atlantis. It‚Äôs played every hour from morning 11am. Also the near by hotel has a very big fountain outside where there is a magnificent water show happening every thirty minutes. Not sure from what time it starts though. You should surely catch up during the evening or night as sunset is pretty early there.
50,We had a Ball last year at a other hotel it was horrible the service was crap ! This year we had it at Caesars palace It was a mazing !! The service was outstanding and the Ball room was Gorgeous !! I would like to thank the employees and the event service for making this experience great!! As most of those man just came home from deployment!
50,Awesome room and service was outstanding. This is the place to stay in Vegas. There were no issues during the stat and customer service was as good as it gets. I will only stay at this property in the future if and when I return to Vegas.
50,Love Caesars Palace this time it was the base for the Marathon in which my daughter was running. Everyone was so helpful and friendly in the hotel and our room was stunning. As Arnie would say we will be back! Thanks
50,I had a great visit rooms are very clean and spacious housekeepers always on time. Front desk is very helpful as well as the security guards. I had surgery and couldn't walk the strip I was able to rent a scooter.
50,I arrived 3 days ahead of my husband for our week long timeshare near here . I had a very nice relaxing stay and as usual was treated very well they even sent a bottle of champagne to my room! I of course did some gambling even won a jackpot while here. As usual the restarant meals I had at Ceasars were also 5 star!
50,I like Caesars Palace because the roomy room always clean throughout the property  shopping area and food court for all ages and all budgets. My favorites slot machines are there and I love the concerts
50,Caesar's Palace is the number one place to go in Vegas. Everyone treats you like royalty and the amenties are the best.  great shopping dining and shows. Always something going on for the entire family
10,For the second time visiting Caesar resorts the room we reserved from the website was not the room we were given. We were looking forward to the amazing upgrades but were ultimately placed in the older rooms. So disappointing when we have spent several years accruing points only to settle for less. Our New Years plans for Vegas are definitely on hold.
50,Room was superb. Tons of options for food gaming and entertainment! I will for sure be returning to the property for future stays. My only complaint would be the price of room service it was extremely pricey.
50,The location of this hotel is great the casino and it's staff are excellent. The hotel rooms are excellent and the hotel itself has great restaurants and shopping. I've stayed at many places in Las Vegas but always go back to Caesars Palace.
50,We had a wonderful free room offer and complimentary show tickets. We saw Jerry Seinfeld and were very pleased with our seats and the show. We upgraded to a signature suite and found it to be very comfortable and well decorated. The bed was great. The gambling wasn't great for us but that can happen anytime!
50,Great place but getting rewards points are way way too difficult.    I lost over 4k but still didn't get anything comped  Don't get me wrong. It was a great trip but I didn't get anything comped .    Please feel free to contact me if you have questions
50,Everything was fantastic! I enjoyed the shops casino restaurants shows and the friendly and courteous staff. Caesars is the place to be when in Vegas. I will only stay at Caesars Palace whenever I am in Las Vegas.
50,Always a great time at Caesars Palace! Great atmosphere and the slots machines are always friendly!    We went to the Madonna concert and the venue was great and they employees were very friendly and it was well organized! Easy access time your seats.
20,My husband and I booked a premium room with a King bed and I did the early check in online 24 hours before our stay.    At the counter the check in clerk stated that a King bed room was not available instead he would get us a room with 2 queen beds. I said that was fine. He then stated all that was available was the lowest floor on the Augustus tower which was the pet friendly floor. He assured that the rooms and halls were cleaned thoroughly and asked if we were okay with this. My mistake is accepting the room.    When we got to our room I saw a dead cricket in the corner of the room which can be easily found upon entering the room bed runners at the foot of the bed were covered in pet fur. I understand that this is a pet friendly floor but cleanliness should still be a factor. Me being too nice I decided to not complain and let it go. When I checked the bathroom I found out that the shower had no partition so when you showered water would get all over the floor. It was super inconvenient for us. Clerk failed to inform us that this room was a handicap room.    I let that all go and decided to just enjoy the trip regardless of the situation. On our second night the bathroom sink got clogged no hair had fallen into sink. It was just used to wash hands with regular water and soap. I texted concierge and asked them to have someone come up and fix it and if possible clean the room.    Concierge said they would not clean up the room because we opted out of room service. I stated my complaints about the room and asked if they can at least clean the room to make up for the issues for the room. Instead they told me to go down to the lobby and talk to the manager. This hotel is very inconsiderate and not good with customers. Instead of offering an upgrade for the downgraded room or any type of complimentary ticket items they turn down cleaning the room.
50,Our room was very spacious with 2 queen beds full sized sofa table and two chairs. The bathroom had a large vanity with 2 sinks jetted tub large shower and a separate toilet area. All toiletry essentials were provided. The room was very clean and extremely comfortable.
50,We didn‚Äôt stay at any Caesars property this trip but do almost every time we come to Las Vegas. The Caesars properties are always clean and easy to get in and out of. Plus most of the hotels are located in the middle of the strip and easy to walk wherever you might need to go.
50,We had a great time while in Vegas. It was our first time staying at Caesar‚Äôs Palace but definitely not out last. Everything was really easy- Patrick checked us in and he was awesome our room was clean and spacious and everything we needed was downstairs.
50,Great Hotel! Forum shops have great shopping Drink service in the casino was great. Coffee makers in the room an added benefit. We stayed in the Augusta tower newly renovated great view of the fountains.
30,surprises at extra charge for early check in--taxes (which we thought were already included in package--all SEVEN pools were closed at the casino during our stay--requested 4 extra hangers to three different personnel which we never got--very poor directions to an excursion we purchased--cousins were to be on the same floor as us but were told they had to wait another 2 hours then were put into a filthy room which was later corrected by putting them in another room 5 floors above us and their room never got cleaned before 4 pm each day
50,This is one of my favorite places to stay on the strip because of the friendly staff huge casino and many food locations in walking distance. You are also right by the link in high roller which is a fun excursion to go on.
40,Great place to stay. I had a fountain view room which was excellent. The rooms are spacious and the beds are so comfortable. It is centrally located close to many eating places and wonderful shopping. A wonderful place to stay.
50,Top hotel casino and dining in my opinion. I was there for a convention and then a few extra days with family. Work or pleasure it is a great experience. Everything was very classy. All types of dining/pricing was available. Located in the center of the strip it's easy to get anywhere even by foot.
50,Stayed in one of the 2 story suites. Views up and down the strip. Rooms were a little dated but very comfortable - especially the beds and showers. Location on the strip was perfect for walking around and getting a sense of the Vegas flavor. Getting the car from valet each day was automated and could not be easier. Employees were generally very nice and helpful. Rao's is a must visit! Plenty of food and shopping options in the hotel. In Vegas they try to make it so you don't have to or want to leave the property and Caesars has done a great job with this.
50,We had a great time at the Flamingo. We found the check in to be very well run and not complicating. The room was very comfortable and clean. Every morning the room was made up to my satisfaction. The elevators were very quick to get to your floor at all times.  Being a non smoker I was uncomfortable but that goes for all the casinos.  I enjoyed my breakfast at the buffet but would have liked to have later hours of service for dinner.  It was easy to find way out to the In and Out Burger place just outside the Flamingo.  It was easy to go out on Strip to see the sights and enjoy the Fountain Show near-by.  We had a very easy time at checkout. The taxi stand was operated ver well. The wait was minimal and the people were very professionable.
50,My room was a smoking room but the staff had it clean and smoke smelling clean. Always correctly cleaned and neat. Room service was alerted that we were diamond members and had our order to us quickly. The buffet was excellent as always and the service quick.
50,I love Caesar's always have. Stayed many times and the rooms are beautiful and big. So many restaurants and foodie places. Lots of options for music and drink. Clean and classic. Love this hotel. I will stay here again.
50,Caesars Palace is terrific. The location is perfect and our Augustus tower strip-view room was extravagantly appointed (marble bathroom glass shower stall and water-jet bathtub). The front desk service was top drawer. We did a late check-in (9pm) with Xavier Macias at the front desk who was gracious and informative. Xavier gave us a great room (4284) with the view of Paris and the Bellagio fountains. Quiet room comfortable beds. A terrific stay and highly recommended.
40,Rooms were super nice. Caesars reward host are awesome. Great service. New tower great. Upgraded rooms. Hard to enter. Room service is awesome. Great service. check in was bad. No online check in so had to wait in long lines.
40,I was here for my seven star celebration and they kept charging things that were suppose to be complimentary. I had to constantly go back to customer service to fix my charges throughout the trip. I suggest you know what‚Äôs you‚Äôre covered for so that you don‚Äôt get charge for things that you shouldn‚Äôt be charged for.
50,Poker room @ Caesars staff are very professional & friendly excellent costumers service. Room is ok but will be much better if enclosed so there is less noise from slot machines & sports book area noise as well as less smoke coming from these places.
50,Everything was beautiful and the staff was so helpful and friendly. Our room was beautiful with the shower and jacuzzi tub and the marble was beautiful. The shopping section was wonderful. The staff was very informative and helpful about any situation.
50,Love the reward system people are down to earth and relatable. Had a great room not far from the elevator that was easy to access with a great view! Great location to everything in the area and very centralized on the strip.
50,Great hotel friendly staff we went for a show and dinner and everything was perfect. The staff from the hotel are very helpful and friendly they make you feel welcome. They have great restaurants and great concerts at the Coliseum
40,Room was nice but the goodies and bar is far to expensive and not very friendly. From the comments at check in bar Bar process was all negative.. We didn't want to touch it. You would be better off with a free coffee bar and a small refrigerator for customers. My wife likes a tub but we have never had a room with one.
50,Tried 5-star destination for the first time. And it was very nice in all possible ways.    Although I will not come back anywhere in the near future. I am just not that high maintenance to make it worth the extra $$$.    So all in all. A great experience but not enough extra bang for the buck for me as I don't spend that much time in the room anyway.
50,Had a great trip from start to finish. Quick check-in and free upgraded room at that time! Great meals and plenty of great dealers at all tables made losing money OK as crazy as that sounds although in the end winning saved the day! Great entertainment during my 3.5 day stay. Couldn't ask for more
40,It was my first time staying at Caesars so I did not know what to expect. I was upgraded to a suite when I checked in (I am a Caesars Awards Platinum member) so that was a nice surprise. The room was clean and spacious and I opted out of cleaning and got a $10 food credit. The hotel is extremely large and does take some getting used to when finding things. The signs can be a bit confusing so I just did a lot of trial and error. There is a food court all the way towards the back of the property (close to the Forum Shops) which does provide an inexpensive meal selection. They were quick and accurate and had a good variety. Otherwise there are plenty of more expensive dining options! I attended a work convention and it is a bit tricky to navigate the convention hallways. There were 3-4 other conventions going on at the same time so it made finding my classes a bit trickier. Just make a few practice runs and you'll be fine. Gambling was good. (Didn't win anything) There were plenty of games to choose from and I had no problems getting on a machine. Tables were very busy so I didn't even venture close to them! Casino was VERY clean and there seemed to be machine attendants around all the time if you had any issues. Security was always visible so I never felt unsafe. Room service had a long delay so I opted not to do that. Overall It was a good experience. I would probably not stay with my family but I would stay with my husband or by myself if I came back for work.
40,Visited the casino and to shop - none of the a lot machines we played were winning even the smallest dollar amounts. The shops were nice and had beautiful and unique items. The Atlantic show was entertaining but a bit long.
10,At front desk checking in they were very rude and racist. In room kea did not work .The room was not ready.Security did not show up at all. Call number at front desk never work.  Room was much far and booking people did not booked right room
50,Caesars Palace is the place to stay in Las Vegas! Staff is friendly and very accommodating! The location is right in the center of it all! You will not be disappointed! Highly recommend staying here!!
50,Great customer service loved playing in the casino. Won as well!! Drinks were great the scenery was beautiful employees are so nice and restaurants are very good. Would really stay here again when I get the chance.
50,Had a very comfortable room overlooking the Strip. A Jacuzzi in the bathroom. All of the employees of the Hotel very friendly courteous and helpful.I enjoyed myself and felt relaxed and refreshed when I got home
50,From the moment I arrived the Rooms and service was top notch anything I needed they were there to answer any questions . I will definitely be coming back again from moment to end great place def book your next stay here at Caesars palace
50,It was a fun trip and Caesars does not disappoint. Rooms were clean staff is always helpful and we had a great time and gained a little weight during the process. We brought our young adult kids and they stayed across the street and I felt dirty when I left there. Next time I will fork out the extra bucks and have them stay at Caesars!
50,Our stay at Caesars was great. The service cleanliness and amenities were great. The staff worked very hard and were attentive to our needs. We will definitely go back as well as recommend to friends
40,The staff was great. The rooms were very clean on a daily basis. Really nice reception from the diamond registration people. Food was great. Excellent service at all three of the bars located on the property. Just an overall wonderful experience.
50,If you are in Las Vegas Caesars Palace us a must to go place. Not only it is one of the most luxury hotel casino here you can also spend days in the amazing shipping mall. If you like photos the ancient Roman architecture in the front entrance is a very nice background for your pictures.
40,We decided to stay at Caesars Palace due to not staying on the other side of the strip. We stayed for 4 nights two nights being compensated.  We reserved the king room deluxe in the Julius tower. We checked in and asked if we wanted to pay extra for room upgrades. We didn‚Äôt because the room wasn‚Äôt that important to us. We arrived to the hotel around 3:30. Check in was at 4. We were told the room wasn‚Äôt ready and will send a text when it is. We were told it would be about a hour and a half. That was annoying. Luckily we waited an hour and at 4:30 the text came through that the room was ready. We went to get our keys asked again if we wanted to pay for any room upgrades. That was the annoying part.  The room was fine. Room looked out onto the pool which was closed but that‚Äôs fine. The bathroom had 2 sinks and the showe! The shower had the best water pressure of all the hotels we‚Äôve stayed at. It was awesome.  I loved how they had a coffee pot in the room. It was rare to fine one. Luckily I read the rooms had one so came prepared with K Cups.  The casino was fine just like the others. Would I stay there again? Yes.
50,We stayed in the Agustus tower (very close to checkin and our room was close by the elevator). The room was large with king bed and sitting area with sofa. We took the no housekeeping for $10 credit (found out it's 10 for the stay vs. 10/night when i checked out).  We'll be back!
50,Starting from my host Andrew Edrosa to our registration attendant in the diamond check in office - Meka. My stay from beginning to end was exemplary. Andrew scheduled reservation was quick and very easy to acquire. Mesa was very receptive to our registration needs and quickly adaptive to some changes we required during our check in process. As long as Andrew remains as my host I will plan to visit Ceasars monthly. Thank you for the wonderful accommodations as always
50,It's been a few years since the last time I stayed but the hotel looks better than ever. We came on a business trip and the convention center is massive and sometimes hard to navigate with several conventions taking place at the same time but being able to enjoy the hotel at the end of the day was well worth it.
50,The place to go to. Elegant. Connected to the mall in the Forum casino. Easy access to restaurants and coffee shjops.Good access to taxis . Good video poker and blackjack.Will rteturn in a few months.
10,The tack on of all the paperwork xtra service fees and taxes was acceptable when the casino hotel and city was a top notch experience. This city is filthy. The homeless are increasing both in numbers drug induced stupor and their aggressiveness to women and children passing by on the sidewalk of the strip. The casino and hotel are loosing their splendor and the smoking of cigarettes/marijuana in the open is absolutely sickening. Good bye Vegas for good.
10,Just checked out. We never received the room that I booked with a king size bed. Was put in a cheaper priced tower with no apologies or credit. Resort fee is high and pool is closed. Charge guests for parking but don‚Äôt indicate that at check in what price is. Managers not helpful. Much better hotels on the strip.
50,This is one of my favorite hotels on the strip. The service is great the casino and rooms are clean and the buffet here is a must! The pools are nice too. Great for summer time trips. Really enjoyed my stay.
50,In for a 2 day turnaround. Ate at 2 restaurants on property. Homestead was outstanding. Excellent 16 Oz. Ribeye. Oscar. Very tight quarters. Also ate at Rao's. Brooklyn Italian feel. Crab Carbonara an excellent choice. Room comfortable. Very pleasant quick getaway.
30,Room overall was very nice. Bed was high and difficult to get into. Furniture was mostly soft and low and difficult to rise from. I put 2 cushions on one chair to make it higher. Bathroom with roll in shower was good. When we drove in I went to a special high roller entrance in error where they rejected me. Not nice and not appreciated by me as an older person driving after dark and not familiar with the hotel etc
50,No but it is much better. Great customer service rooms large clean the 2 bathrooms in out unit was life saving! Palace Tower elevators are fast with little or no waiting. Great choice of restaurants.
50,Caesars Palace is the best hotel and we always stay there whenever we trip to Vegas. Room was nice and the housekeeping were so wonderful. All the restaurant service was excellent. Spa and the gym was amazing.
50,The room was so excellent . . Very clean & received good services Had a beautiful strip view as well . Everything was so easy to get around .to. If you are looking for a nice relaxing hotel  any Ceasars property will work for you . You will be glad you did!
50,The room was amazing so much bigger than I expected and so roomy. I was here with my boyfriend for the Marine Corps Ball and the hotel was great. The event was perfect in the ballroom at the hotel and I really enjoyed all aspects. The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful and I like it the best out of the others on the strip! I 100% recommend staying here when you travel to vegas. Beautiful restaurants and casino. Such a great atmosphere!
50,Las Vegas weather is spectactular in the fall and Caeser's Palace is the best place to experience it with great service great food and friendly staff. Will definitely go back when get the chance to do so.
40,Nice clean place in Vegas. Food options were spectacular! Walking distance to major attractions. Staff was very attentive. Taxi line was short and monorail was a short walk through Flamingo. All in all nice place to relax in Vegas.
40,This place is exceptionally nice. Resort fees are rip offs. I just wished they would put them in the actual price. Its CAESERS PALACE for crying out loud. People will pay. Instead your charged for bottled water you don't drink a gym you don't use housing keeping (which I opted out of) etc. Resort fees are so misleading and I hope their outlawed. With that said the place is nice. The drinks are outrageously expensive the tune of like $20 for a Jack & Coke. The staff is friendly but firm. It can be crowded at times this is a given....its Caesars Palace. If you plan to gamble I suggest gambling elsewhere if you don't like high minimums. Roulette is $25 outside and $25 inside. That's $50 a play if you play both. $75 if you play 2 to 1 as well. But I did like the atmosphere. Plan to get coffee early unless you want to stand in line for an hour. I gambled a bit here but once I was down went to 4 Queens to finish up since their minimums are $5 outside and inside. Caesars Palace is a real nice place to stay just understand these things.
50,We enjoyed the nice spacious clean rooms and friendly service. Dealers were friendly. loved the coffee to go place by the front door! Public Bathrooms were clean! Pool was closed for the season bummer!
30,i like caesars always stay there when visit las vegas near to sands expo.  nice room nice service good buffet  slat machine is good table game is soso need add more black jack  service need more improvement.
50,Just went to the Montecristo Cigar Bar. Great place!!!!! Drinks were great and we played Jacks or better most of the day. Make sure you see Jason behind the bar. This guy is great!!! Dont forget to try the smoked drink. With a cigar you cant beat it!
40,Check in is efficient; rooms are well-maintained; staff friendly and helpful; Several top restaurants. Tip: Get a map of the layout of casino to assist navigating the place. It is quite large with different sections.
50,This hotel is always busy with lots of excitment going on all the time. The staff are always friendly and the food is incredible. We stay in the Octavius tower all the time and the room is always clean and the staff always acoomodating.  THis hotel is one of the best in the city.
50,Excellent vacation spot A good place to get away from it all play a little bit and see some wonderful shows go to events outside the hotel lije SEMA Will be back next year to do it all over again and to bring more friends to join me
20,I stayed in November in Suite 3084. The menu was stained and not replaced furniture was badly scratched and there was something wrong with the piping as bad smells came from the sinks. But to top it off they did not make the room. So after a grueling day in Las Vegas my family came back to an unmade room no fresh towels garbage in the bins etc... Head of housekeeping should be more involved and supervise what their underlings are doings. One job and they don‚Äôt get it right. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be coming back to Cesar‚Äôs Palace.    The view from the room was great. That‚Äôs salvageable.
40,Pros:  1) It's beautiful. The sculptures and decor are very high class.  2) Staff is friendly and surprisingly fun.  3) The location is near the center of the strip and makes for good walking distance to nearly any other place on the strip.  4) They have some shops and even if you're not interested in buying something take a walk around. It's beautiful.    Cons:  1) I would think a casino worth so much money would have a heated pool so guests can enjoy the equally stunning courtyard/pool area in the winter but they don't.  2) It's a little pricey even for Vegas. My room was $380 for a double queen for 1 night. Something like $45 was due to resort fees and again the pool wasn't even open. If you have the option i would go without the resort part of it in the winter time. You will also lose Wi-Fi though.  3) They have a good variety and they have 3 main groups of machines spread out over the very large casino floor but something about it still seems to be missing for me it feels like the amount of actual slot machines is on the low side... but I can't put my finger on it.
50,This was our first visit and stay at Ceasars Palace. Loved that you could enter Ceasars and go in various directions walk thru hotel casino and shopping all in one place. The noise level on a Friday and Saturday night can get pretty loud and the crowds large. Felt safe while there and staff at front desk and on the floor were very hospitable and accommodating.
50,I stay in the Augustus tower and the room was clean large and comfortable. My view was over the Bellagio fountain. I was able to workout and spa on the 2nd floor which made it so convenient. The spa and gym was first class.
40,Caesars like most of the casinos is huge! You will walk alot. The staff is eager to help you 24/7. Our room was nice and the beds are PERFECT! Make sure to visit the gym and spa. Great food and entertainment around every corner.
50,Every time I been to Caesar palace it was an amazing visit no matter if I won or lost it‚Äôs a nice place to go to. Hills kitchen was an awesome place to go eat at and get to experience the quality of the food.
50,enjoyed my day there and the food and gambling didn't stay overnight but would love to sometime the mall is great and all the choices for eating always good entertainment and plenty to see and do..will be back
50,My wife and I had a wonderful experience at Ceasar‚Äôs Palace in November 2019. Great food and service at the buffet; crap and roulette tables. Everyone was courteous and helpful at the gaming tables. Would recommend in a heartbeat.
50,Place is excellent place to stay eat and gamble. It‚Äôs centrally located in the middle of the strip. The rooms are clean and have great views of the fountain of the Bellagio. Many great places to eat and shop as well.
50,great room and food. had a good time and enjoyed the food and games. The new interactive slots are fun. The mall is fun to walk. We enjoyed the ambiance. The Dianne Warwick show in the Cleopatra barge was wonderfull.
50,The room was very excellent and the service. I will referre my friends and family to come to visit. I will come back again because the Caesars Palace have very excellent rooms and service there I recommend this to people and thank you!
50,We had their LUNCH BUFFET yesterday & it was awesome. For four of us it costed USD 113/- but every penny is worth. What an amazing spread everything served very hot tasty & still lingering in mouth. Being some of us Vegetarians but still we had so many options & could not try everything. Wonderful experience & highly recommended.
50,Great Poker room and atmosphere. Entire casino clean and upbeat. Staff very friendly restrooms clean tables busy and fun. Loved the layout of the sports book but found cost to rent section pricey but overall really good environment
50,Great strip view perfect view of the Bellagio water showclose to elevators and ice machine. Great service at the food court and great cocktail service at the slot machines valet service is always prompt.
50,Ceasars is always a great experiene when in Las Vegas. Convenience in dinning shopping transportation and property are always exceeptional.  Any time we are headed to Las Vegas Ceasars is the place to stay and play.
50,From the second we stepped inside we were in awe of the hotel. Beautiful place.  I was fortune enoyght to be checked in by Delano who was THE nicest person ever. We were given an amazing room with an AMAZING view! He made our experience that much better!
50,Great customer service starting at front desk organized big rooms kept super clean . Food at Bucchanal buffet was excellent.celebrating my birthday and we had a great time . Is our second time staying here everything is walking distance just love it
50,Booking hotel over the phone is easy. I needed 2 nights of stay and Caesars was packed with no rooms left on my first night. Customer service helped in getting one night stay in Plant Hollywood and the other night in Caesars. Caesars has the best architecture and very clean. Online check-in and check-out is easy. Highly recommend this Hotel.
50,Visited Caesars Palace for three nights. The Augustus Tower is an exceptional experience: close to the spa and the Diamond Lounge and Diamond check-in room.  Dined at Giadas at Cromwell: also a Caesars property (Cromwell). Have eaten at all of Caesars Palace restaurants and enjoyed every one of them.  The amenities at the hotel and the Augustus Tower rooms remain consistently good and I would recommend this property without hesitation.
50,CAESARS is a GREAT place to stay they are ALWAYS attentive to my every needed. The people who are working there ALWAYS greet you with positive and helpful tips. No stone is left unturned  i am ALWAYS treated with respect give help and enjoy being in this positive clean and wonderful environment
10,Our trip didn‚Äôt start off very well as the check in process and folks we worked with were both horrible. Opted out of room service and was told we would have a $10 credit for each room that we could use for food or entertainment which was supposed to be taken off at checkout did not happen. Billing was incorrect and rewards program is awful. We will not be back at a Ceasars establishment. We had a group of 9 for a birthday and no one had a good experience.
40,Augustus tower room was very nice. Employees are very competent and helpful. The problem I have with Caesars property is the exceptionally high food and drink prices throughout. Really did not purchase much there except two dinners (Rao's and Homestead steak house) which were very good but pricey. We found it less expensive to eat and drink off the property. Still love to stay at Caesars!
50,Great place to visit and experience! Need to walk around and visit all parts and you will love your stay! Pool is gorgeous hotel is fabulous employees are great and it is definitely an experience you will never forget!
50,Great atmosphere variety of food selections and spectacular room for the money. There was plenty of gaming options with reasonable table limits during a holiday weekend. All the food options were great and they had an affordable food court open extremely late so I wasn‚Äôt stuck with limited room service options. I will certainly return.
50,outstanding rooms clean and had a great view. Had room service gentle was very nice. I wil referral everyone to go to ceases love to stay Ceaser had stayed numerous times. Even the hosts were outstanding
50,The rooms are always immaculate when I stay at Caesars. I did have excellent service for the room and the area was very quiet. When I stay with Caesars the check in area is well staffed so check in is speedy--
50,Caesars Palace is the perfect Las Vegas stay if you want affordable luxury and to be pampered by a hospitality staff that actually makes you feel like royalty. The hotel is so self contained and located within walking distance to the connected great choice of restaurants and shopping we never really leave the building.
30,Older Casino with the illusion that they have quick check in procedures. However the Kiosk did not work and the staff did not care. It is a nice place but the staff needs encouragment to please their customers. Room view was ther top of a building and other balconies. Nothing to see.
40,The hotel room is very large - the hotel itself is HUGE with plenty to do and plenty of places to eat. However it is unbelievable that Caesar's while they have a coffee maker in the room charges $15 to use the coffee pods (pack of 4)! Also the fridge is strictly for the minibar - there is a $75 charge if you store any personal items in there. This for me is unacceptable. The room cost is so high yet you charge for everything?!? Other than those issues my stay was very pleasant.
30,The hotel itself is beautiful and on everyone‚Äôs wish list to visit. However the pools are closed in November but the hotel still charges full price resort fees. When I asked I was told the fees were for the fitness centre and local phone calls. Seriously who makes local calls on hotels phones especially when the handset was not charged and I had to text the front desk. Prime example of hidden fees. Very disappointing and we will not stay there again.
40,This was my first time in Las Vegas and Caesars gave me a great experience.  I stayed here with a few friends for my birthday weekend. I am not a big gambler but I honestly chose this place for their pool /location. We stayed in the Octavius tower and it was closely located to the pool entrance. This complex is so giant and you can easily get lost. I would come back here again for sure!
50,People go above the norm to help you. Great view from our room. Lots to do and look at. Love the poker room non smoking is a big plus in my book. The have cash games and to tournaments which is my favorite they have a guaranteed payout that not everybody offers. Love to also play at the craft tables dealers are very helpful pit bosses are friendly and it makes an enjoyable time. The cocktail waitresses are always asking you for cocktails with super service I love that the facility is so clean people are always cleaning things which is very nice. I plan to go back next month and have another good time. The security seems to be very concerned about your well-being and there‚Äôs plenty of them standing around very helpful to me when I asked him a question he put me in the right direction. I like the fact that there are so many choices with the Caesars group you can go to several different casinos restaurants not a show person myself but they‚Äôre available. My wife likes the fact that she can do a lot of shopping with many different shops all close together. There again she feel safe because there is security and she doesn‚Äôt have to feel intimidated by walking by yourself .
50,I like the way the hotel is laid out and with the mall it keeps the wife happy. Awesome staff and very helpful. Great Casino with some different games like the Free Bet Blackjack. I loved the massage I received while playing Blackjack!
30,First off our stay was good. It did not wow us in any way. Our room was clean and the cleaners did a great job. I slept well in room. Everyone was friendly. However the front desk employees during check in and check out seemed so blah. You might as well just use the kiosk.  The reason I will not stay at this hotel the ventilation in the lobby/ casino is horrible. I understand that it is an old hotel but so were others we walked in. We walked to all the major hotels on the strip and most were great. Every time I walked into Caesars my eyes were very dry and sore immediately. The smoke is horrible. I had to take allergy pills it was so painful. We spent most of our time at the Mirage and Venetian because I couldn‚Äôt handle it. For this reason I am sorry but we won‚Äôt be back.
40,It is excellent to enjoy clean rooms restaurants and location but work around such huge place to look around. It seems to me that food cost was so high to afford it. We wish there are places like food court which is much cheaper places
50,We were checked in quickly. We stayed in the Palace Tower. The room was very clean. The beds were very comfortable. The staff was very friendly. The refrigerator in the room was so full of beer and such that I had a hard time putting my insulin in. We would stay here again.
50,Was in Vegas to go to the Madonna concert. Booked a room and signed up for the Ceasar's rewards program. Did the express check in and found we had to wait for our room. After waiting for about a half an hour I checked with the desk staff who let me know I could check in now. They also let me know I was upgraded. Wow! We received a large suite which way exceeded my expectations. I called room service for an extra blanket and it was delivered in under 5 minutes. The whole experience was amazing!
20,"I booked a Julius Luxury Suite (Signature Level) about 4 MONTHS IN ADVANCE for $475 per night (plus fees/taxes) rather than a strip view room in the Augustus tower for about $250 per night. When we finally arrived and went to check in we were told that our suite wasn't available. They could offer us a strip view room in the Augustus tower for $375 on the first night $425 on the second night and a $75 daily resort credit. So the hotel screwed up and they could offer me a worse room for more money than I could have booked it for initially 4 months ago. Tremendously disgusting. After much back and forth they gave us a price for the room that was reasonable. However this basically ruined our first night. Furthermore the hotel says that it ""doesn't guarantee your type of room... they only guarantee you a room of some kind"". This type of behaviour means that you CANNOT TRUST THIS HOTEL. When a hotel cannot provide the booked room the classy thing to do is to move someone up a room class not down."
40,It was my second time around Vegas and I had a great stay at the Caesar Palace. Upon checking-in we were upgraded. The check-in was quick and the service was amazing.  We stayed in the Octavius tower.    Pro‚Äôs:  -Very clean & modern room  -Spacious room  -View on the bellagio fountains & strip (Paris Bellagio Planet Hollywood & MGM hotels)  - Quick access to rooms from restaurants casino and strip (other towers are further)  -Great lobby staff  - Good restaurants within the hotel.  -Beautiful d√©cor great shopping mall connected and nice pool area.    Con‚Äôs:  -We opted out of the room cleaning service but was told they would change our towels each day and it wasn‚Äôt the case. We had to call twice to get fresh towels.  -Wifi available only on two devices. Others in the room must pay a fee per day. It‚Äôs 2019....?!?    I would definitely go back to Caesars‚Äô Palace if returning to Vegas.    Enjoy:)
50,Chasers is a great hotel and casino first time staying at this hotel and had a great time. Employees where great and talkative when playing on tables. Restaurant food court and inside mall at same location
40,We wanted to acknowledge the extra effort customer service by Wilfred at the Diamond & Seven Stars check-in. Wilfred not only took great care of us during check-in but when we stopped back to verify a future reservation he made additional notes to our reservation about us celebrating a special birthday and was able to make a recommendation of the best tower to make our stay even more exceptional! With Wilfred's true desire to meet and exceed customer expectations he will soon be a candidate for even a bigger role in the Caesars customer area!
50,I have stayed in almost all of the hotels on the strip and Caesars Palace is one of my absolute favorites! Location is amazing the casino is super cool and the forum shops and places to eat and drink are awesome!
50,As always Caesars never disappoints. it is a great place to stay at. the place is immaculate the staff is friendly the ambiance is always entertaining there is always something going on where you can have fun. I really love this place and wouldn't stay anywhere else while in Vegas.
40,Staying at Caesar's Palace was a very nice experience. The Lady Gaga performance was the focus of the trip but unfortunately the show was cancelled due to illness. The room was well-kept and supplied. Caesar's was a great place to see shop and eat.
50,I love this location and all the great restaurants! I would stay here every time I visit Vegas love it!! Great shopping and employees are very kind and helpful. Pools are Beautiful I love the Carina shop I found sunglasses that are Amazing.
50,Great atmosphere employees where very helpful. person literary went it if his way to make sure I found my easy to room. Food was great. Had a great time. Hopefully going back for the new year's. Can't wait
50,Wonderful experience - great staff food and cleanliness of the property. would recommend a trip to Vegas and stay at Caesars. Homestead and Raos were exceptional dining experiences with excellent food and service.
50,I love Caesars Palace they always give me a beautiful room with a good strip view. The room is so nice and clean. Staff are all friendly and kind. Also all food in the buffet are excellent with different choices.
50,Great time fun excellent attention good food clean atmosphere good service big winnings interesting place good service beautiful place fun time big rewards big chances to win nice people safe place everything good
50,The rooms are very clean  the locations is accessible to other casinos China town and shopping malls. We did not have to go out because there are different kinds of food that they offered. The environment are very safe.
50,i stay in Link Hotel and we have a good service i never stay in Cesar Palace  i stay in other occasion in Paris  planet Hollywood and link hotel and always have a good time  the personnel in the hotels are very friendly
50,You have to see with your own eyes to believe you can't deny its beauty breathtaking exhilarating I will be most definitely revisiting Caesar as soon as possible with family and friends is the place to be
50,from rooms to restaurants customer service to gaming experiences Caesars Palace is the one spot to be in Vegas. i stayed almost at every hotel on strip and Caesar is the place i feel more comfortable and happy during my stay. great place great service
40,My wife and I love to take quick trips to Vegas to catch a show. This time we went to see Guns 'n Roses playing at the Coliseum. This was our first stay at Caesar's Palace and we booked a Premium room in the Palace Tower. All in all it was as expected... the room was nicely appointed with all of the expected amenities. We particularly enjoyed the in-room jacuzzi. We stayed 3 nights and the average cost was $250/night... Two of the nights were under $200 but the concert night was $395. [I understand supply and demand but the room is not worth $395/night].    One word of caution... there are no freebies so pay attention to grabbing anything from the fridge or even a coffee. You're better off going to the CVS across the street and buying snacks for a fraction of the price. And even then don't think you can use the fridge... there's a warning that you'll be charged $75 if you use it for your own items. That was enough for us to not even open the fridge.    We ate at Bacchanal Buffet for brunch and it was fantastic. Unless you pig out on the high value items (e.g. crab legs) the $65 price tag (per person) is a bit steep. We enjoyed it nonetheless.    If you like shopping then there is no shortage of places in Vegas. Having said that the Shops at the Forum are a hidden gem. We've walked the strip many times and this was the first time we noticed that large indoor mall.    And finally we used the self check-in and check-out and it was a seamless experience.
50,I'm a veteran and when i went to receive my players card.I was greeted with a warm smile and a sincere thank you for your service. Ivan explained how the veteran card worked and told me about all the perks...I thank him for his service. He's awesome
20,The most cluttered resort credit/free play/comp structure of any casino I have ever stayed at. This was my second trip these this year - and my god the staff was an absolute confusing nightmare to deal with.    Their Caesars Rewards hours are not 24/7 - have 2-3 staff members for so many guests at a time. I am a Platinum Member and did not feel like it when I left.    Will not being staying there ever again - shame.
30,The room was okay the lighting was a little dark and having no fridge for personal drinks is absurd. A stocked fridge by the casino and not offered a fridge for personal use is crazy for the prices of the room. I also was than charged for an item from the snack bar which I never took or used. Make sure you keep track of everything or they will try and charge you.
40,Stayed at the Palace Tower.  View of swimming pools no strip.  But refurbished and convenient location in the middle of the casino.  Caesars conveniently located in the middle of the strip.  Many restaurants at all hours for many pockets.  Caesars still a great Vegas destination.
50,Great place for the entire family.  Friendly staff and very clean. I would recommend this casino to anyone traveling alone or with family. It‚Äôs smack down in the the middle of everything you need in the strip
50,Our room was great. We could watch the fountains at Bellagio from our window. It was big. The room was often cleaned rather late but other than that they were kept up well. If you have a Diamond or 7Stars card there's a nice Lounge that serves food & drinks every evening. But you need to go early or it fills up. The shops are lovely but most are pricy. Only thing you should beware of is they close the pool in the winter. It was warm but you couldn't use the pools. The spa was very nice & a relaxing break.
50,The establishment was nice and clean. Every day we were cordially provided fresh linen and toiletries if needed. Excellent staff. We will definitely recommend a Caesars property to others so they can gain the experience we had. Just awesome!
50,Rooms were amazing. Loved the dining choices. Service was exceptional from check in to check out. Great night life. Over all experience was relaxing fun and exciting. Will definitely be back with friends and family.
50,Always first class treatment. The casino is outdated and needs refreshing. Several machines we inoperative for two straight days. Not enough blackjack tables open in the AM (6-9). 100 table is always empty will not lower denomination
50,We recently spent 4 nights at Caesars the room was amazing we were upgrading to a room that the bathroom was to die for! Employees and dealers were a joy to interact with! we will most definitely stay again.
50,Over the past 18 years I have been to Caesars over 20 times each time we stay in Vegas. We are always treated special our rooms are clean and the food is awesome! They have all the slot machines I love to play and the best shows in Vegas.
50,Other than a frustrating check in the trip was excellent. The bartenders are super fast with their tasty drinks. The cleaning service was awesome. The food was awesome at Mr. Chow's etc....The dealers where friendly and helpful to my newer gambling buddies. Cascata is awesome but we played 5 great courses.  Chrissy is a super star. The Rainman suite was excellent. Great trip.
40,Room was nice and staff was friendly. I would recommend!  There are many things to do in and around the facility. Shows and restaurants were fantastic.    Table game minimums are quite high. Close by to other casinos.
30,The room was very nice. We went for a package to see Joe Bonamassa in Oct. 2019.  I always prefer to stay at Casinos in Las Vegas that offer free parking and no resort fees but as this was for a special occassion we chose to stay at Caesers.  The property is VERY large and I would recommend to use their app for navigating-I didn't know about this and had a hard time figuring it out-I wish I would have been told about it at check in.
50,Went to see Jeff Dunham on a casino offer. Didn't make a dinner reservation and couldn't get a seat at the bar at the Old Homestead. But the Monte Crisco Bar serves the full Old Homestead menu. The bar tenders were extremely nice. The knew we were going to a show and made sure we got our food in a timely manner. Show was great. All and all a very nice evening out
50,The room was really nice and clean. The bed was comfy the curtains were not blackout so the sun did shine through.That is all I gave to say. Thank you very much. We enjoyed our time at this location and will visit again.
50,The staff at the Sportsbook and gaming tables were friendly and knowledgeable. The sportsbook staff was very generous with drink vouches upon making wagers. Overall a nice place to walk around and enjoy the scenery.
50,The good:  -Caesar‚Äôs wows you from the moment you pull up and walk in. Everything about it feels posh and luxurious.  -Big thumbs up to Anselmo at check in. He gave us a free upgrade to a beautiful room in the Palace Tower. Loved the spacious elegant room.  -Weather was cool for all but one day but the one day we stayed at the pool we were wowed by the opulence and amenities.  -Decent number of restaurants within short walking distance.  -Checkout was incredibly easy with online option.    Could be better:  -Part of it is a Vegas thing but uncharges for too many things. You‚Äôd think the $50 (USD) per day resort fee would give you some of these things but if you want coffee in your room it will cost you. The coffee kit provides Kcups at an exorbitant rate.  -The buffet is beautiful and has great food but it will cost you. You‚Äôll save money by walking across to Paris and enjoying their still-excellent buffet.
10,room adverage food below expectations and so so service are the start the finish is your bill for 20 dollar drinks and waaay over priced food and beverage. 20 buck coffee in the room . pass and stay somewhere else unless your king midas.
40,Great spacious rooms good food access to the forum shops great location. The service from our host was amazing! GNR With friends and bumped into Nicolas Cage Holly Madison and Dodgers Picchure (i forgot the name but my husband was excited).
50,Love the seats in the sports book best sports book around by far. Wish it was non smoking.... everything was clean people were very friendly  Nice that a large bar was near Sportsbook.. Bathroom were clean I enjoyed my visit
50,Beautiful view and wonderful service. I have never been disappointed here and will return often. I always enjoy the people and their friendliness. Thanks to Mehret for a fast check in! See you in May for the next conference.
40,"This was the only casino that my wife could get an angry orchard at while playing slots and we played ""a lot"" of slots this week. Other casinos only had the standard domestic beers. The casino wasn't overcrowded and had a good variety of slots. In addition we didn't leave smelling like smoke."
50,Great casino rooms were clean no people yelling down the halls easy in and out access internet works fine saw the the fight and went to some shows we will be going again in December and cease palace is one of the best hotels I've stayed in
50,Its better to check in at the counter so that the host will advice you better option than doing it at the Kiosk. I tried to check in at the kiosk and it did not work for me. Room at the palace tower is marvelous.
50,I loved the atmosphere of the casino. The energy and friendliness of the staff were amazing. The location to so many activities is also great - a short walk offers countless options shopping and eating.
40,The room was nice but not as nice as I'd hoped for. There were no prices listed for the mini bar items. No free coffee or water offered in the room. Very disappointing. The hallway to get to the palace towers smelled of throw up and it was like this the entire weekend.
50,I have stayed at many other Hotels on the strip but I always come back to Caesars and the Augusta Tower overlooking the Bellagio Fountains. The location on the strip is perfect for the type of events my family always enjoy.
50,The experience was great.I enjoyed the atmosphere.The restaurants were excellent.I enjoyed the wide selections of slot machines.The employees were friendly and courteous.I look forward to staying at Caesar‚Äôs very soon. The bars also had reasonably priced drinks.I look forward to staying at Caesar‚Äôs and using the excellent workout room.
40,Centrally located on Las Vegas strip nice hotel rooms lots of good restaurants inside and nearby. Food is pricey just like everything else in Las Vegas. Caesar's show are good especially the Celine Dion show but it's not available anymore. Mindfreak is another excellent show in Planet Hollywood.
50,Over all feel of the casino is that of a place of gaming. Historic property with great d√©cor. The Forum Shops are filled with great restaurants and the shopping keep the girls happy. They have though of everything virtually no reason to venture from the property!
50,We took a quick weekend trip to Las Vegas and fell in love with Caesar's Palace. The resort is beautiful and the staff we encountered were friendly at all levels of service. I stayed in the Forum tower and my traveling companions stayed in the Augustus tower. Even though the Forum tower is older and a little dated my room was spacious and comfortable. Plus if you're in Vegas you're not spending that much time in your room anyway. The Forum tower is also closest to the casino food court the Forum Shops Omnia and not to mention there's a bar right outside of the elevators. Even with all those things a mere steps away I had no noise complaints at all. I slept wonderfully. Its also really close to the monorail stop by access to the Flamingo. Will definitely be back!
40,I stayed at Caesars Palace for a week on business. The room was clean and quiet. Beds where comfy and the bathroom was clean. I would stay there again. Pools were closed at the time of our visit but you could go down and sun in the chairs.
10,Was extremely disappointed with our stay here. The room is nice lets start there but after paying over 200.00 for a room you are charged with an extra 18.00 a day for parking and 44.22 a day for a resort fee. So lets go over what the resort fee included two phones for WiFi 15 dollars fee after that. Pool (which was closed when we were there) gym (didn't even know they had one was never told and no signs) and if you think that includes coffee it doesn't you have to pay for coffee in your room. Was going to take a big group back next year but will never stay here again. If you want to stay on the strip book closer to downtown Circus Circus Stratosphere Treasure Island they don't charge a parking fee. Just FYI a lot of these resorts are now charging a parking fee so watch for that when you are room hunting. The resort fee is a new charge too I am aware of resort fees but not a day that is just ridiculous.
50,I love this hotel‚Äôs lobby.  It has a lot of shops in restaurants inside of it. They even have sports gambling which I love. They have a lot of casinos with a lot of fun games. They have concerts there. I actually saw Celine Dion sing there that was a beautiful concert.
50,We were in vegas for three days had a great time and made some money. Went to alot of the big casinos and also some of the smaller ones. Made a trip downtown for the first time in 20 years much improved since the last trip.
50,Beautiful Comfortable rooms~Excellent Rm Services~Maid Service especially!! They are so very Nice!!! Always request being close to the Elevator and They do Their best to accomadate us. And the View from the Augusta (We see the Fountains at Belargio's) or the Palace Wonderful Pool~And Caesar's being in the Center of the Strip is a Huge Plus!!! This past trip I stayed with Friends but I have been staying at CAESAR'S for MANY MANY years....And My Host Joanne Bacon is the BEST!!
10,This is absolutely the worst hotel I‚Äôve ever been in Las Vegas after I came to Las Vegas 3 times. I did not have a pleasant experience while many staff ignored me when I asked for help a couple of times or asked for any directions after I got lost several times. I even played in the casino for a couple of hours twice in 2 days a row BUT no one even bother coming to me and serve any drinks for me. I saw they kept coming to other guests and giving them all freakin drinks! I never felt so freaking invisible in this hotel before. I was not even aware that they would charge me for using wifi when I had to work remotely during my stay there! The heck why would this hotel keep overcharging the guests after they spent so much money for getting a room?? Plus they would charge you extra just using their TV without purchasing any special channels! I would strongly recommend Green Ranch Valley hotel or Bellagio hotel for your most amazing experience in Las Vegas. These two hotels offer free wifi AND airport shuttle for pickup/drop off for hotel guests. Bellagio even offer free passes to some of their nightclubs for hotel guests as well. Caesars palace definitely made me feel so miserable and made me felt so unhappy during my business trip in Las Vegas. Even I was screaming to go back to my home in Los Angeles and be at my own peace now.
50,We had a fantastic (and huge) room in the Augustus tower with views of the strip and the Bellagio fountains. However you can hear the fountains but it's not that bad. The casino is large so get ready for some walking. Nice that the Forum shops are close with lots of shopping and dining.
10,Staying here FOUR nights ‚Äî and no frickin pool! Nowhere did it say that they were closing their pools two weeks early. Nowhere.    Flew here 5 hours to swim in the pool and escape the cold 30 degree East coast weather for a long Veteran‚Äôs Day weekend.    The hotel just decided to close its pool early so there‚Äôs no pool whatsoever. $300 a night at this place and they can‚Äôt provide what any roadside motel can... a pool.    To add insult to injury they put us in a room that overlooks the pools we cannot use to taunt us. Their remedy for all this... they send you to use the Planet Hollywood pool (open to the public) or the pool at the Paris which is tiny. Oh and both require taking a cab.    Way to screw over a veteran on their veteran‚Äôs day vacation. Not even an upgrade. Manager came out with a straight face and said no. WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN.
50,Mehret at the front desk was so helpful efficient and friendly. She started our trip off just right! Thank you Mehret!    Our room is beautiful spacious clean and we have a view of the water fountain from Bellagio.
40,My husband and I were celebrating our birthdays and decided to see DIONNE WARWICK which was taking place at Cleopatra‚Äôs Barge in Caesar‚Äôs Palace. Had dinner prior to the show at RAO‚ÄôS Restaurant which my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed then proceeded on to see our show. DIONNE WARWICK played in a small venue which accommodated approx 165 people so there were no bad seats. Enjoyed her show and the whole evening. Plenty to see and do in Caesar‚Äôs.
50,I would highly recommend this casino it is very spacious and I noticed very cart friendly for those who have problems with mobility. The help is very friendly and there is enough help that you are not waiting for beverages.
50,I would just like to compliment you on your fitness facility. I travel quite often all over the country and am also a competitive bodybuilder so having a proper gym I can use on my travels is extremely important. This is easily one of the top 3 facilities I've had access to as far as functional equipment and machines. Everything's is very well kept and clean and your staff is great. The hours aren‚Äôt ideal as the club doesn‚Äôt open until 6am but otherwise very great experience. I treated myself to a spa package to unwind and it was very affordable given the nature of Vegas and again the staff was very pleasant and helpful.
50,Caesars exceeded expectations. Room was great (clean updated everything was immaculate) daily room service was as good as ot gets. Many food and restaurant options. All served good food and haff good service. Highly Recommend!
50,It was awesome ! The room is spacious . We had the best view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains! The bed was very comfortable. I really enjoyed the jetted tub and stand up shower. The staff very friendly. Some of the best restaurants are in the hotel. I will spread the word and recommend to others. My husband works for the airlines so we have many friends that travel to Vegas frequently. I will spread the word and send them your way. The forum shops offer a never ending shopping spree. We even got to meet Gordon Ramsey at Hell‚Äôs Kitchen.
40,Most of the employees try to make this a good experience unfortunately 1 person can ruin it but it‚Äôs still a great hotel. There are outstanding restaurants with many choices a great salon good casino and nice pool area
50,"You cannot go wrong with the restaurants from low end to high end. no bargains here but the quality and service are exceptional at Mr. Chow (check out the happy hour food specials at the bar) Hell's Kitchen Mesa Grill (this is the most creative cuisine at Caesars IMO and Bartender Donna is the best!) Ramsay's Pub buffet (go real hungry) Homestead Steakhouse Raos Nobu Beijing Noodle-I have dined at all of them multiple times for different meals. The Food court has good grab and go options-Pizza Halal guys Ramen Smashburger etc. and the Giada's Pronto has a lot of tasty options for a quick bite (their weekend only(?) brunch looks fantastic. I have never dined at Savoy but his Brioche stand in the casino offers buttery tasty brioche pastries.    Augustus tower strip view rooms are my favorite. Room numbers below XX70 are closer to the strip and have better views of the Bellagio fountains (if your room is on that side of the tower). This tower is closest to the seven stars valet lounge and VIP check in. The Octavius Tower is newer a smidge more technologically modern is FARTHEST from the casino and lobby but closest to the pool. All the Augustus and Octavius tower rooms are large with couches and a round table in an extra sitting area. The rooms in these towers are at least as large as Venetian/Palazzo and Wynn/Encore rooms. Nobu standard rooms are odd but nice. They are not square and have a lot of weird angles and not a lot of room to spread out. No view either but the hotel entrance is right in the middle of the casino for quick access.    Many of Caesars dealers are real old-timers and many speak English as a second language which can make communications challenging--this causes problems when money and betting are involved. otherwise they are generally competent sharp knowledgeable experienced and professional but many wear that ""I-hate-my-job"" face - and they are no fun to play with especially if you are losing money.    Notable exceptions--dealers to seek out include the following.    1. Benny (day shift carnival games) is employee no. 3 for Caesars and has been there 52 years. He is an awesome dealer and a very nice man with a lot of great stories if you chat him up.    2. Michelle (day shift roulette and BJ) is very friendly smart sharp professional helpful and always attracts a full table.    3. Krystal (graveyard BJ and Roulette) is also very friendly and runs an entertaining game. Sassy in a very fun and kind way but also is a very sharp dealer."
50,I was a little put off that you had to pay $14.00 for the coffee set up. I recall a time when the coffee was complimentary and still is in other resorts. However our room did not have the coffee set up just the Keurig cups. You still have to request decaf and most hotels do not carry decaf. It's the little things that make you feel welcomed after traveling so far. You have to pay a resort fee as soon as you arrive whether you use those services or not. So a free cup of coffee to relax after a long trip would feel nicer and more welcoming than the latter charge.
50,best time ever no problems with anything from flight to rooms all was excellent would definitely use the service again without hesitation my opinion ceasers is the best casino on the strip hands down my friend and his wife are going there next week because of my recommendation
50,The trip to Las Vegas was for 2yrs married and for Halloween + vacation to stay at Caesars was on our bucket list it was a great time we had fun it was like going back in time love the theme the orange of the place would go back
40,It would have been good to know about the resort fee before. As Govt Employee everything is preapproved so I have to eat those hidden fees! Apart from the hidden fees it was a great experience. Beautiful and Luxurious!
40,all were good. No real issues with room or the casino with exception of the cost to use the atm was outrageous. Room service was good and met a host who helped me. Spent quite awhile with the security department due to being robbed. That was not good.
40,The experience ruse good and the rooms or clean. My problem was that there were no suites available in every time I call well in advance there was never any suites available. The buffet food was marginal and the lines long and the meal at the homestead was not very good for the price. Overall Caesar's casino and hospitality/rooms were excellent
50,Actually when we arrived our room was not ready. The girl at the desk said there was a room ready but it was equipped handicap and she would waive all resort fees etc That worked for us appreciated what she did. Wish I could remember her name really a sweet and friendly employee
40,We booked Caesars for my husbands birthday. We largely choose this hotel as it had many amazing restaurants to choose from and has a great location on the strIp. We got a upgraded room with a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountain. The spa was very nice. We went to see Absinthe which was very entertaining. Overall it was a great experience.
50,Beautiful Hotel. Lots of shopping. Great food. Stellar Service. But bring lots of money as it is not cheap. Check in and check out very easy. Lots of slot machines. Huge Hotel with lots of amenities. Nice comfortable room.
40,"Even though we didn't win the employees and the place was very nice! It made the stay worth while.  We were treated like winners! So if any of yous are giving them bad reviews you must be giving it by loosing. Well I too lost a lot. But as long as they keep making us ""FEEL"" like winners then this is the place to always go in Las Vegas!! The buffet was absolutely awesome! I'm a buffet kind of person their choices in food was great! Every where we went the cleanness was also great!!  It is now mine and my husband one of the top five casino to enjoy with friends and especially with families!! I can't wait to come back! Thank you so much Caesar Palce!!"
50,The hotel and casino is the best on the strip for food fun and shiopping. Rooms are very nice. The Bacchanal Buffet is the best in the city way over the top food and service. The buffet can be crowded so i suggest going during the week and maybe not on the weekend.
50,Excellent location on the strip exceptional service. Rooms are among the best. Restaurants seem  limitless and the food is very good. There is a variety of entertainment and gaming. You can relax enjoy and have fun.
30,Ceasar‚Äôs is a classic! I stayed my 1st time in Vegas at age 21 and now 28 Yrs later I have returned. We booked the property online but then they couldn‚Äôt honor the bed configuration I had booked. I asked for an upgrade if possible to compensate and was told they didn‚Äôt have any available. I asked if we could get a voucher or something for parking. I wasn‚Äôt offered anything. The hotel and casino are still as magical as they once were with plenty of upgrades. However the sheets were so nubby/scratchy that we had to put a towel down under us and flip the duvet so the top was against our skin vs the underside. For $400/night x2 nights...I think they could have done better.
50,servicefoodroom sizegamblingsafetylocationshowsall outstanding and within the rich. easy to navigateoutstanding shopping in forum shop.air temperature comfortable.classy people.good drinks offered on the floor of the casino
50,We had a room overlooking part of the strip & with a view of the Bellagio fountains. Our room had a jacuzzi tub so that was really a place to relax. I did the spa one afternoon & it was really nice. The staff was helpful too. It would be a fun place to go with friends. The VIP lounge has a nice little buffet every night & it includes all of your drinks too. The staff in Caesars was very helpful.
50,The room uniquely theme fresh and clean very nice amenities it was at the Julius Tower it was great being on the 10th floor my wife really liked because it was very easy access to the room and the casino floor.
50,The best hotel casino on the strip by far.. food is excellent from Gordon Ramsay to ramen in the food court. Dealers are professional and very nice with a awesome personality. Overall it made me feel like home!!!
50,I have been to Las Vegas about 40 times and Cromwell is always my preferred stay. It is the best location easiest access to the strip (I love Cesaers but it does take awhile from your room to the strip) entertainment all hours of the night boutique style rooms over the top service and finally a great sportsbook. It is a little more expensive than other hotels around that area but definitely worth the money.
50,We travel to La s Vegas every year. There's never been a bad experience when we stay at the Caesar's properties. Whether it is the rooms the restaurants or the shows we always have the best time! After twenty-plus years of visits and lots of offers to stay at other resorts that are not Caesar's properties we always go back to Caesars
40,The people in the hotel were very nice. They do raise their prices during conferences so the best time to go is when there are no conferences in the hotel. The rooms are nice but there are no microwaves and you cannot put anything in the fridge it has a weight sensor if you put your own items in the fridge there is a $75 fine. There is still smoking allowed indoors in Las Vegas so if you are sensitive be sure to request a non-smoking room. The part that was very surprising to me was the distance from everything! It took me 30 minutes to walk from my room to the front desk and back. Bring shoes you can walk in. The food is expensive but there is a food court with normal-ish prices. I probably would go again for a conference unless it was mandatory. But if I was in good shape I would go to just walk around and see the sites on the strip. Be sure to check out Freemont street!
10,"Poor customer service overhcharged. Very frequent visitor of Vegas but wouldnt stay here again. We were quoted an upgrade charge and when we checked out it was more. We signed up for the rewards program and were given two free drink tickets. Went to the bar and ordered two standard small draft beers and owed money because it ""wasnt part of the drink choice."" Was asked when we checked in if we wanted a $10 food and beverage credit to avoid housekeeping the next day we declined. The next day we didnt get housekeeping and when I called at 430 that afternoon they told me it was because we were in our room which in fact we were out all day. Asked for the credit to the room and they said no. Very disappointing experience"
50,"My stay at Caesars Palace can be described with a few simple words the time of my life. Surrounded by the majestic decor and design that makes me feel free of any worries work stays back home In my mind when at Ceasars Palace "" I am here to have a wonderful time"" with AAA plus service drinks and my best friends the slot machines."
50,Excellent room great property plenty to do. Great restaurant choices and lounges to hangout. Best steakhouse The Old Homestead and cigar bar Monticristos night clubs for all ages and sports book is very comfortable.
50,Great place clean nice staff and plenty of gambling options.    Good spots book area.    Great expierence when communicating with thier staff.    I would reccomend Caesars Palace to any of my friends and family.
40,The experience you'll receive at Caesars is great however be prepared for the bill at the end. I was saddled with resort fees of 40/day which was an unpleasant surprise. If that is no big deal then you'll have a great time.
50,We had an absolute great time celebrating my daughter's 21st birthday. We visited many casinos but loved this one the most the atmosphere was perfect for what you should expect in Vegas. Plenty of choices for food that stay open late plenty of nightclubs and bars to visit. We will be back.
50,We had a great experience. The rooms were comfortable and clean. Staff was very nice and helpful. The location was centrally located to all attractions on the strip. The food was very good but a bit pricey. Overall we had a great time.
50,Rooms are nice convenient to everything although be ready to walk. Food is awesome especially Gordon Ramsey's Pub. We cannot stay away from the Pub for food. Everything is especially good.  Would like to try the pool but never have a chance.
30,it was ok but I lost my key took them forever to open my door that was the only thing everything else was ok. if you go there ask them what is the back up plan for when you lose ur key cause I damn near waited half an hour to open my room you almost caught me sleeping in the hall way and as a matter of fact I think I called twice to front desk to see what was the hold until finally some lady opened my door and I can enjoy my night.
40,The rooms are very good and clean may be a little faraway from the Casino.  I had some problem with one of the Diamond Room person's that spoiled a little my stay at the hotel but I hop to never see her again at Caesar's.
10,Checked in about 20 minutes before official check in time at one of the kiosk machines. We received a notice that our room was not ready yet and that we would be alerted when ready. So we waited in the lobby which has no seating. 30 minutes go by and I decide to ask the woman near the kiosks and she checks she acts surprised and says well your room is ready. We go to our room in the Forum tower which is very old. In the elevator one of the mirrors was cracked in another part of the ceiling tile was broken. Everything is dated. The room was good sized but the furniture was so beat up the bathroom floor was filthy. The TV and makeup light in the bathroom were broken. We called the desk and they told us to let them know when we would be out and they could possibly send someone to fix it. But they cleaned the room they should check for broken items BEFORE paying customers arrive. We were never offered any credit or different room. The shower door needed oiling as it make a loud squeaking sound when you opened or closed it. We booked directly with Caesars online so I was not expecting a disgracefully cheap room. We had other family staying in the hotel and one couple had similar issues with their room. Another couple that are Caesar elite members were put in the Augustus tower and that was much much nicer. We were also disappointed that Caesars up-charged for EVERYTHING. Resort fee is $39 and that includes wifi but only two devices more will cost you more. Valet parking is more. Pool is free but using the lounges near the pool cost more. The Starbucks charges at least $1 more per item. We were not impressed at all. We will never stay here again.
50,Centrally located on the strip with all the action within walking distance. Great dining shopping & night life all in one location. Highly recommend for ladies wanting to have fun while feeling safe.
50,The staff at Ceasar‚Äôs Montecristo Cigar Bar are extremely helpful and friendly. We had a very good experience and will definitely return again. The bartender was very knowledgeable regarding the bourbon menu and shared information on drinks we hadn‚Äôt tried before.
50,The room was great had the strip view and the spa was great. The hotel food was amazing and it is really clean and tidy I would recommend this resort to everyone it is right in the middle of all the action Vegas has to offer
20,Caesars is slipping. Furniture in rooms is banged up carpet worn wallpaper outdated. Pillow case was stained and mold in the grout in shower. Need to step it up in property management.oom In room dining menu omitted prices and ultimately were too high. Breakfast for $50 plus per person is not warranted by quality of food.
20,Front desk check- in took way too long (45 minutes with no wait line) front desk clerk very unfriendly. Room was dirty and furniture looked as though it came from a second hand store very scuffed up. Lack of attention to detail for the prices charged.
50,The spa at Caesar‚Äôs is fantastic. If you ever get a chance to visit them for a spa treatment and some time in their pools you should definitely spend the time. So relaxing. The service is fantastic. I will definitely revisit. Amazing!!
30,When we booked we were forced to do two different reservations. One under the conference room rate and one for the extra night we were spending when we arrived the night before the conference started. We tried to link both reservations by phone prior to arriving and asked to stay in the same room the whole time. When we arrived we were told it would be an extra $50 to upgrade to have the same room the whole time. We agreed. Get to the room to find it‚Äôs a room with two double beds not a king sized bed we booked. After phone calls and visiting the front desk we were told the best they could do is move us the next night to the room we actually reserved. We still had to pay the $50 room upgrade fee though for the first night and wasted countless amounts of time calling the front desk or standing in line to get the room issue fixed.  The morning of our first day housekeeping came by at 9:30am knocked on our door quickly once and before I could even stand up she was walking into our room asking us when we were going to check out. Unacceptable.  There is no coffee or tea in the room like pretty much every other room I have ever stayed in. If you want coffee you need to purchase a $14 K Cup pack from the mini bar.  Last the elevators and hallways perpetually smelled like vomit. We noticed this day after day.  We tried to be patient since it‚Äôs a busy week in Vegas with various conferences but we spent $600 a night for the first night‚Äôs stay and this kind of experience is unacceptable. The only redeeming quality is the rooms were nice spacious and comfortable. We were excited to stay at Caesar‚Äôs and we were quite disappointed overall and won‚Äôt be back.
50,If you want to feel like a king or queen go to Caesars palace! The best hotel in the world. Amazing service wonderful room clean and everything is in the hotel. We had the room with fountain view and it was breathtaking! Very big room with an amazing bed and bathroom! I come back
40,We usually stay at the Paris or Rio because we like their machines better. Tried the Palace this time since it was the location of the Great Gift Wrap Up. The room was much nicer than the other two and the staff was simply outstanding. We were surprised by the friendliness of the the staff from the valet to the VIP center to the maid...they were all great. Since we had plenty of meal comps at other properties we did not eat there but did note the long lines at all the restaurants. Unimpressive gambling with poor video poker schedules (as expected on the strip).  Debating on returning there in January because the room was so nice.
40,Great place for fun and excitement but expensive in some area the pool is a great place to spend the day Omnia is busy and must wait a long time to get in rooms are clean and casino floor provide lots of fun
50,Went here for my annual birthday trip and it was great. It was my dads first time to visit Las Vegas and he loved the hotel. The staff were very accommodating and friendly. The rooms were nice and clean.
20,We were greeted with the impersonal cheek-in kiosks and things didn‚Äôt get much better from there. Our room in the Julius Tower was average at best. The ‚Äúhot‚Äù water was warm to freezing cold. Also there was a strong sulphuric smell emanating from the shower drain that got worse after using the shower. We called maintenance on both issues. Nothing was done and nothing offered for the inconvenience. Other than the maids the front desk hotel staff and on site restaurant staff are not friendly. I would put them at rude to indifferent. Paying a daily resort fee when the pool was closed was the final slap in the face. We have stayed at Caesar‚Äôs Palace on numerous occasions. This was our worst experience and probably our last stay for the foreseeable future.
50,I think this is One of the best hotels on the strip. There is Lots to see and do in this hotel. It Even has its own Theatre with lots of famous people performing there. Even the statues come to life to tell a story
50,It was my boyfriend's first time visiting Vegas so I wanted to give him a great experience. We got a free upgrade due to a slight malfunction with our key card and could not be more impressed by their customer service. I definitely plan on staying there again.
50,"Where did the time go?! Fifty-two years ago we were welcomed to the newly-opened  spectacular Caesars Palace for our dream honeymoon. Splendor service excitement  entertainment!! Caesars had provided memories to last a lifetime.  Fast-forwarding many happy years later we returned to Las Vegas to attend our 11 year-old grandson's Go-Cart Race. To say that we were overwhelmed by all the magnificent additions to the hotel would be an understatement. Caesars appeared to have grown from a palace into a city--The Towers! The Fountains! The Forum Shops!  Imagine our dismay upon checking in when we learned that our phone reservationist  had mistakenly placed us in an older Tower known to have no view rooms!--And the  entire hotel was fully booked! Enter Kristin our Reception Desk Attendant: When I explained how excited we were to return to Caesars after 52 years (I even showed her  the Caesars postcard and Brochure I had saved all these years!) Kristin shared them with her colleagues and ""sprang into action."" Within minutes we were handed the keys  to a spectacular view room on the 21st floor in the Palace Tower. Thank you Kristin!  The ""Magic"" of Caesars Palace lives on."
50,We stayed in the Julius Tower. There was not much of the view but the room was excellent! The bumped us up to a suite!    The staff was so friendly and so accommodating! I personally felt the the hotel lived up to it's name!
50,We always plan to get to Caesars at least a couple of times a year from our home in the  Baltimore area. The hotel and casino are great. Plenty of good places to eat; the hotel and casino are clean and very nice; the staff are always pleasant and helpful. You can't go wrong with Caesar's!
30,This place is basically a dozen hotels all linked together by a series of hallways restaurants casino floors etc. The hallway leading to the Palace Tower smelled of vomit and industrial-strength cleaner for my whole (five-day) trip. The food court was unreasonably expensive ($26 for two pieces of pizza). The two Starbucks always had lines (20 minutes one morning!). But my room was AMAZING. TWO bathrooms! And one had a bidet! Amazing view GREAT staff and easy checkin and checkout. I guess if I had to go back to Vegas again I would consider staying here again.
50,Always beautiful accommodations with energy entertainment great food and shopping  Pools are very nice. The Spa and COLORS Salon was this trips highlight. The artisans stylists and color PRO‚Äôs made this trip great. Thank you to the salons newest addition Oscar. Feeling gorgeous
50,Staff was awesome the bed was amazing it was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in...like being on a cloud. The linens and pillows were amazing as well. Love that we could get away from the hustle and bustle and go to our own little quirt hotel within Caesars Palace. Loved it all.
40,Great hotel and casino but very large. Easy to get turned around and lost on casino floor. Great variety of restaurants and shops for all budgets. Great location on the Strip. Main showroom always has top performers.
50,Cesar's Hotel and Casino is center Strip Las Vegas. Fantastic entertainment. Parking garage is pay to park. Live entertainment superstars from Madonna to Brooks and Dunn and Seinfeld. Sports Book is great. Too bad they permit smoking.
10,The toilets dirty no heat on room hair in sink. Then they move us and the key card doesn‚Äôt work nor the remote. They give us a gift card for our troubles and when the restaurant calls they deny even knowing anything about it. We spend 3 hours in our room dealing with their maintenance issues. Over used rooms and aweful stay.
50,The hotel is amazing because of Tom. His attention to detail is second to none. Excellent service and quick and efficient with his replies. There was nothing he could not do for us. Very welcoming to everyone. I would stay again because of Tom.
50,room was really clean and in order including sheets. check in and check out was really very easy and quick including valet service. The driver who brought our car car was very nice  respectful and appear happy and willing to do us a service.
10,Had a CONFIRMED room reservation in the Augustus tower upon check-in we where downgrated to the Palace tower. Someone should have contacted us so we could have changed hotels. Thru a damper on my 80th birthday celebration. NEVER AGAIN !
40,My wife and I came our for our second wedding anniversary. I sent her to the spa for the day and she thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience. We had our usual stop by Searsucker highly recommend the duck fat fries and one of the best wings you will ever have. The sportsbook was amazing as usual an the mobile app really makes for a more efficient weekend. Only issue is their computers went down the last night and I could not get a marker or close out my sportsbook account. It would have been nice if they did something to comp this out especially since I earned diamond status on the trip. We had a good time but with more casinos opening in the south Vegas needs to find a reason for us to come back more often. Not really worth the bang for the buck especially since I am a gambler.
30,The room was clean no issues overall. However for the prices you pay for food drinks and per night the service should be a lot better. Nothing really great about my stay I would say it didn‚Äôt stand out one way or another.
40,The back casino was crazy loud with party people that didn't play the slots. It wasn't pleasant because no drinks were offered to us while we were throwing money into the machines. No conversation was possible either because of the noise level.
50,This was a guy trip three of us in a suite in the Julius Tower.. We ate at several restaurants and enjoyed them all. The video poker machines were plentiful although not generous this trip. The cocktail staff were attentive and accurate. The atmosphere was inviting for drinks and play.
20,The casino grounds and over prices restaurants were nice. The hotel room was over priced and not of good quality. No fridge no microwave IN A SUITE!! Room was dirty. You can stay at nicer for less $$$
50,Took my wife to Vegas for a quick birthday trip - Caesar's upgraded us to a bigger room in the Octavius Tower! Great friendly staff and really made the trip (first Vegas trip for my wife) her favorite - can't wait to go back and stay at Caesar's! Tyler at the front desk was spectacular.
50,I stayed at Caesars Palace for 4 nights and I had a wonderful experience. I was pleasantly greeted at the front desk by Macy and she was able upgrade me to a suite. The Augustus Premium Suite was amazing and the view was to die for. I highly recommend staying at this hotel as I will be staying there again in February.
50,We had an amazing room overlooking the fountains of Bellagio. The room had a hot tub bath and a huge bathroom and the most comfortable bed! It was awesome! We requested an upgrade from our original reservation and Emma at the desk totally hooked us up!
50,Great trip didn‚Äôt win any money üòî but still had a great visit! My host got us tickets to Santana and then to the Canelo fight!!!! The suite is always great and clean! Always enjoy staying at Caesars!! See you again soon!!
50,Amassing view neat room great service wonderful show great time at the casino floor! But the most important was every restaurant that I visited I was treated like at home delicious food and great service!
50,We definitely love staying there. I enjoy the Buffalo machines! The shops are great. We had a great view of the pool and had a great time at the pop-up of the Diamond lounge. Your staff was great. Looking forward to our next trip next month!
50,Very good. We are overlooking the swimming pools. The room has two bathrooms. My sister who was with us was placed that she can have her own. Not a lot of noise like other hotel we stayed. You can hear next door.
50,My daughter took me to LV for my birthday So glad we stayed at the Palace! Our room was immaculate. They gave us a discount for not having housekeeping. The smoke free lobby was fun and also very clean. Pool area as well. Just a beautiful place!
40,Loved many of the food court options Vanderpump rules and location made it easy to access other Las Vegas attractions easy to access Uber rides. Rooms were clean and spacious. Went to a concert at The Colosseum and it was nice to stay there and not have to drive or take transportation to the event.
50,What can be said about one of the most iconic and luxurious hotels and casinos in Las Vegas? Opulence spectacular rooms and amenities service. An extensive amount of dining selections and a large floor of gaming choices and courteous staff.
50,Fantastic views from our room easy check in very helpful loved the room very busy hotel but didn't feel crowded room was very clean shower leak a bit and was fixed straight away so close to all the fantastic shops especially the ones located at this hotel
50,everything was perfect thanks to my host and all the people at the caesars. if i had questians they where always answered in a professionel and friendly way. i never had a room in which i was not happy. restaurant food and even snacks where satisfying and tasty. my massages where calming and pools invigorating
40,nice rooms good variety of restaraunts and food conference food was good food servers were polit  Vegas have become and expensive town  Like the upgrades that have been made to the hotel. Employees seem very friendly
50,If you want the true Vegas experience with all the trimmings Caesar's Palace is the place to go. I have stayed at many of the hotels on the strip over the years and Caesar's is the place I always think of first when I think of a trip to LV. The ambience the luxury the rooms the employees the food the shopping and of course the gaming options are phenomenal. Although the slots are my game. I am a great-grandmother and have seen a lot of changes. Caesars has been a constant classy and special place.
20,It is definitely the emblematic hotel of Las Vegas. Lovely hotel comfortable with good entertainment. Clean room comfortable bed and a dream bath. A Buffet of the best in america.    All the good experience you can enjoy is lost with poor attention and excessive charges on your credit card which in my case doubled the total cost of the stay.    I approached the Front Desk and they treated me like stupid that I was wrong and that if I didn't like it this was Caesars Palace. That no employee could give me an answer because no one spoke Spanish.    Without a doubt there is a differentiated treatment towards the Spanish-speaking tourist I felt absolutely discriminated against and unheard of. Experience management for Front Desk employees is lacking.    I returned to Chile and still kept a charge on my credit card that was regularized once emailed to Mr. Adam Muller. But I have not had a satisfactory response to this incident which spoils all the good experience you can have and results in tourist abuse.    I would certainly not return because there is no second chance for a first impression.
50,At Caesars I was provided the highest quality treatment (albeit I have Diamond status) but they did ensure I had a great experience overall. Staff was very attentive and helpful. They were proactive in extending their warm welcomes to us before we could say hello. I did pay attention how they treated non-status guests and I was glad to see that their exceptional customer service was extended to other guests.
10,no one never ever complies friendly and especially the ones at the front desks and security people act as if like they are from street with no professionalism need to be trained more fir the pay checks they take to serve people
50,I sincerely enjoyed my experience at Caesars. From my room to the restaurants to the shops to the casino I experienced no problems and had a wonderful time. It is convenient to all the great places in Vegas. But Caesars has such a great ambience
30,Short girls trip for Halloween get away. Room was nice but next time balcony needed. Short staffed at check in which lent to rush check in and wrong room assignment. Too some time to sort out. Friends got gift on bed same extant reservation with us and we did not. Think it‚Äôs nice but could be consistent.
40,Employees that cannot answer simple questions (where is the bathroom?) Layout is difficult to work with problems at machines took a long time to address but service for drinks was excellent and very quick (hence the need for the restrooms)
50,Our stay at the hotel was excellent and the staff were helpful. The room was clean and the location being right on the strip was really convenient. It was a short walk from Caesar's Palace. I would recommend trying Gordan Ramsay's Pub or Hell's Kitchen those two restaurants were great.
50,Room was clean and nicely decorated. The casino is up to date. The housekeeping staff did an excellent job. The food court offered many choices and they were all very good. I don't have anything else to say.
50,Room was beautiful but they didn‚Äôt offer coffee/tea in room free. I understand that alcoholic beverages are to be paid for but coffee! Most hotels offer this convenience.  On the one day that they missed cleaning our room we called and they came up promptly.
50,Caesar's Palace is a world unto itself there in the heart of everything on the Strip. It is kept immaculate by the staff which is a feat considering its enormous scale. There are plenty of food options available almost too many rooms to count excellent gaming and all the other amenities you could imagine. You really don't need to leave the property for a total Vegas experience.
50,The check in was easy. Room service great. Casino and room was nice and clean. Dealers were friendly. Plenty dining areas and shopping near by. We stay at this hotel every year when visiting in las Vegas
50,Rooms were very nice clean and housekeeping was superb. The facilities were nice and clean. Employees were prompt and courteous. The restaurants were excellent on time with reservations and the food was great.
40,Friendly and professional versus their competitors ! I spent significant amounts of money and time at the Cosmopolitan and wish I had done it all at Ceasars. Dealers and pit bosses went out of their way to help me !
50,Beautiful room restaurant selections. The Buffet was an awesome experience. No matter where you find yourself the total staff is awesome and makes one feel very special & appreciated.It is definetly our destination property for Family & Friends.
50,I always stay at Caesar's because the rooms are so nice and the staff is very helpful. Cleanliness is very important to me and they always do a great job.  There are several very nice restaurants. We loved Mesa Grill and Rao and Caesar's buffet is the best in Vegas.
50,I enjoyed my spacious room in my favorite Augustus Tower facing the Bellagio fountains. I needed a small fridge for my meds and was accommodated within 10 minutes after I entered my room.  That first day started and ended well with a nice jackpot while playing the Roman Rewards machines.
50,Or stay at Paris casino and hotel in Las Vegas was phenomenal We stayed at the Paris casino and hotel in Las Vegas and as always were treated as royalty. All the way from the VIP front desk help to the cocktail waitresses on the floor and the cleaning staff for the rooms everything was excellent. We enjoy the games of Paris the restaurants there are great and we always look forward to coming back again. The swimming pool is very clean and maintained. The beds Are very comfortable and the rooms always look brand new. Paris really knows how to take care of their guest and if you need a Casino Host contact Cindy Hinkley Paris in the Casino Host department she will take very good care of you as a guest.
50,Well worth every penny. Must stay there for the overall experience. Food options ranged from an inexpensive piece of pizza to a 5 star restaurant. Everything so well kept and clean. Would go back in a heartbeat.
50,the experience was wonderful so much to see a must vacation easy access to other sites in the area most anything you want to eat very relaxing always felt safe keep up the good work to all the employees
40,Had difficultly in checking in the early morning 2AM with the lobby registration. It took a long time - seems the person is new. Then asked for a late check out ( 7Stars perks) and was denied waited a long time for a manager and had the same Answer.  Left very disappointed.  Then when asking for extra towels housekeeping in the floor said no showing we opted for no housekeeping But we didn‚Äôt!!! Had to call to have it straightened out.    Checked with the VIP registration ( what a difference in welcoming) later in the pm and perks was honored with a smile. Thank you Lei!!    As always everything else is great!
50,Our room was fantastic...Augustus Tower overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Casino play was fun..even if we didn't win..exciting as always! The dining experience is always 5 star..this is my 6th stay at Caesar's and I will be returning again very soon!!
50,We stayed in a suite in the Augustus Tower facing the strip. It is a great suite if you want a view of the strip. Can't get enough of that view. The only downfall is that you can hear the noise from the traffic and noise from the pool party at the Cromwell until 3 or 4 AM. Bring your earplugs and you will love this suite.
50,There are no words to describe Caesars Palace.... Lets start from our room at the highest floor at Augustus‚Äô tower overlooking the strip and the fountains of Bellagio.... It was huge and absolutely luxurious.... the view was fantastic!! So many lovely restaurants ... We enjoyed the Bacchanal buffet and shopping at the Forum shops tremendously... We loved the architecture of this hotel the statues and the pools were so amazing!! So lucky to have been able to attend a Dionne Warwick gig at Cleopatra‚Äôs Barge as well!! Can‚Äôt wait to visit again!!!
40,Went in for a visit to eat and play it was fun did ok as far as playing. Drink service was surprisingly good except for one waitress and the rest were good. The rest temperatures in the casino were cold but I think it was because we sat by the doors
50,This was arguably the best suite experience I‚Äôve had in Vegas with regards to size location and amenities. It‚Äôs the perfect suite for bachelor parties as the accompanying two rooms are great for the entire group. The maid staff was especially awesome and deserves special recognition for dealing with us.
50,You can always count on a consistently good experience from the cleanliness quality and quantity of gambling food and entertainment options. Additionally you can see small upgrades to the property. Whole I stayed at Paris this time - the rooms especially in the newer towers are top notch for the strip.
40,waitresses on the casino floor very attentive nice fresh areas did not seem over crowded we liked larger spaces for playing . Machines were updated  could vary your amont being played more than we haved noticed in vegas.
50,It was my 1st trip to Vegas and I had the time of my life. I can't wait until the next trip now I want to go every year. Ceaars Palace was like something out of the movies. it was a great experience alll the people were very nice.
50,Great place to stay and affordable. Central to everything you need. Rooms are spacious Bathrooms are Luxurious and staff are second to none. I would highly recommend for family getaways friends gatherings or mistress meet ups.  Thanks for reading. Hope you have a blast on your next trip.    V
40,Caesars palace Las Vegas is great place to visit the rooms and location were really good.  I would recommend to my relatives family members and friends to visit the property.  Most of the employees were friendly and the property were kept very clean all the times.
50,was staying at Caesar Palace. I waseing offered concierge service and an upgrade to a small suite for a very minimal cost. I called for toothbrush extra towels even a comb and they delivered. Love the pool!!
50,Loved Caesars Palace. Will hopefully get to stay there next time we go to Las Vegas. Everything you could need is right there on property. Restaurants shopping lots of different slot machines... and it‚Äôs so light and airy.
30,We have stayed almost exclusively at Caesars many times over the last 20 years and in the last 2-3 years it has become extremely expensive to stay eat and drink there. To become diamond status requires a significant amount of play time but the benefits are not representative of the assumed status.
50,Beautiful room with great view and amenities. The hotel has beautiful surroundings including many Roman statues. The numerous restaurants have excellent food and beautiful surroundings. The employees are very helpful and personable.
50,Hotel and Cassino are both great. Clean stunning big great service. Had a wonderful week stay. It¬¥s located at the very center of the strip so you can walk to almost everywhere in vegas from there.
50,Accommodating staff and beautiful property. Delano met us at the front desk and was extremely kind and helpful with our travel situation. He was very accommodating and Caesars should be proud to have him as a front man representing their company. We were very impressed.
50,Caesars Palace is a fun property to stay at. Caesars offers fun gaming great restaurant selections entertainment and fine shopping all in one location. It is also surrounded by other properties for you to explore.
30,Beautiful Room at good value off peak. Pool area view was fantastic. Booking via telephone reservations and was a hassle as I am a rewards member and booked 2 nights and my friend booked the 1st night as I could not book the 1st night and add him as a guest because he was not a rewards member. Real hassle as he arrived day 1 and I arrive for day 2 and 3. My understanding is that the rewards issue has not been resolved with their booking system. With all the technology available I would expect Caesars should be more helpful with the reservation. I'll try another hotel on my next visit to Las Vegas as this reservation was very inconvenient.
30,Caesars Palace is a MASSIVE area that takes up about two blocks of the Las Vegas strip. This review is for the hotel. We stayed in the Palace Tower in a junior suite. Which was quite expensive and overlooked the pool (which was not open in October) the top of the Nobu (and all its rooftop equipment) and faces two other CP towers. Maybe other towers are different? The mini-bar takes up part of the space on top of the dresser and if you vibrate he sensors they can charge you for the item they think you touched. NO free in-room coffee!!! There IS a Keurig but 4 coffee pods will cost you $14 courtesy of the mini-bar!!!!! If you want to purchase your own beverages good luck keeping then cool as the in-room fridge is fully stocked to the gills with mini-bar beverages for purchase (again ridiculous pricing). If you desire to have an additional non-stocked fridge for leftovers/personal beverages that‚Äôs a $25/day charge to rent one. The iconic robes are no longer available for use in the room; however they will happily sell you one in the gift shop. The furniture and fixtures show signs of wear & tear. Just not what it used to be. (That‚Äôs why the rating is low). Service is still friendly and otherwise the hotel is acceptable. Be prepared to smoke a pack or second-hand smoke while walking to your hotel room from the lobby. (Not all casinos are this smoky)
50,Best customer service & amenities.  VIP treatments & stress free environment. Staff always available to help even before asking. Busy & clean. Has a lot of variety of slots & table games to do your Charity works. One stop for all your fun activities.
50,Excellent stay. Stayed in the Julius tower it was in a great location in the hotel. Great food choices. Mesa Grill is my favorite restaurant. It's nice to have the mall attached to the Hotel. Pool area is so nice and relaxing.
20,The 2 stars are for the convenient location and new renovation. We upgraded our room to the newly renovated palace tower which is newer bigger. But still no cattle. And even coffee pods or tea are not free. I didn‚Äôt expect free slippers but we also had to ask for shower gel from room service. Otherwise only soap bar is provided. So I can‚Äôt experience the 4.5 star service or hardware here. I‚Äôve stayed in other hotels on the strip before. At least all the basic necessities were provided. on top of that the rear uber pick up is so far it‚Äôs completely the opposite side of the bell office. So literally we had to roll the luggages through the entire resort to get picked up.
50,Friendly and helpful staff awesome suite with fanastic view of the strip great dining options in the resort good atmosphere in the casino everything was clean good location on the strip I certainly will stay here again
50,Great room comfortable beds and atmosphere was great. The room was also big and very comfortable. The casino is very nice and fancy and everything as far as food goes is in walking distance. We'll definitely be back again. üòÅ
40,Thanks to Anthony on check in for upgrading us and Giving us water after a long journey. Great customer service and he is an asset to Caesars resorts. Thank you Anthony we loved our room with the amazing jacuzzi bath.  Great hotel with excellent facilities massive casino and large shopping mall with Roman theme.  Vanderpump cocktail lounge and Trevi restaurant were excellent for service and food and drink. Highly recommended.  The pool area was large too with lots of loungers.  Only downside was the hotel was so massive and it‚Äôs like a maze and some staff couldn‚Äôt really direct us to our tower or room.  Would recommend Caesars palace and I would stay here again.
50,Rae helped us with checking in. She is wonderful and very accommodating. She gave us a room with really nice view. She deserves a five star award! We loved staying at this hotel. I wish you can provide the essentials (shampoo bath jel shower cap.. ) to your customer consistently.
50,The only reason I am troubling myself to leave a review is because of how amazing the concierge was. Tyler!! You‚Äôre the bomb! I forgot your last name! Night shift front desk worker made our stay so much easier. He put in a lot of extra work just to help us out. We appreciate you bro and hope you get the recognition you deserve!!
50,My friend was a seven star member so we got a free suite and I‚Äôll kinds of free food with carbs. Almost the whole trip is free. It was an incredible experience. There are many restaurants from all of the famous chefs around the world. Gordon Ramsay Bobby flay Giada I‚Äôll have restaurants within walking distance of the propertyOctober 2019 vacation. We went and saw the show Absinthe and it was incredible
50,My wife and I travel with our son and daughter-in-law to Caesars once or twice a year. Caesars never fails to deliver on a great time. We always enjoy cocktails and fine dining. Nobu's is a must on every trip. Looking forward to our next trip for March Madness.
50,It was my first time visiting Las Vegas and we were celebrating my girlfriend‚Äôs birthday. We were very excited to stay at Caesars palace. Special thanks to Tangela who made our stay extra special. She was so polite and professional when helping us check in. Overall a great experience we hope to be back soon.
50,From check in to my room everything was top notch and it continued throughout my stay. Every employee I encountered was helpful curtious and made my stay a great time. Gaming was easily accessible and fun dealers always helpful.
50,The bed was one of the most comfortable of all time for the first time I realized how important it is to have real good beds. When you fall a sleep then wakes up in the morning with a such refreshing that both me and my wife agreed. We loved it.
50,I received a text about an hour or two after checking in saying if we needed anything to let them know by texting them. I asked for more towels and they were in our room when we return. The front desk adjusted our room to a personal preference after hearing my wife and I discuss a room we stayed in previously be were unable to book. He did this without saying anything. It was a nice surprise.
50,Very helpful with check in and room was excellent. My wife always wants to go back to Caesars Palace as she likes to gamble there! We will be coming back again in December for our annual winter vacation!
50,Your business is only as good as your staff and your staff was excellent!! The rooms were clean and the bathrooms were spotless!! My trip to Vegas was made special by your great service. Only suggestion would be to have slots at the bar machines. None of the Casinos had that feature.
20,"Want to be nickel and dimed? Want your stay to be a hassle? Caeser's is the new Frontier Airlines. As a couple you cannot use one rewards points account. You can't even book a hotel in your spouse's name. Guests must be registered when you book your room- I had to argue to add a friend flying in late so she could get a key. The bellhop won't take perishables or glass. (I had to argue that my Atkins shakes were not perishable. And for shame I also brought a Perrier bottle) Now I understand as it took over TWO hours to locate my luggage. I had to get it myself from the bellhop because once they'd determined my ticket hadn't been processed correctly...it was still going to be at least another 1/2 hour. Can't find that wine corkscrew because it's not where it should be? And accidentally move a bottle in the fridge? That'll be a $75 fee for storing personal items. Housekeeping didn't bother to do anything but make the bed and add new towels the first day. (They left dirty towels on the bed and all the dirty glasses and trash.) They also didn't bother to check the snack bar as I was charged for 3 items I did not consume. Food trays were left in the hallways for two days. The final bill was a mess of credits re-adds & odd charges. Ie: if your room rate is $269 a night for 5 nights they take your deposit into account divide it per night and list your room rate at $152.50 per night. (Not the exact math but you get the idea.) Instead of every other hotel bill that lists your total occupancy rate and takes the deposit off the total at the bottom of the bill. Taxes are added to each item instead of giving the list price of the item. After spending 15 minutes staring at a gazzillion numbers trying to figure out why the bill was over $100 more than it should have been- I trudged down to the lobby to get a NORMAL hotel bill and have the charges corrected. I will say I didn't have to argue much and that the valet charge was removed for one day for the luggage hassle when I asked for it. Ivy the ""text concierge"" service was convenient as was the Express check-in. The room was actually nice comfortable and clean overall. But the hassle was not worth it and I won't risk it in the future. If the next industry conference is hosted there I will stay at another property."
40,I stayed at CP twice in the past three months. The first was an overnight stay with my wife and two teenage daughters and the second was for three nights with guy friends. I received Diamond status through a status match which I recommend others investigate.    The tower you are assigned to matters quite a bit in terms of walking. I stayed in an Augustus Tower room with a view of the Bellagio Fountain the first time and the second I stayed in a Palace Tower room with a pool view. I also saw a few other Palace Tower rooms that others in my party were using. All of these rooms had two queen beds and very well-appointed. Beds are comfortable bathrooms are large and there is room to sit and work. Depending on the room you either get a bathroom with two sinks or a bathroom with two separate sinks and toilets with the shower accessible from either side. If you are staying with a friend (not a spouse) it's nice to have two separate toilets.    The Augustus Tower is nearest to the Front Desk and the Strip entrance. The Palace Tower is very far from the Strip entrance (but it is near the pool). For some reason the area near the Palace Tower elevators had an unpleasant smell of sewage. Once you're in the elevator this is no longer a problem. The Palace Tower rooms are less expensive I assume due to the walk and the views.    I have read many comments about the minibar and was successful in not touching anything and getting billed for it.    Diamond privileges are nice. You can avoid the queue at Starbucks and other establishments. There's a separate Diamond/Seven Stars check-in area near the Augustus Tower elevators where you can get complimentary coffee and cold water. Most importantly you get valet parking for no charge and the resort fee is waived.    Caesar's is more expensive than most hotels on the Strip but I like it a lot for both the location and for the quality and relative quiet that the rooms provide. With Diamond status it makes it a decent value for the price.
50,Always a fun place to visit and just get lost in the old school feel of Caesars Palace. The shops and atmosphere always suck you in for more. Couldn't ask more of a place with such amazing ambience worldly food and of course amazing gambling.
50,Had a great time with a great room and very friendly knowledgeable employees! The employees and the atmosphere is one of the main reasons we stay true to Caesars. Gaming is not as fair as it used to be but good variety of machines.
40,Beautiful place and clean. Checked on us everyday to see if we needed anything. Friendly and room service was very fast. Restaurants were amazing. Absolutely loved mr chow. Will definitely be my next place
40,We stayed at another property. We always go by Ceasars when we go to Vegas which is 1-2 times a year. Between the last two times we were in Vegas it seems as if Ceasars has done a better job of organizing the slot machine locations so they are not so spread out!
50,Excellent in every way! Very enjoyable and exciting! Good atmosphere and surroundings. Great casino games/high limit choices. Good restaurants and awesome staff. Very good choice of shopping with some high end shops>
10,Wife and I spent two nights in the Palace Tower (16th floor) and woke up each morning with multiple bug bites on legs. The staff's response to this was muted snark coupled with aloof disregard. For nearly $1000 (both nights) we had the displeasure of being feasted upon by 6 legged critters which suggests the exorbitant room charges did not include a budget for rudimentary cleaning. This is an overpriced subpar property trading on its legacy. A fancy dump if you will.
50,Beautiful property; great rooms and staff!    You have many choices for relaxation great food and gambling. Ceasars is always my first choice for staying in Vegas - particularly during the week when you don't have quite the crowds that you see on weekends. The various bars - particularly Vista - have great bartendars and fix a mean cocktail! You will absolutely have a great trip when you stay at Ceasars!
50,Really enjoyed the stay. Grea room and food. Enjoyed the stores and just walking around. Staff was super nice and very helpful. Would love to go back again soon. Such a relaxing place and fun. Really nice
50,Caesars Palace was an outstanding place for our annual meeting. We had meetings and seminars all day going into the night. With the abundance of great restaurants it was easy to work late and get to dinner quickly.
50,Caesars Palace staff were very accommodating to our party‚Äôs every needs. Everyone was very knowledgeable and helpful. The dining on this property was incredible and the update rooms that we stayed in were amazing. Can‚Äôt wait to go back!
50,Went to see Journey. The concert was awesome. The hotel was perfect! 5 stars only because realistically you dont go any higher!  Best get some comfortable walking shoes the place is huge and so much to see!!
50,Amazing staff delicious food great drinks definitely my place for Vegas my wife and two of our friends had a great time this past weekend looking forward for are next stay definitely staying at Caesars palace...!!!
20,If you are a seven star don't bother visiting this resort/casino. We came here for a seven star retreat for the second year and there is a huge decline in a service and experience. This rude awakening started with the check-in experience where they couldn't accommodate any of our requests. VIP hosts declined all requests and wanted to charge us extra; maybe because we are Canadians??? Then they checked us in a dirty room (not cleaned after the previous guests). Finally we got the cleaned room. At this point the initial disappointment and frustration was further built up by the lack of service when you are playing machines. My hubby and I literally played for over 2 hours without anyone stopping by to offer a drink. I had to go and look for a drink myself. Then had to chase housekeeping to clean the room calling multiple times one day. Overall experience very poor.    In summary if you are a seven star don't expect a decent experience with this retreat. We visited other resorts for seven stars and this experience was by far the worst.    I usually don't write a negative reviews this is my second one. However it's a very disappointing experience especially since this trip marks my hubby's and mine 15 year anniversary.
50,Great room looking over pool area clean and very quiet! Would appreciate it if there were more outlets by the bed to plug in one or 2 devices. Bed was comfortable everything was clean and pleasant. Would definitely stay there again! One of my favorites.
30,I understand that a casino‚Äôs purpose is to part you from your money. But does everything every single thing have to be overpriced or an extra charge? Do your room coffee pod need to be $13? Does the hotel vending machine have to sell $4 water? Does a salad and pasta dish have to be $55? Does the resort fee have to be $45 per day?    The fees aren‚Äôt the issue. Charge me a fair price for the room. I can take it. Vegas is expensive and I know that going in. But treat me with respect. Don‚Äôt nickel and dime me. Don‚Äôt have me check in via kiosk with printed directions to my room. Don‚Äôt make me feel like a numbered revenue source.    Vegas is about fantasy. Make me feel like Caesar if only for a few minutes.
50,Fast and accurate service. Comfortable casino chairs clean casino and excellent restaurants. Cigar bar is amazing! The food and drinks combined with comfortable couches televisions and fast service were top notch!
50,A very nice  clean hotel . The room we stayed was very nice . So clean ! Although the restaurant was quite expensive but the food was ok . The slot machine were very tight to win . But we enjoyed the Journey Band concert
30,Rooms are overrated and still overpriced. I‚Äôd rather spend the money at the newer casinos. Dealers and pit bosses are fun and engaging. Would come back just to play with them again. They were very attentive to my needs.
50,The stay was amazing. Caesar's Palace is a destination that everyone should experience. The staff was very friendly the table games were fair and the atmosphere in there felt vey welcoming. I definitely recommend anybody going to Vegas to stay here
40,We didn‚Äôt stay here while in Las Vegas but we did visit the Bacchanal buffet and the casino. The buffet was very expensive didn‚Äôt serve king crab as we expected and only allowed a two hour visit but we enjoyed the food available and the service was very good. We would love to stay here in the future.
50,A little overwhelming for us small town people but had a great time. Excellent place to see a concert. The room and the concert venue were very nice though having Donnie Osmund staring at us in our room was disconcerting. :)
50,Birthday weekend for the wife with friends staff gave us the VIP treatment  definitely the place to go in Vegas. All dealers very helpful and friendly and Sherry our host is the best her and her staff will make you feel like a king
50,professional people very helpful  knowledgeable and showed expertise on their job . Place is highly recommended for stay especially if you are with family gatherings  lots of excellent restaurant and the buffet is exceptional.
50,My room was awesome very large and clean the jetted tub was amazing I spent most of my time inside. The room was beautifully decor bed was super comfy most days I just slept in for hours. No complaints
10,Traffic noise light out in bathroom remote did not work. When we complained we were met with rudeness. We had to get the housekeeping manager to our room for the desk manager to believe us about how noisy our room was.
50,Fantastic atmosphere ! A must see resort. A little overwhelming ...this place is a city within a city. You need 3 days to get your bearings .  Go. Enjoy. Guaranteed - you'll have fun and most likely come back refreshed and broke
50,Location is prime and convenient.  Safe organized and overall a fun place to play stay and party!!  All questions one might have are handled promptly and very informative. Premium drinks are included during play with quicker than normal service.
50,This casino is fabulous it is very big has lots of shopping dining gaming shows and has great beverage service. Has a great international buffet with food from all over the world! On my recent trip I saw a lot of jackpots paid in slots!
50,I had been in Vegas for past 35 years. This is my best casino rating over all. Very friendly and helpful all employees. I was drunk and lost don‚Äôt even remember my room number. The security guard helped me to find room number and kindly walk with me to my room make sure I am ok. That‚Äôs awesome.
50,Like always everything was great love it there! Always a clean room most comfortable beds friendly staff from check in Valet to housekeeping great dining great time gambling hope to go back soon.
50,Great trip and wonderful stay as always at Caesars! Diamond checking staff Michelle in particular are amazing. She is cheerful efficient and goes the extra mile to make our stay special. She is the kind of employee that all casinos/hotel strive to hire and can be proud of. Will seek her out again next year! Housekeeping did a great job also. All staff helpful and courteous at this casino/hotel.
40,You can tell by the size and cleanliness of the rooms the popularity of the pool and casino games the highly rated dining options the convenient location on the strip and the amazing service that this place pays close attention to detail and customer satisfaction which makes it highly coveted and highly rated...
50,The rooms are beautiful and spacious with a beautiful view of the pools. The restaurants in the Caesars hotel are awesome. I would highly recommend this hotel on the strip for players. The shopping is spectacular at the forum shops with great name brand store‚Äôs.
50,I had a first class mini suite room with easy access to the pool & casino floor. The dealers at the Dice tables were professional and friendly and the pools were refreshing. The bellmen/valet personnel were excellent with storage of our golf clubs.
40,Service was good for the most part; our shower door didn't open and we had to call the front desk 3 times to get someone to come and fix. The snack bar was more of a nuisance; I accidently knocked over something and placed it back in its place but was charged for the item when I checked out. I had to get someone to remove the charge for me.
50,As always my stay at Caesars was excellent. The staff and rooms are always comfortable and clean. We had food at various restaurants and it did not disappoint. I would recommend to anyone who wants to stay in one of the finer hotels in Vegas.
50,Caesars makes you remember old time Vegas service and gambling. Really enjoy my time there . I have been many times and will return many more. Try to get a room overlooking the Bellagio fountain to enjoy the show.
50,My experience with Caesars was great. Food was excellent Diamond area staff was excellent. Water & Grill restaurant in Caesars is the best. The casino wasn't giving as much as I used too but I guess you should go only for fun in there anyway. :-)
40,Had a great time at Caesar's Palace Usually stay at another Caesars Resort when in Vegas but decides to stay here. I wasn't disappointed at the least very friendly staff the rooms where very clean and fairly updated great pool. The only thing I could suggest is the Casino floor could you some updating but that is very minor.
50,Very nice place to stay Great staff. The check in was easy and the staff was very helpful and willing to take time to give information on the hotel places to eat pool locations ect. Rooms are large and very nice.
50,We had a great time with our friends at this casino. The staffs were friendly. The casino is beautiful and large with many high-end shops. The food/restaurants are great too. We had fun taking pictures in this casino.
50,Front desk team member Anselmo was awesome and helped us out so much! Got our group in same tower! It is a lot of walking though and when you book with a group try to get same towers.. Not my favorite hotel but front desk guy was awesome help!
30,The room was clean but very beat up. Every piece of furniture was scratched and very worn. Not what one expects at this price point. Holiday Inn Express had better appointed rooms. They even had the nerve to charge for K-cups to make coffee in the room.
10,You couldn‚Äôt pay me to stay here again. I was looking forward to this trip for a work conference and my sister was coming in to watch my baby. We arrived around 1. I understand that a room might not be ready but it was almost 5 before we were in and our bags delivered. That‚Äôs when things really went downhill. We were ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù for a fee to a Smokey run down room. I have stayed in hostels in 3rd world countries that were nicer. The worst part was the smoke. It turns out that their non-smoking rooms are smoking optional. All of us felt sick. I spent an hour at the front desk trying to resolve things only to be charged double what we agreed to was fair compensation for the inconvenience. Then we vacated the room for the whole morning for them to clean and it made no difference. This made me miss conference events and have a cranky baby. They nickel and dime you for everything like a discount air carrier might. Other hotels are not this bad. I travel every other week. There is no escaping the smoke. The pack and play was disgusting. The carpet was fraying. There was visible damage to the furniture everywhere. Finally I made a vow not to do any reviews when I had my baby 10 months ago because I don‚Äôt have the time. I have been ripped off and had terrible experiences in that time but this terrible experience is what made me come out of retirement. Just don‚Äôt do it
50,When I first time went to there  oh I think it is amazing! It is so big so beautiful and they have many nice restaurants inside! The food is super delicious I love it so much!  The staff over there are very nice and the service is excellent! I will be back!
20,There seemed to be no staff available whenever I tried to speak to someone throughout my stay. Check in queue was very long with only three staff at reception it took 20 minutes before I managed to get to the front of the line. Paid almost $300 per night for 4 nights. My room was run down with chipped furniture the electric drapes would not open hairdryer plug was cracked. Overall really poor. Coffee $15 for 4 pods!! Wi-fi very patchy and only two devices per room allowed. So unimpressed I moved after two nights to another hotel.
50,Love this place. Historic and timeless property that is well maintained.    Wonderful marble and bronze sculptures.    The outside grounds around spectacular    Home of plenty of excellent places to eat and show venues. Note that the tent for Absinthe is not in the building proper but between the building and LV Boulevard.    I never see long lines for check in so kudos.    Per the web it has 3976 rooms so it is a big place.    Cons  Signage good but not great. I asked directions from security guard Craig and he was friendly and spot on.
20,...except for separating you from as much of your money as is possible.    OK. It‚Äôs Las Vegas. We get it. The problem with Caesar‚Äôs Palace is that they seem convinced that they can perennially slide by on a once excellent reputation and stupid people will simply continue to throw money at them just like in the old days. Well the stupid among you are welcome to do just that. Go for it! Those of us with a brain may choose another option. I prefer to receive a modicum of value even when I‚Äôm spending my company‚Äôs money and certainly when I‚Äôm spending my own. Not much value to be had at Caesar‚Äôs any longer.    First the good: I was really impressed by the elevators. They are fast and well programmed. Kudos for those. Not much more to say that‚Äôs positive. The rest of my stay was below mediocre.    Now for the bad: Their people and the management apparently could give a rat‚Äôs buttocks about the hotel patrons. My check-in experience was dreadful. The room (Type) that I bought and paid for was not provided. When the manager was called over it was further obvious that he was annoyed that he had to be interrupted by a lowly guest. Yeah the nerve of me!    Then there are the rooms; quite aged outdated and overall pretty sad. Many of the CFLs (yep not even LEDs) we‚Äôre burned out throughout the room. There were scarcely any electrical outlets save for those that were in use behind furniture (can you say ‚Äú1080s room design?). Housekeeping was spotty (in 4 days my room was made up only twice ‚Äî the second time only after I called ‚ÄúGuest Services‚Äù and complained; oh and when I spoke with ‚ÄúGuest Services‚Äù I requested a call back from a member of management. Yeah I‚Äôm still holding my breath). So the service stinks but that‚Äôs probably appropriate because the place stinks ‚Äî literally. Yeah I know it‚Äôs a casino and people smoke. Why then do the other major casinos not smell like the bottom of an unwashed ash tray. Perhaps it‚Äôs because Bellagio or Bally‚Äôs or Winn‚Äôs etc. actually give a hoot about their places and have decent ventilation systems. Go ahead and step into that noisome stench-laden casino. I did my gambling next door at Bellagio ‚Äî a far far more pleasant experience.    I could go on for days here about overpriced everything and indifferent bellmen and dirty hallway carpets and cold room service trash but you get the picture right.    Well the elevators worked great. That‚Äôs something!    Lots of other choices on The Strip. Might I humbly suggest that you explore one?
50,Anytime I go to Vegas I don‚Äôt think about staying anywhere but Caesars palace it‚Äôs always the best atmosphere and all the options for food and shopping are second to none. The rooms are always clean and the pool area is great.
50,Caesar‚Äôs is a great resort to stay at in Vegas. I was treated very well and they by far have the best perks once you are established. Free rooms free play free food and we also did a free comedy show. Room was spacious and clean and the dining options are great. 5 stars as far as I‚Äôm concerned. I‚Äôve stayed at many different resorts there for 20 straight years now and Caesar‚Äôs is definitely one of the best.
10,Room looks like it was last updated and cleaned in 1987 the room service food was terrible and way over priced. Very few tables available and a general low morale from staff. The whole experience was the worst I have ever had in Vegas in the last 30 years. How the mighty have fallen.
50,Came here on a family trip for my parents‚Äô anniversary and Caesar‚Äôs has been the best! Woo!! Tangela checked us in and was so kind. Really started the trip off fabulously! Excited to explore this beautiful resort.
40,The hotel is very nice with well renovated rooms (I stayed at two different ones) in the Palace tower. This tower is nice and close to the conference area. However the Palace tower hallway between the pool and the division between going to the conference escalators or the shopping area had a persistent stench of vomit and sewage. When we inquired from the soap and bath product shop that is in the middle of this stinking area they said it's the pool sewage that is causing it and there is nothing they can do about it. That I found unacceptable. The line ups for check in are typically ridiculous so the self-check in stations are lovely to have. The pool at the palace tower is wonderful.
50,1st class all the way.... Julia in the Augustus Tower check in desk was simply amazing. She was very professional and accommodating. Pool area and Beverage and Food experience was incredible. Dine at Bobby Flay's restaurant Mesa Grill while you are there. The Porterhouse Lamb Chops are excellent. If you are staying on the Strip....Look no further.    Adam Miller the Director of Operations was very helpful as well during my stay. His leadership definitely pulled throughout his staff's ability to give genuine hospitality.
50,Casino Is high energy clean lots of slots you had the Buffalo Zeus Kronos and Wheel of Fortune just to name a few. Buffet was awesome wish I could have eating there more. Cocktail waitress were nice and sweet. Just wish I got her name so I could put it in here.
50,The room was a long way from registration. Once making it to the room it was easy to get to everything else. The room could use more comfortable chairs. Although the room was a suite we only used the bedroom. It had a TV in the living room so people could have watched different programs. Loved the TV in the bathroom mirror.
50,We had an awesome experience. The concierge even text us to provide support. Whatever we need including extra towels disposable toothbrushes or comb they brought them up to us. Feel really special. My son really likes the pool there.
10,First off my booking was not made correct when I called ceasers entertainment was offered two days complimentary stay plus Halloween tickets and 40$ of table play and only received one night no table play then had to spend the next day of my vacation on the phone with ceasers entertainment all day to receive no help and nothing but frustration when asking management to help correct the situation no options were offered and nothing but disrespect and attitude when the problem is with your service yes of corse i will be mad to call security when you were asked to stay there in the first place I think is a joke you make millions of dollars it makes zero since to not work with a customer please contact me if you ever want my business or friends family business again
40,I attended a conference for work here and my room was great and clean. It had a good view and overall I was happy with it. I was annoyed that I had reserved a room with a king but was given a room with two queens. Not a huge deal but given that I had made the reservation 5 months ago I'm just confused as to why I didn't get my initial reservation.
50,This was our first time to Caesars Palace. We stayed in a great room overlooking the Strip and the Bellagio Fountains. Every member of Caesars staff that we interacted with were very friendly and quick to help us with our needs. The friendliness and greetings we received while vising Caesars Palace was no surprise we are accustomed to the friendly atmosphere of all Caesar's properties we visit.
50,Went to Vegas to see Journey for my Birthday!! Thank you Caesar‚Äôs Palace for a wonderful weekend! I enjoyed dinner at Rao‚Äôs and of course breakfast daily at All American Grill.    The room was very nice and very clean. I had an amazing view of the water show at Bellagio.
20,Spent hours on the phone months before our visit sure that we had the proper reservations. We booked in the Julius. Hours and arriving at 2 AM the reservation system was down so they need to manually. No problem! We were booked a room Augustus tower no problem. But when we arrive today were two queen bed‚Äòs. When we called down to ask for a switch we were told there was not one making available in the end higher hotel. We were told to check back in the morning. We went down to the front desk to ask for assistance not only were they on helpful but not concerned at all about our request. We went back down in the morning and was told again there are no king rooms in the entire establishment. We are here for 10 days spending lots of money not only were they not helpful but not at all apologetic or concerned. Very disappointing I am a platinum card holder as well which clearly isn‚Äôt good enough to get any type of assistance. The room we are stuck in is not only not what we booked but also dirty. The phone is so dusty and coated with goo that you can‚Äôt even read it and there is dust under every item in the room. I expected so much more. There customer device is non existent
40,We came to Las Vegas to celebrate our anniversary. We've been Las Vegas many times but stayed in Caesars Palace for the first time. We booked an upgraded room because the website mentioned it was upgraded. We weren't disappointed. Although the room has a partial view of the strip it was spacious clean and a huge renovated bathroom. The location is good walking distance to everywhere on the strip. However our room was in the Palace tower which is the farthest tower from the lobby. The lady at the check-in desk didn't explain to us about the tower didn't show the map (I saw other hotel personnel explained to the guest on how to get to their room). She simply said we needed to go left of the lobby and the elevators were by the pool. It took us a while to figure out what tower our room was. The direction indication came up after a halfway through. Also the Self-parking direction wasn't shown from the lobby. I have to say it's a huge hotel but route indication can be better While I enjoyed our stay the hefty resort fee only granted two devices to access wifi. Each additional device connecting to wifi will cost 14.99$ a day. We are in a digital world and the hotel charges for wifi connection? This doesn't reflect a modern world image. On top of that the resort fee doesn't include parking. So be prepared for all the extra fee we need to pay for the stay. Check-in is a pain because of the long waiting line. Check-in hour is also too late: 4 pm.
40,We have stayed here multiple times and always enjoy the beautiful pools abundance of restaurants and shopping the nice spacious rooms and that there are TWO Starbucks :)! The beds are really comfortable too.    The waitresses are usually quick and efficient as well when gambling which is nice too.
30,I was disappointed that my room was not clean. The sheets on the bed looked like someone had taken dirt and streaked it across the bed. After the coordinator from our team contacted the hotel I was sent a nice bottle of wine as an apology. Would rather had clean sheets!
50,Definitely had my choice of hotels but Caesar‚Äôs Palace just has something about how they treat everyone it‚Äôs always fun I‚Äôm so happy that I I got the opportunity to be here for my friends bachelorette
50,You guys are the best. I‚Äôve had been to many hotels and Casinos on Las Vegas Nevada. I found Cesar Casino is beautiful and cleanliness. All staff are nice and friendly especially Janet Nguyen. I appreciate all of you!
50,I honestly am just writing this review for Catharine at the front desk. She was amazing and was a life savor. I got stuck in Vegas for work for an additional night very last minute and booked through Hotel Tonight (don't ever use). Catharine stayed with me for 30 minutes while I was on hold with Hotel Tonight and helped me to sort out the issue. She immediately was all over the issue - from speaking with her manager to offering to speak to Hotel Tonight for me on the phone she was fantastic. Thanks Catharine!!!!!
50,Fun fun and lots of fun. Wish i could‚Äôve brought some money home but oh well what can you do. Food was amazing and the atmosphere was incredible. We are going back in December again I hope. Viva Las Vegas
10,All lines were extremely worn out mini bar would never open even after calling long walk to the room smelled like barf the entire stay. Walls are super thin and you could hear everything going on in the rooms surrounding you. I would never recommend this hotel or stay there again.
50,The room was amazing. The service was amazing. The hotel is the best in vegas! Definitely this hotel met our needs and more! We will come back to Ceasers palace again for sure. You must stay here if you go to vegas.
50,Caesars has gaming shopping eating and drinking all in one place. All are high quality and there‚Äôs a variety from low to high price to choose from. Location is easy walk to other shopping and gaming locations.
50,Perfect location.. amenities great.. room clean and we'll appointed... Sports book huge with plenty of seating.. restaurants top notch and of course crazy choices in mall.. you can find high end items here!
10,This past weekend we spent 2 nights at Caesars Palace we booked this 7 months ago. They closed 4 pools for the entire day for an evening event. I watched them set up and it took less than 3 hrs. They should have opened the pools to 3 pm closed them and set up for their EVENING event. but NO they closed them to over 5000 paying guests who way over paid for their rooms. We were all to use 1 one tiny pool with no available chairs and over 100 people drinking and you know (peeing) in the petree dish of a pool. Every staff member we spoke to said it was not their fault and nothing could be done. This is an overpriced non- friendly OLD hotel and we will never drop a dine in this place again. Going back to our favorite hotel and staying where my hard earned $$ is appreciated
40,I've stayed in almost all of the top casinos on the strip and Caesars falls in the middle. The newer ones have larger rooms and a more modern feel but there is still something about Caesars that draws you in. I like that I was able to find $15 blackjack tables where others only offer $25 mins in the evenings. Best advice is to ask in advance which tower you will be staying in because there are big differences between the Deluxe and Premium rooms.
50,Amazing room. Delano helped us check in and he was awesome!!!! Would recommend ceasars to anyone coming to vegas! The location on the strip is perfect right in the middle. The pool is luxurious with yummy drinks.
50,"I got a great deal through Southwest vacations. I've never stayed at The Flamingo before. I had a king room. I like the size. It's perfect for two people. I had a good view of the High roller. I kina wish there are a microwave but it would ""cheese"" up the room. If you are not a messy person skip room service and get $10.00 in food credit. It'll pay for a couple trips to the Espresso bar."
50,Very comfortable room the location is suitable to all places we want to see helpful employees and accomodatingthe shopping is accessible and the theater is very convenient good slots good service
50,From the cleaning crew on up super friendly and helpful. The place is well kept and spotless and the price was great because i booked months in advance. The location was great and allowed us to walk to anything we wanted to do
50,Amazing staff!! The 7 star valet and laurel lounge employees are amazing and always make me feel home. Also the poker room staff is the best on the strip! They always remember me and make gambling so fun even when I lose!
50,The spa is the best I‚Äôd ever seen. The games were fun. Felt safe. Food and drink was yum. pistachio cannoli at a walk up Italian joint. The buffet looked incredible and is on the list for next time go early though.
50,Caesar's Palace Las Vegas is in my opinion the absolute overall best hotel in Las Vegas! It does not matter if you are vacationing for a wedding bachelor party anniversary birthday event celebration etc. Caesars Palace will provide you with one of the best experiences of your lifetime. I highly recommend enjoying a morning at Qua Spa for a couples Kama Sutra with Shirodhara massage to ease your way into tranquility and perfectly smooth skin while feeling relaxed to enjoy your favorite casino games. Then indulge in one of the many upscale restaurants: Nobu Gordon Ramsay Hell's Kitchen Mr. Chow (restaurants I have experience within the last year) and enjoy a show. I plan on going back to Las Vegas one more time before the end of 2019. Hands down no questions asked I recommend staying at Caesar's Palace Las Vegas for memorable exciting and luxurious vacations in Las Vegas.
50,My husband and I planned a trip to see Journey for our 36 th wedding Anniversary it was great. The room was beautiful and maid and staff very knowledgeable.: Will be staying there again in December for Reba and Brroks and Dunn
50,room was great. customer service was excellent. we attended halloween bash last Saturday was entertaining and fun. food was excellent. We had do much fun. i will recommend ceasars palace to my family and friends
20,First time in vegas and was really disappointed in customer care i thought the slogan was all about the guests but honestly none of the staff cared. If you asked question basically were met with an attitude and or the staff would consult with each other as you were left standing. Horrible customer service obviously gorgeous hotel.
50,Beautiful casino  Great perks  Great staff  We took our son for his 35th birthday. The laughter and memories was the greatest for us.l would recommend family and friends and anyone that travels to laff Vegas to visit crasars.
40,it was a great experience loved the property.stayed at Paris.It was a very busy weekend and we were very well treated.The only thing i wanted that we could not get a room with a view of the strip.everything else was beyond our expectations.Thanks for a great trip.
50,Caesars is a classic casino with much to see and do in the heart of the strip. Table games affordable to all and unlimited slots. Fine dining and great atmosphere. Always one of my stops when in town.
40,Beautiful and spacious  Lots of tables and slots machines  Different varieties of games to choose  The stuffs were friendly and helpful.  Just that the table games minimum bets are set slightly higher than the other Caesar rewards hotels.  Overall experience: Great
50,I am very please for the hosts and caged customers service. They are very helpful for credit line and foods for myself. I am happy with the casino dealer i lost some money overall this is my best experience in Las Vegas. I hope next year my team going again.
50,Caesars Palace once again rules! From the greeting in the Diamond Club check in to my departure all was good! I would like to especially give a shout out to Jeremy in the Diamond Club who went out of his way to honor my early check in as well as tried to get my friends in rooms near me. Mostly Caesars needs to be commended for always trying to be relevant in an industry that is constantly changing.
40,They do a great job in the upkeep of the facilities the rooms were very clean and comfortable. Wonderful spa with several jacuzzi's and comfortable relaxation area. Lots of dining choices and a full buffet.
50,Had a wonderful time at Caesars for my husbands birthday. We stayed in a premium suite and it was amazing. We usually stay in the Augustus Tower. This time we stayed in the Octavius Tower. It's a longer walk but the room was great and it had a great view of the pool area. I've stayed at several properties in Vegas and I like Caesars best for the location. It has the best access to shopping restaurants and entertainment.
40,"Caesar's Palace is a beautiful property with large well arranged rooms. The staff is great casino staff is awesome and you can even ""win"" in the casino. It's very busy though so don't be surprised if you can't get to your favorite machine or table right away."
50,I had a wonderful time at Caesar's Palace! It is a very nice Hotel and Casino! It was very clean and that is important to me. Also everywhere I went I didn't smell cigarettes. The sports bar is also nice but too crowded on game days It could use more seats!
50,I love the room at Ceasar's especially in the Augustus tower it is very roomy and clean. It has a dual sinks and the toilet is separated. There's a lot of spots where you can on the gaming area. Lot's of new machines and variety to choose.
50,Had a wonderful time celebrating our 5oth Anniversary at Caesars Palace. Great Room Great Meals and a Great Show. All the employees that we met during our stay went out of their way to be extremely helpful and thoughtful. We had a wonderful time.
50,Stayed at a suite at Caesars under PER my sister's treat ( once in a BLUE moon ) ordered Dom Perinon Champagne and fell asleep. Woke up ate at the Japanese place and ordered Madame Butterfly drink played slots and danced at the Cleopatra's Barge  Had some photos taken. Played live keno.Had meal again at coffee shop. The next day had buffet and played some more slots. Too expensive for me to do some shopping because I didn't win but I enjoyed my time alone. I love myself that is why whenever I choose to go somewhere I make it a point to be happy about it especially at CAESARS PALACE LAS VEGASNEVADA. I prefer not to leave town this time around. I highly recommend the place and the people who works there. Maria G. Christa
40,This was our first time to stay at Bally's. The renovated room was nice and the staff was friendly. We liked the casino and the central location. It also made it easier to get around since it's attached to the monorail.
50,This hotel is beautiful. The staff was exceptionally friendly especially Emma at the front desk that made sure we were happy with our room. It also has a great selection of restaurants and a beautiful casino. We will be back
50,We have used TripAdvisor and stayed at Caesar own hotels every time we come to Las Vegas. The staff are friendly and educated on the current shows restaurants and even museums. We are into horror and scary movies and a dealer told us about the hunted museum right off the strip. We had a blast and our friends are going this week to view it! Thank you all for a stress free experience.
50,Pleasure to deal with all employees I encountered. Such a great experience can‚Äôt wait to go back. The ease of checking in to finding out information on the property made my experience incredible. Highly recommend
50,Room was spacious and clean. There were many places to eat and food overall was very good. The valet parking was convenient. Many new slot machines. Had a wonderful time. My family members were able to meet me this trip and they all had a great time.
50,A first impression is everything. Michelle is an extremely warm welcoming individual at the Diamond/Seven Stars check in. Very efficient while also engaging to talk to. I also love the food at Mesa innovative complex flavors just the right amount of heat. The new face up Pai Gow table is a hit at Cromwell across the street but it is nearly always jammed with a waiting line. A number of great dice dealers at Cromwell as well including a great pit crew in particular Vince.
50,Stayed in the Palace Tower and room was very nice and updated. The jacuzzi tub was great after walking for miles in the casino and strip. The shops had a wide selection of upscale items. Little disappointed in the price of bottled water. This is the desert and you must stay hydrated. Seems funny that you will give me FREE liquor in the casino but charge over $5 for a bottle of water in the gift shop.
40,Positive service. Excellent service and willing to help. Clean room respectful attendants. Food is tasty and well laid out staff attention to details respectful. always with a smile. Property is clean.
50,Our flight out of Vegas got canceled after spending all day in the Airport. We called Caesars and were immediaterly accomodated.  When we arrived Wilfred was courteous  professional and gave us a great room to help make up for our stressful day.    We will be back in Feb with a large family group and will definitely be staying at Caesars!
50,The room was large and lovely with a great view of the pool area. The property itself was large and impressive. All of our interactions with staff were friendly and very helpful especially the check in process.
40,The room was nice an quiet. Service was great. My only complaints is that you can't use the refrigerator to store your own drinks. Also there is a lot of smoking going on in the Casino which is not very comfortable to be around.
50,My wife and I had a spontaneous evening away since our son was staying the night with family. Originally we were going to go to San Diego but room rates were too high. By accident I checked what kind of rates my wife and I could get in Vegas and we had a comp at Caesars. So we decided to go there. We were helped by Wilfred at the Diamond registration desk. He did a fantastic job and was able to make adjustments for our room. The room was great and we had a fantastic view of the Bellagio fountain. We had never stayed at Caesars Palace before. The property is fantastic the visuals everywhere inside and out are beautiful. We ate at Hell Kitchen for dinner the food was fantastic well worth the visit. We also had a lite night snack at the Americano cafe tasty. We didn‚Äôt play too much at the casino only because the table minimums are a bit high for our liking but we did pull some slots. We had a fantastic one night trip and we would consider staying there more often if we could get more comp‚Äôd nights at this property.
30,We spent 4 days at Caesar‚Äôs Palace to gather with family. We stayed in the Forum Tower. It is a huge place! Everything was so overpriced. $195 resort fee per night which did no5 even include 1 K cup for the Keurig or a bottle of water. The casino is very big and noisy and the cigarette smoke was unexpected. We spent a fortune on breakfast for 6 people. It is insulting to be so taken advantage of. This was our 2nd and last trip to Vegas. Bellagio was much nicer. Lots of more reasonable places to travel to and less glitz.
50,All the employees I encountered at Caesars were welcoming helpful and courteous. Very friendly environment. And the property itself has so much you can do besides gamble. I enjoyed the shopping and the food at Hells Kitchen.
50,I loved the room! Very big clean and nice! Big bathtub and shower! Felt like a real mansion! Quick and easy check in and check out. Sad the pool was closed for an event. I would stay here again on my next trip!
30,We stayed in a one bedroom Suite in Augustus Tower Upon arrival my wife was putting clothes in the cabinets when the drawer cover hit her at her nose The design of drawers was misleading and instead of lower drawer both upper and lower opened together and the upper hit my wife nose and caused bruises giving us impression that it is broken . The matter was reported to authorities all our efforts in this regards then and later during and after the trip has been in answered.  We expected more attention from the hotel management.
50,Very clean room. Friendly service and a Keurig coffee maker in the room. Very convenient for my morning coffee.  The pool area is gorgeous.  Lots of assorted slot machines and that was good casino fun!
20,"Stayed at Caesars Palace likely never again...    The Good  - Room was nice view was good (Octavias floor 63 Belargio side)  - TV worked    The Bad  - Internet is trash its provided by COX inreception it worked (not to well) once in the room never worked and when it did had SSL errors (something was stripping SSL certificates from websites failing them loading)  : I did complain about this and the Hotel Manager gave me a passcode although the code works same issue with the internet which tells me theres an infrastructure issue (at least on the floor i was on).    - House Keeping we never had any we were offered to opt out every other day for a $10 credit well turns out it wasnt ""every other day"" it was the whole stay over 7 nights stay. Complained about this Tuesday (stay was from Sunday) Wednesday still no house keeping so called to have it done this was the only time we had house keeping  : Again i saw the front desk about this they say they ""resolved it"" on Tuesday however it was never fixed even though the front desk system says we should have house keeping it never happened over the whole stay    - Bad staff i wanted to see the manager on the last day to confirm the above complaints there was a large queue so i saw someone in the reception area (they had a suite on) and requested to see the manager as i have a number of large issues and didnt really have time to wait (as i had to meet others outside)  their advice was ""your need to que"" after i said this will likely result in me never staying again the sound and body language was ""oh well""... !!!  : Again i brought this up as we checked out an apology was made.    The above says to me there are some HUGE holes in the basic running of the hotel (Internet House keeping and staffing) we had issues the year before so appears this resort is traveling downhill fairly fast.    I do have the Hotel Managers contact card so will likely follow up with this as well."
30,Love the hotel but feel very let down by lack of attention to detail. No bath robes a huge inconvenience. The hotel stated it provided coffee making facilities but you have to pay for this. Views fantastic. Location the best on the strip. Great bars and restaurants.
50,Thisbisbabplace of wonder and enjoyment for all those seeking to go back into the olden days of Rome and whatnot! Its a staple of las vegas and hasn't changed since clCaesar himself walked the lands!!!!
50,Went for my cousins birthday weekend. Staying at Caesars Palace is always our preference. Thanks to Tangela at the front desk we had an easy check in and great adjoining rooms. We loved the view of the fountains and of course the jacuzzi tub. Great cocktail service while playing and good food court choices. We loved that it wasn‚Äôt too smoky and the location can‚Äôt be beat!
40,Everything was just right. The room was warm on the cold nights and the maid service was excellent in cleaning the room. Staff were very friendly and professional. Security was also accomodating  Service at the bar was also excellent.
50,Checked in for a 2-night staycation to attend a Joe Bonamassa concert. Had put in for a room upgrade prior to arrival with my lowest status Caesars card. Tomek checked us in and was professional attentive and went above and beyond the call of duty to get us a petite suite in the Palace Towers with a pool view that was clean and ready. The king bed was comfy and they accommodated request for feather pillows and an extra ice bucket. Food in the Americano restaurant cost $72 with tip for a regular American breakast and a stack of pancakes and 2 cups of coffee - a little steep but the food was hot and tasty. Server Brian was tops. Cost $30/day to valet park.
50,Excellent staff excellent room. Clean and classy. I‚Äôve always wanted to stay here since I was a kid and it totally delivered!! The view from the Augustus tower was incredible and we enjoyed Mr. Chow and the shows!
50,Great visit. Service was good. Encountered one rude worker at the buffet line. Registration line was moderate but moved fast. Upon check in I had several requests which were all met. Room carpet was dirty but everything else was good and in working order.
10,"We usually stay at Palazzo but decided to try Caesars because we were seeing a concert there. What an overpriced dive. On the one nice weekend in October they CLOSED the pool for an entire Saturday to set up for a night time event for haloween. They crammed hundreds of people into a tiny pool with not enough chairs. No apologies. No warning in advance that the pool wouldn't be available. There was vomit in public bathrooms. They nickel and dime you on fees you get nothing for. ""Express"" check in line was 45 minutes. Staff attitude was ""too bad if you're frustrated - we can't do anything about it."" If you're going to Vegas plenty of nicer resorts to choose from. Now I know why the owners are $26 billion in debt - they don't give a rip about hospitality!"
50,Always my favorite place to stay in Vegas. I was put in the forum towers the rooms definitely need an upgrade however I had a phenomenal view and I had a great stay! I will always come back to Caesars! Good luck!
40,Very nice hotel and their healthcare initiative of helping you get you 10000 steps in is successful. It is a very large property and you can easily get loss. They should provide property maps at check-in. Great service and best beds. Will stay again when my Company is paying for it! Love the restaurants and Forum Shops!
50,From Check In with Wilfred to check out our experience was first class all the way. Wilfred made sure that the 2 rooms we had were on the same floor and made sure all are needs were met! We stayed in the Augustus Tower with a wonderful view of the Bellagio. We enjoyed dinner at Homestead the food and service was outstanding. Looking Forward to spending New Years in Las Vegas
50,The experience at Caesars is always fantastic. Helpful friendly employees. Great food! I I was there to see Journey and enjoyed the concert very much. Always great entertainment. The rooms are beautiful and clean. I would recommend Caesars Palace to all of my friends.
40,Arrived at VIP check in around 2:30 pm and no line was helped right away. Front desk guy (Delano) was friendly courteous and professional. The room in Augustus tower was luxurious spacious and clean with view of the Strip and Bellagio fountains. I asked for a high floor close to elevators and got exactly that.
20,Not sure how you can call yourselves luxury when you only supply your bathrooms - even in the suites - with one ply tissue paper. It‚Äôs a great example of how Caesars REALLY operates.    My room was upgraded twice so you‚Äôd expect some indication of their supposed luxury but I consistently found it lacking. This place is riding on the reputation of its name hoping the guests don‚Äôt recognize the reality.    Everything comes at a high price. Even a regular hotel chain has free coffee makers in their room but be prepared to pay for this small amenity at Caesars. Parking too is expensive for paying guests. The refrigerator in the room is for Caesars to provide an avenue to charge additional but if guests touch it they will pay. We‚Äôve also never encountered such greedy slots before very unlikely to give up winnings.    The shampoo and conditioner are VERY cheap and left my hair stripped. I‚Äôve only ever experienced this once before in a little Midwest hotel. I didn‚Äôt expect it at Caesars where I paid more than $250 a night for my room. You‚Äôd think at that price one could at least expect two ply toilet paper and reasonable toiletries.    We were given a $10 credit for foregoing every day housekeeping only asking for towels when needed. This equaled $2 a day credit for us which ended saving Caesars a great deal more especially considering the credit was to be given AFTER we purchased food at one of their restaurants which were also overpriced.    Yes restaurants are all drastically overpriced. A breakfast sandwich and coffee was no less than $20 coffee alone couldn‚Äôt be found for less than $5 anywhere on the property. None of the food justified the price - even the better restaurants were greatly lacking.    Lastly don‚Äôt expect privacy at Caesars. I was surprised to be disturbed by a knock at my door for a ‚ÄúSafety Check‚Äù. Every day their protocol is to enter every guests room and use the room phone to report that there is ‚Äúnothing suspicious‚Äù. Every day. Regardless.    We will never stay at Caesars again after all the penny-pinching ridiculousness. Other hotels on the strip actually treat their guests as guests not as Caesars does - people from whom they have multiple opportunities to scam money at every turn.
50,My family and I checked in at Caesars palace we stayed there for 2 days and with those two days I knew the next time I want to be in the property it would be Caesars Palace. Amenities in the room was really nice my room was bigger that a normal size room and I was in awe of how big the bathroom was. I was very satisfied with my stay and I definitely would recommend Caesars Palace to my friends and family
30,The room as you walk in had a muggy (mildew) smell as well as the whole Palace towers entrance by elevators where places are carpeted. The front desk personnel was very unwelcoming and had no knowledge nor did she care to find out an answer for our questions and concerns about the property or additional amenities.
30,We tried this famed hotel during our Las Vegas trip and should have stayed at the Wynn. The check in was longer than the TSA line at an airport-almost as painful. The tower we stayed in was Octavious meaning stretch out before walking down the long corridor to the elevator. Our room was quiant but i noticed instantly that a guest before was creative and placed the ice bucket bag over the smoke alarm. Trying to figure out how the cordless phone took too long so i found a housekeeper. I explained to her about the room and what we found to avoid being penalized for tampering with the smoke alarm. She said that she would come down and see and then take care of it. We returned and the bag was still over the device. The handle to the shower came off as the small screw fell off some time before. The floor boards were scratched and marred showing extensive wear and tear; not coming back.
20,Caesar is a classic. It has established itself in name over the years with its Roman theme design and high end shops with the Forum Shops. It has many great Restaurants such as Gordon Ramsey Hell Kitchen and Nobu. It is a tourist magnet for sure.    The past three years I‚Äôve stayed at Caesar three times. Each time in a different tower. From Forum Tower to Octavius Tower or Augustus Tower    Caesar is showing its age and in many aspects falling behind hotels such as Aria and Cosmopolitan. Even an old classic like Bellagio at this point has some positives over Caesar.    The rooms are nice but in need of some TLC. The water pressure is the worst of any hotels I‚Äôve stayed at on the LV strips. The water trickle out in the shower and slowly pour out of the sink faucet. It‚Äôs depressing showering in there. The beds are comfortable with a nice light feathered comforter. The walls are peeling the forum tower was badly dated. It had a CD alarm clock! Who uses CD these days. Aria has a nice iPad like device which controls the room. Both of these hotels are priced in the same range. Day and night comparison. The room has your typical amenities but the Venetian gives you more like Q-tips. The room lacks ports. Especially by the bedside. No usb charging port or extra power ports. The desk also lack power ports.    The Casino floor is huge with plenty of open walking space. The sport betting area is covered with huge screens. A nice nightclub with great music blast the night. It does lack the variety and amount of slot machines. So many open spaces and empty unused cards table that could‚Äôve been converted to slots.    The air ventilations ok. Not as smoky as some other Casino like the Park MGM.    The parking cost 15.00 per night for self parking and 24 per night for valet. They do have some EV parking spaces close to the elevators but lack EV charging. The Venetian offer free parking and free charging. Aria offer free charging but there is a charge to park. Caesar needs to keep up and offer free EV charging at self parking!    The food court while I like casino that offer it similar to the Venetian the select meh. It‚Äôs ok and many of the venues open almost 24 hrs. 2:00 am hunger strike you can get foods.    Resort fee is one of the dumbest thing the hotel industry are doing. Especially when you don‚Äôt use the pool or gym or anything other then sleep and eat.    Unless Caesar do some improvements to the room quality I doubt I‚Äôll be staying here on personal occasions. For the price the Venetian Aria and Bellagio are better. For a decent room at lower price the flamingo Linq or Park MGM is better. The Park MGM has amazing shower water pressure!
50,The title of this review says it all. Well done Caesars. The rooms are great. The staff are first rate. Food options are varied. Entertainment is forts rate. It is truly worthy of being the flagship of the Hotel group.
30,The top bed sheet and 1 of the pillow was dirty I didn't called the service desk as we just came for 2 nights and already was tired from the drive and from the front desk guy experience so we just put the sheet and that pillow at the side. But still the cleaning was not great. The front desk person ( the first person we saw when we came to the hotel after long drive ) was terrible but after talk to the manager we got 45$ to spend just because how the front desk guy behaved. The spa cost additional money which is crazy while you pay 52$ resort fee per night. At least give me access to the spa ( not include treatment ) Other then that nice view big size room nice hotel ( little bit old but still good ) in the middle of the strip. First time in that hotel I was in other hotels before but still did the rewards card just in case will be back to the hotel or his partners. Hope to get the point from My stay even due i booked it via Expedia and not via the hotel site
40,We enjoyed our buffet supper. A nice variety of casino machines. The premises were nice and clean. Staff was friendly when questions were asked. We did stay at the hotel as we stayed at the Paris Hotel.
30,I stayed at Caesars in September while attending a conference. The rooms were large as was the bathroom (double vanity separate large tub and shower) with comfortable beds but they charge you extra for everything. There's a Keurig coffeepot in the room but they charge you $14 for the coffee pods. Really? I'm paying $300+ a night for a hotel and you can't even include the in-room coffee? If you want to get coffee elsewhere in the hotel the lines are extremiely long and a coffee a banana and a yogurt with fruit and granola cost $28. I arrived early in the day and my room wasn't ready (although you could pay extra to have a room right away) which was fine but they were supposed to call me when my room was ready and they never did. They have check in kiosks you can use which was better than waiting in the massively long line at the front desk. The hotel is immense and it's easy to get lost. You have to allot additional time to get anywhere knowing you'll probably get lost at least once in the process. There are many restaurants you could never leave the property if you didn't want to. Everything is designed so that you end up in the casino which I understand is the way it's done from a Vegas marketing perspective but I hope that this conference is never held here again.
50,The best rewards program!  Great time for myself the Qua spa is serenity personified!  Room had a beautiful view of the Strip and dancing Fountain across the street!  Caesars has all the things I need under one roof...  I needed a relaxing/chill out vacation before the madness of the ‚Äúholiday‚Äù seasons and Caesars fit the bill!  Great hotel/casino eateries shopping and shows!!!
50,Expectation expected. Expectation met! The entire staff was Awesome. We were able to really enjoy our time away and will be back for more. If you want everything at your fingertips go to Ceasars Palace.
50,My wife and I found the facilities to be great and entertainment and venues to be everything as advertised.Accommodations and rented rooms are very comfortable and worth the value.  Employee assistance was swift courteous and pleasant.
40,The whole place is beautiful but I only saw one person win anything significant the whole time I was there. It's not much fun if you lose a lot as fast as I did there. Otherwise I had a great time and would love to return.
50,Was another awesome visit & experience. Love that Harrah‚Äôs properties have dog friendly accommodations.  Beverage servers always available to please guest.  Food was great at Gordon Ramsey‚Äôs restaurant.
50,We had a massive room in the Augustus Tower overlooking the fountains at Bellagio and the bed was the most comfortable that I have experienced.  The room was kept spotless by Housekeeping and the facilities at Caesar's Palace are second to none.  Highly recommended!!
50,When we stayed there before the rooms were great. The staff was also friendly and helpful. The casino is big but they do not have enough waitresses. We hardly ever got any drinks. Overall Hotel is great.
50,Everything about this trip was unbelievable a good time haven't been in Las Vegas in 20 years it has changed a lot so much to do so much to see can't even scratch the surface in 3 days I highly recommend doing this with a group of friends.
50,Stayed in the Palace Tower - large room close to the pool - awesome time. We ate at Gordon Ramsey's as well as Vanderpump - good food and great service. Dealers at the blackjack tables made the experience even better.
30,parking is a challenge and a little pricey.restaurants cost almost as much to eat 1 meal in as the room cost for the day.A unless you smoke pot dont get the smoking room.Will probably never stay downtown again.
50,I loved the hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I stayed there because of the proximity to the Colosseum to see Keith. The reopening of the Colosseum is a great venue for concerts. Not a bad seat in the house. I like to do pit and that was a great size. Small and intimate. The only drawback was the stage is 6 ft tall. Please lower the stage for his upcoming 12 shows. Will be coming back :)
50,I spent the day at Caesars palace with my wife and we both had a wonderful time. The food and shops we all very nice and with so many slots it didnt feel crowded. We will surely come back on our next visit to Vegas.
50,Our family have a great time on this trip to Las Vegas. We stayed at Caesar‚Äôs Palace. My room was a Forum Suite and it was large and very clean. Weather was perfect in October. Hotel and casino was very accommodating. Will be back soon.
50,just have a trip to Las Vegas. We had a great time with kids at Caesar‚Äôs. Weather was nice. Hotel and casino was very accommodating. Everything was top knotch. We will be back soon in December. Nice play to stay!
50,Rooms are clean and comfortable. We had a suite with a couch which was nice to have with guest in our room. Hotel has all the amenities you will ever need. Beds are comfortable. Plenty of power sources for my work equipment.
40,Had a great time with kids for Fall Break at Caesar‚Äôs. Weather was perfect. Hotel and casino was very accommodating. Food was good. Got to gamble and win as well. We will be back with or without kids.
50,We have stayed in several hotels in Vegas but Caesar‚Äôs is our favorite! The location is perfect the pools are wonderful and the rooms are well appointed and comfortable. It also has a great selection of restaurants. We tried Mr. Chow‚Äôs on this visit and it was outstanding!
50,My room was a suite it was large very clean. Bathroom was large with double sinks separate bath tub from shower. Customer service was great. Food was excellent especially Toby Keith restaurant. I had a fabulous experience
50,A large group of us stayed at Caesar's as part of our semi-annual vegas trip. We try and rotate accomodations each trip however after our experience we may only be staying at Caesar's from now on. Everything was top knotch.
10,We showed up our first day to Vegas at 9am knowing we couldnt get a room until 4pm and so we just checked in and they held our bags for us but when we came back at 4pm our room still wasnt ready so we came back later and it still wasnt ready for us we never got in our room until 9pm it was a headache for us to even get a room and the staff at the front desk were rude we are not stay at this hotel ever again they treated us like we didnt belong at the hotel.. very inconvenienced to help us get a room and almost ruined our vacation..
40,We stay at the Paris Hotel. We light the room with the view and wasn't happy with the bed. Not very clean. I had to use the towel while lay in bed so I won't be bud bite. Since my husband didn't use the towel he was infected with scabies. That's terrible. Please be careful and change your sheets daily when new person is use it.
40,We stayed at the Paris and it was very clean and comfortable. The food is way overpriced as is everywhere in Vegas. The casino is clean but you will look far and wide for a drink lady at certain times of the day.
50,Caesars Palace is a first class establishment from the front lobby to the casino pools restaurants etc. The rooms were tastefully decorated and beds were very comfortable. Great choice of table games slots pretty much a slam dunk all the way around.
50,it's really nice to place to visit clean and friendly..  there's a lot of things to do like shopping and chilling gamble restaurants..etc..  i will come back again if i have a chance to visit.!!!
50,Old Vegas Vibe modern-day amenities. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Lots of action at the pools. Excellent variety of table games and slots. Terrific sportsbook--probably the best in Vegas.
50,wonderful experience and great staff. if you go to Vegas you need to stay at Caesars. From the moment they picked us up at the airport to the time we headed back home the staff made it special and made us feel welcome.
50,My room at Rio was comfortable and clean. I enjoyed the budffet and the staff.    The only thing is that it's off the strip (20 minute walk).    It was my first time at Rio and I plan on going again next year.
50,"Just stayed at Caesars Palace and what a fantastic hotel! As a Diamond member I arrived and was able to check in using the separate Diamond and Seven Stars Check in area. I was greeted warmly by Jay after having a stressful evening and he instantly made me feel at ease and worked tirelessly to make sure that my stay at Caesars Palace would be perfect! I was upgraded to the Augustus tower to a large Suite overlooking the Bellagio fountains! While the room design and layout could use some improvement the room was clean and Service was impeccable. Room Service was okay but way overpriced with some cookies milk a grilled cheese sandwich with onion rings and some ""buffalo"" wings (that lacked any sauce) costing $80. Upon checkout Valet required I have a physical Caesars Rewards card to waive the Valet Fee but they were able to eventually waive the fee on their end. Overall a great stay with hard working staff. Definitely planning to stay here next time I'm in town."
50,My wife and I stayed in Augustus tower room 4486. Awesome view of the Bellagio Fountain. Very clean room large bathroom. Minibar but no use of the refrigerator without penalty or charge. Nice TV. In room safe. My room was prepaid (comped) so that was nice (not very wise prepaying but that is the way it works). Also since I had diamond status avoided daily resort and $14.95 WiFi fees? Elevators were fast and no real delays with transport back and forth to the room. Qua Spa is pricey but very nice per my wife. The employees throughout the hotel were very nice and helpful whenever we interacted.
50,Caesars Palace has all the amenities you can ask for in a resort. All the fine dining shows and of course the excitement throughout the casino it makes for a memorable stay!    Some things are better left unsaid... it is Vegas baby!
50,Room was very spacious. Clean. And view was wonderful. Very professional employees. Great property all around.. Casino floor very upbeat. Was a very nice experience...it has been my 3rd time staying at Caesars and I will stay there when I return. Was in new tower which was wonderful.....
50,Clean room and Fun Experience! Everyone from the front desk to the food and beverage staff were very friendly and helpful. The card dealers in the casino were very good and did not try to rush you if you were just learning the games. I would book the trip there again.
50,All were excellent! I recommend Caesar's because of it's beautiful scenery proximity to great fine dining shops and the strip. The pool area is second to noon. There is energy and a positive buzz surrounding the property.
10,you expect high end when booking Caesars and that is DEFINITELY NOT WHAT YOU GET! The hotel loves to ‚Äúput lipstick on a pig‚Äù it‚Äôs nice and shiny on the outside but once you see the actual rooms you‚Äôll be disgusted. Our room was not only dirty and had dirty carpet but it looked like they hired inexperienced contractors to renovate the room. We came to a ‚Äúclean‚Äù room that had hair and rust in the tub had cracks through out their ‚Äúhigh end‚Äù molding wallpaper peeling off damaged furnishes everywhere tile in the bathroom that was literally leaning against furniture with no grout tape all over the walls bubbling in the wall paper from water damage with possible mold. On top of their low quality rooms they have terrible customer service. When the issues were brought up to the front desk they told us that they were at capacity and couldn‚Äôt do anything. When escalated to their guest service ‚Äúsupervisor‚Äù Christopher M. he ignored our concerns and said he would call us back. We never got the call. He was not sympathetic at all was rude and basically accused of us lying about the room condition. He never acknowledged that the room was in poor condition and put the blame on us because ‚Äúwe should have told the front desk multiple times‚Äù. After calling back every single day since our first night there Chris finally answered(4 days later) and said he couldn‚Äôt do much and that the ‚Äúbest‚Äù they could do is give us a 1 comp room for a future date which doesn‚Äôt seem fair. On top of staying in a crappy room don‚Äôt expect complimentary coffee or cups. They don‚Äôt provide any and charge you $14 if you want a cup of coffee. I don‚Äôt know how Caesars Palace ever got a good reputation. You expect high end but pay for Motel 6 quality.
50,lots of quality eating establishments especially the Bacchanal buffet with over 100 stations to partake. Never been disappointed each time I go there. Price are a little steep but well worth it as the cuisine is superb
50,Beautiful stay beautiful view of the Bellagio love the comfy beds loved the service of valet n bell shop I recommend the stay with people with the luxury views n wonderful staff very friendly n upbeat
40,I'd give 5 stars if it wasn't for the smell of smoke in the casino....It's pretty bad. Room was amazing and my wife loved the champagne bath. Caesars is still a great place to go in Vegas even though it is a bit dated. Great Pool.
50,Room was great service was great clean friendly environment was very satisfied pool was clean the pool staff was great cAsino staff bartenders everyone was amazing well presented and was just an amazing over all experience
30,We stayed in the Octavius Tower and it was a long walk to the casino. Plus the table game limits were high during the weekdays and winning on the slots was next to impossible. The room was very nice but no refrigerator.
50,If you have a car to park go to level 3 for easy access in and out. This a ‚Äúsmart parking garage‚Äù.  You are able to locate a vacant space by seeing a green light above the stall.  Don‚Äôt need to hunt for a space.
40,Slot machines were nice!!! Need more machines near the front of the casino....Need to have a smoke free area. Ash trays were full. Miss your moving walkway from the street to the casino........Bathrooms were clean.....
30,The room was very comfortable however I was shocked to find I would have to pay $14.00 to make a cup of coffee in the room. There was a coffee maker but no complimentary coffee sugar/cream. There was a tray with a coffee package that if used would result in $14 being billed to your stay. Also there is a daily resort fee but I don't know what it covered because there was a charge for everything. I asked for a late checkout and was told I could get an hour but anything past that would cost me $60! In the casino a cocktail waitress ignored me and my friend and never brought our drinks that we requested 3 times. We felt discriminated against because we were the only African-Americans in the area and the waitress brought everyone else the drinks they asked for. I spent no lost a large amount of money in the casino and I feel the casino does not have a good selection of slots to choice from. In the past I have always felt like I was someone special and was treated so when I stayed at one of the Caesars Entertainment hotel resorts but not this time. My next visit to Vegas may see me reserving a room at a hotel off the strip or not affiliated with Caesars Entertainment.
40,Caesar‚Äôs Palace was a great place for us to venture into...from the wonderfully clean ladies room to the friendly employees to the good luck that followed me throughout it was an extremely good stop on our rounds!
50,The room size is very decent and not to far from the frontdesk check-in; great selection of restuarants and shopping stores. The room service did a great job to keep our room clean and organize. The only disappontment is the buffet in Paris Casino
50,My wife spent 4 days at this hotel. The service was far better than we have ever experienced. We stayed in the Palace tower. Rooms were clean and large. Beds were very comfortable. Bathroom was large. It had hot tub shower and two sinks.
50,The Hotel was awesome very clean and fresh. The staff was courteous and professional we didn‚Äôt want for anything.  The Restaurants were great and service was super fast.  I will come back again and again.
50,Location quality of rooms staff best shopping at the forum shops and top buffet in Vegas. How can you go wrong. Easy checkin with automated kiosk room was clean large and service was excellent.
50,We stayed at a hotel resort by Holiday Inn. Was nice and the customer service was very good and all were very pleasant. Went to another presentation by wynnham and it was also nice. They too have very nice resort.
50,Hotel very clean and amazing staff.great location great restaurants.Pools are amazing.Very pleasant atmosphere all around..we love staying at Ceasers.we usualy go three times a year.will keep staying at Ceasers.
50,The spa suites are wonderful! No need to leave with everything you could want is here! From the staff to dining and shopping. The choices are excellent. Highly recommended for fun leisure or business. You can do it all! Thank you!
50,Great room in Augustus Tower. The property has really worked to improve itself and it shows. They have put a lot of effort in upgrading their technology. It was easy to text for my room service and the automated check in was great
50,Every visits to Vegas and Caesars has been amazing. I would highly recommend staying and playing in house at Caesars. They are always accommodating and professional. Everyone from the casino resort staff to anyone on property goes out of their way to make you feel welcome.
50,I like it . very nice place and nice people I got a very nice room and very big space  good food court the employees are always have so much patiences to answer all of your questions  good place to stay when you have a family vacations  a lot of table for you to make choice  you no need wait too long even in a weekend Time highly recommend .
50,Clean and well appointed suite with a bathroom filled with luxury so many wonderful choices to eat a pool so large and grand with delightful gardens to walk by on your way to your next destination. Staff who try hard to anticipate your every need and make a point to ask and check in on you. It is a wonderful destination in Las Vegas.
50,Recently stayed at Caesar's for a couple of nights and it was great. Room was comfortable and clean had great service during my stay. I also rarely had to leave since they have everything! Highly recommend.
50,Had a great room fantastic meals a nice afternoon at the pool and won some money too! I‚Äôm never disappointed at Caesar‚Äôs and even took advantage of the on-site Hertz car rental to take a day trip to Death Valley.
50,The Caesars Palace experience is one of luxury. From the well appointed rooms to the fabulous restaurants and night clubs. The sportsbook is the premier betting parlor on the strip with breathtaking large high definition screens surrounding the complex. Great service staff and friendly dealers and bookmakers who are always going the extra mile to make sure that your bets are correct and helpful if you have questions. The Forum shops are always a treat to walk through. Just a great treat overall even for non gamblers!
50,Very lavish and clean hotel. Everything was nice and clean. Customer service was very good. Absolutely great hotel amazing atmosphere amazing ambiance everything about this place is beyond my expectations it's hidden which is a plus for me because you get way more privacy the staff here are also extremely welcoming more than happy to help their guest services does it all.
50,We had not stayed at. Caesars for several years but went back for a conference. We stayed in the tower which had recently been renovated and were impressed with the improvements and quality of amenities. We asked several staff members for directions and recommendations on dining and entertainment and were pleased with the quality of service and their ideas.
50,Excellent service Caesars is beautiful .i recommended it and would return soon.because it covered my expectations. The staff was very attentive the bed very comfortable the bathroom very spacious.It is located in an area in Las Vegas where I can move to places of interest
50,The location is great the restaurants/restaurant selections are great the overall decor/theme is great. Employees were helpful and friendly especially upon check-in. We got a room upgrade and early check-in for using Amex in addition to a $100 credit and a $40 a day credit at Giada's Pronto.
50,We have been going to Vegas for many years and have chosen Caesar's as our go-to place. The entertainment restaurants and service is top rated. Hosts are always available to help with bookings. And the Comps are extraordinary!
50,Great place to stay with lots of things to do. Staff friendly and responsive. Many restaurants and nice casino. I really didn't even need to leave the property as everything I needed was right there. I was attending a meeting there in the convention center and it was really nice to just get on an elevator and go straight to my room after a long day of meetings
50,I live in Riverside CA with in 40 minutes of four Indian casinos SOBOBA -MORONGO- PACHANGA & SAN MANUEL. I go casino-ing average 3 times a monthseems their jackpot ratio seem better than Vagas odds I stay even alot longer- gamble longer with my money.Your slots are to spread-out to much walking.other than that it okay.   but your buffet is the best  THANK YOU
50,I stay here a lot. Never a dull moment located in the middle of everything. My Executive host Laura Nevarez is absolutely wonderful the rooms are spotless and are maintained to the highest standard.. Many fine restaurants. Plenty of store to shop. Journey concert was absolutely fantastic also the Paris 20th Anniversary Party was a great time
40,Great looking casino. Plenty to do. Went in to their merchandise store they have Journey Guns and Roses Mariah Carey some Celine Dion and soon to have Sting. Got me Journey DvD. Very classy Casino.
50,Stayed here for my birthday for 5 nights. We were fortunate to be upgraded as our room wasn‚Äôt ready and this room was beyond all expectations! It‚Äôs was absolutely huge and had a jacuzzi in it! The views were also amazing!    The scale of this resort is incredible! You can walk for hour around it and it has everyone. From world class restaurants to designer shops and a night club.    The service form the staff was great although the hotel was always so busy so be prepared to queue.    Great location to visit most places and we walked to most.    The pool area is lovely plenty of comfy sun beds however a couple of the pools were shut for events which was disappointing!    The casino is endless although not the cheapest minimum bets. The cheapest table we could find was $15 minimum bet.    We would definitely stay here again.
50,Been to Vegas twice before I had to try Ceasers for my last and from the start it turned out great. Check was busy but its the time of day we arrived but the receptionist was fantastic and so much fun with my sense of humor. My room wasn't ready but gave me a twin but wow the view was fantastic and just a perfect room in the end to make it even better the experience. The staff very friendly and helpful especially on Bus routes etc. Didn't ask for room to be done on Reception when asked but they cleaned it which was amazing (I gave the voucher back) I am honest. The hotel was great to explore and even though I don't gamble it's a wonderful experience to have in this hotel. Well done and thanks for the memories.
50,"We have visited a large variety of Casinos everywhere! We are from Northern Calif. & recently visited a few casinos in 3 different states. Oklahoma Texas & New Mexico. Caesars Palace has it dialed in. From the hotel rooms to the massive layout of the casino floor the Shops to the incredible Buffet they have - This is one of my personal favorite casinos to stay & play at. It has hands down the BEST Buffet we have ever eaten at in all the casinos we have visited. It is not your standard ""run of the mill"" casino buffet. We usually steer clear of casino buffets as most are just blah ( personal opinion ). We have stayed at close to all of the casinos up and down the Vegas strip - just so we could experience them. Caesars Palace is the only place we will stay aside from our timeshare."
50,Whew the Caesars‚Äô Palace is HUGE! My goodness! I was so overwhelmed looking at it. We went through the shopping area and it was so beautiful. I love the sky style ceiling and the luxury feel. We met a really nice security guard and I wish I knew her name but she was super cool to talk to.
50,I had a wonderful stay at Caesar‚Äôs Palace Augustus Tower. This tower is opulent and elegant with very nice rooms and large bathrooms. The tower is quiet and just far enough away from the noise of the casino yet close to the center of the resort.    I would recommend reserving an Augustus Tower hotel room with a view of the Bellagio Fountains. It‚Äôs spectacular!
50,and also tv is always manipulate employees to follow me which slot machinesI'm playing  Also TV in the room always hack they want to listen to our conversation That is  invading privacy. Next time I come back please make sure that it is not happening again Privacy is important
30,The accommodations are fine but there are a few curious extra fees that seemed out of the ordinary to me. We tried to check into the hotel around noon and were told checkin is not until 4. Since there are 4 thousand rooms I asked whether there were any available for early checkin. I was told there were but I would have to pay a $40 early checkin fee. I paid the fee. I was also told there is a $40 daily resort fee that entitles us to unlimited use of the gym and in room WiFi. I wasn‚Äôt going to use the gym but of course would utilize WiFi which I thought was free. By the way the resort fee only covers two devices and each additional device incurs a $14 daily fee. The topper for me was the in room coffee. Like most hotels a single cup coffee maker is in the room. Instructions on how to use the coffee maker are on a card next to the machine which also informs you where the K-cups are since they are not located next to the coffee maker. I found the coffee and made a couple of cups during our stay. In reviewing my bill at checkout I noticed a $15 dollar room service fee. Since I didn‚Äôt use room service I questioned the charge. I was told the charge was for the coffee. I‚Äôve stayed at numerous hotels both domestic and international and this charge for the coffee was a first for me. For what is supposed to be a first class operation it seemed a bit cheap to me. Be aware the room rates may seem reasonable but the add on fees put the rates in a different light.
50,Lupe a room cleaner on floor 23 is truely amazing. Does a great job always pleasant and friendly.    Michelle at the VIP checkin in also great!!! Extremely competent helpful and very friendly!!!    They make my trip much more enjoyable and are reason for me to return to Caesars
50,Had a chance to visit Caesar's Las Vegas and found the casino to be well laid out and the Sportsbook easily accessible and the Sportsbook video poker bar was conveniently located to watch games. Next trip I plan on staying at Caesars.
50,Had the amazing strip view room for our stay. The grounds are perfect the rooms are beautiful and the bathrooms were just as big as the room. We loved it. Everything is nearby and the mall has great little food spots.
10,this trip we took sept.27th 2019 as a group was my first trip on a airplane and anywere really that wasnt in my hometown. we ge there and check in and get the info we need along with the lady at the cunter saying we can come back at one and they usually will have the room ready even though the rooms set time was 4 to 6 for getting in. well we drop our stuff off with the bell services and leave for a while and came back around 4 and waited in a horrible long line just to see if we can get in our room yet and it was not ready. the man at the counter told us to try again in a bit and also said they will send a text if sooner. and they they guarentee the rooms are ready by 6. so we waited.... 5:40 came along and we waited AGAIN in this long line and we get to the counter and it was 6:04 and our room was STILL not ready! and at this point we are sooo tired from the early flight and being on our feet and long lines and so i told the man can you please get us in anywere at this point even if its not on the floor we wanted with our group. he got quiet and did abunch of tying not saying anything to us and walked away into the back and so we waited for a few moments he comes back and says nothing to us as we wait quietly. I said to him look you guarenteed us by 6 and its past 6 and now i haft to ask for another room this is rediculous. and he said one moment please im gonna try to figure out something. then we stand there and he writes stuff down and tells us your all set! we grab it upset and go up to our floor and it ended up being 630 before we even got in. the room was not even close to being nice. it was like we were staying in a cheap hotel. and then come to find out our group that was with us couldnt get in there room so we were there waiting in our room and then finally got in at 730!!!! making us miss our plans. then later on we went to get ice and the i ce machine was not working on our floor so i texted ivy the hotel service and let them know we were needing some and that it was broken on our floor and they just said to go to another floor and get it instead of being good costomer service and bringing us some. THAN the next day we were so excited to hear they had pools! we get down there and all of the areas were shut down but one little small area! it would of ben so nice but we couldnt even get in. the bathrooms were dirty by the poo area sinks were shut down water fountain was nasty looking we were so disapointed! the whole stay was just not good. pretty bummed about us picking this hotel. especially for my first trip.
50,I go to Las Vegas yearly but never stayed along the strip until this October. Great accommodation with  really nice view of the strip. All the staff in Cesars Palace are extremely nice and helpful. It was a great  experience.
50,Caesars Palace is beautiful. It is perfectly located on the Vegas strip and in walking distance from tons of entertainment. We ate at several of the different restaurants inside the hotel and the food was fantastic! My only complaint is that the casino was very smoky. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
50,So much to do and the crowd was so fun! The venue was amazing! Consents clubs music restaurants it has it all!! Gaming choices were updated and fresh! I will definitely be back to visit Caesars this year!
10,Do not go to this hotel!  I stayed here for 5 nights during a conference. Not once was the room cleaned during my entire stay although I had NOT opted out of room service. When I complained the reception manager Aisha Jaggers was arrogant and unapologetic. She simply claimed I had opted out of room service thereby implying that I was lying.  Also the hotel charges a ‚Äúresort fee‚Äù in addition to the (already exorbitant) room fee allegedly for the use of the pool the gym and the Wi-fi. They do not mention this either at reservation or at check in and it is not possible to opt out of this. Essentially you think you‚Äôre paying a certain amount for the room but the hotel will charge you 15-20% more (+ tax of course) without telling you. In my book that is theft pure and simple.  For all this money you‚Äôd think you‚Äôd be getting a good Wi-fi coverage but the internet connection is very slow and you need to re-connect your device every time you want to use an internet connection. In Guatemala I would understand not in Las Vegas!  As if this was not enough already the hotel will also randomly charge you minibar fees on a daily basis even if you have not touched the minibar. Clearly they are just trying their luck and hoping that clients will just pay without checking the invoice. Just another proof of the dishonesty bordering on criminality of the staff and management running this so-called ‚Äúhotel‚Äù. I would call it a criminal organisation rather than a hotel.  If you don‚Äôt want to get ripped off don‚Äôt go simple as that!
10,They totally screwed my reservation. I was sold on a suite with a 2 queen connector. When I arrived and checked in we were sold a 1 queen connector. It‚Äôs unfair they would charge so much money $2010 to be exact only to give me what is available and not what I paid for. I was given a virtual tour of what I was paying for and promised!
30,Our initial impression was positive and Kristen Smith was very helpful at check in. In fact staff friendliness was the highlight of our stay.    Rooms are nicely appointed with high quality materials and they are clean with decent linens but they are modern and not consistent with the romantic and warm roman theme. We upgraded our room but it looked standard to us as was the parking lot view. Don‚Äôt bother.    So for what you pay you expect what? Bathrobes? Nope. Coffeemaker? Yes but no coffee. Bring your own K cups because if you think a coffee kit is obviously included somewhere and pick it up to read you are immediately charged. Open the refrigerator to put in the apple you brought you are immediately charged. Get the idea? I HATE being nickel and dimed at a price point like this. If they had signs warning you at least you‚Äôd know before finding it appear in the bill. Oh and if you shut off the entry light it kills the power to the bed side plug so you‚Äôll find out in the AM that you phone did not charge.    And then there is the $45 a night resort fee. For this you get internet for only two devices and pool towels because despite the truly magnificent pool area the main pool was closed and there was zero pool side service unless you rented a day bed or cabana. The pool side snack bar was also closed. You had to fight at the one bar to get a drink (they ran out of Grey Goose) and no food. WTF. What a rip off. Plus the pool is not smoke free.
20,We went out there with my wife who was at a conference so my two children and I went out for vacation very unhelpful staff when it came to registering for the room gave us the wrong room then made us wait a half an hour before giving us the correct room not to mention a security jack at 8 o‚Äôclock at night while trying to put my children to bed where the housekeeper knocked And within 30 seconds open the door unannounced scaring both my children when I spoke to the manager about this he seemed very non-concerned with it very unprofessional Next time in Vegas we will be staying at a different hotel bad experience all around not to mention we were never told about the housekeeping charge and since we didn‚Äôt know about it they canceled the housekeeping without letting us now so nothing got changed new no new towels or anything even when I asked
20,Celebrating my husband‚Äôs 50th birthday. We made our reservation months ago requesting a high floor with strip view to celebrate this very special birthday occasion. Upon checking in from flying all day from Florida. We were given a very low floor. When I asked about this I was instructed to get back into another very long line to talk to a Manager. They told me that they were completely sold out for the night and they would call me tomorrow if something came available. They never called me back. We were stuck listening to loud traffic every night and I could not sleep. Horrible customer service experience!!! No one cared!!!
50,Large stylish rooms with sectional couch and a perfect bathroom that includes huge soaker tub made for 2 as well as a 2 person shower and a separate toilet room plus an additional bathroom and sink! If you're looking for a more sophisticated stay and want to be treated like a VIP then Caesars Palace is definitely the place for you! The pools are the best and the restaurant options are amazing.
30,1. Be prepared for a long long queue at check in. I have no idea why but check in takes ages. Don't approach the desk until invited to do so or they might take longer and ten shuffle their papers etc ! To be fair he did rescue his initial default position with an upgrade but when you are tired after a long flight I like to be welcomed even if it isn't genuine.  2. The resort fee is something you probably won't consider when costing out your visit. It isn't cheap !  3. Rooms are ok but they penalise you for daring to use the fridge for anything non Caesars related and the coffee pods are outrageously priced. Pop over the road and get them from CVS.  4. Speed of service - I thought American service is supposed to be better than everywhere else but it is tediously slow. Just getting a coffee takes an eternity. I love that the class system is supposedly absent in America just replaced by various memberships so you can use a different queue ! I'd love to know what the French and Italians make of these long queues when they don't tolerate them at home !  5. We visited for a conference. Not the best venue by a long long long way. Poor audio visual services. Old system perhaps and very small screens. No additional monitors. Poor food - they ran out of a lot of stuff !  All said we had a great time - that unique Las Vegas style ! Maybe none of the other hotels are any better but Caesar got stabbed to death and the Roman Republic fell into ruins. So .... managers beware !!  Would I stay here again ? Really not too sure. I think there are many better options now.
50,I love the Caesars Palace it is located in the middle of the Las Vegas strip the Bacchanal Buffet is the best in Las Vegas i give it 5 Stars  the Casino is good and The Forum shops are great as well !!
50,The rooms are fabulous. The location is perfect - Center Strip. All major hotel casinos are less than a 10 to 15 minute walk or so. The staff is super friendly and very helpful. I have never had a bad experience of any kind at Caesars. They really get customer service. Strongly recommended!
40,Rooms were great-- recently remodeled . Love the Starbucks inside Caesars. The food at Giada's is excellent. The price is high but the settingservice and taste are well worth it. The drinks are amazing. I highly recommend.
50,This casino has to be on everyones bucket list. Excellent location in the middle of the strip and great customer service. The buffet is a little more than the rest but well worth the cost. Strongly recommend this hotel!
50,Good vibes and pleasant times.  I love the flamingo hotel because you pay very reasonable prices for staying in the middle of the strip close and walking distance to any other resort or restaurant that you want to get to. The staff at the flamingo are very well trained and the reason I say that is because every employee that I encountered greeted me with a smile and gave me good vibes all throughout my stay. I have the gold room which was amazing. I will definitely return to the flamingo hotel soon there‚Äôs no other hotel that I can stay on the strip that is clean has great employees call mom and walking distance to everything that I want can‚Äôt get anything better for that price.
50,Was truly a great experience. Was great to get away and enjoy the peacefulness of Vegas without all the kids. Highly recommend Caesars Palace as a mature Vegas experience. See a show enjoy the shops gamble and eat at any of the delicious restaurants.
50,Amazing room view...paris on the left bellagio to the right.    Sears sucker restaurant was delish.    The bars/lounges provides awesome entertainment.    Don‚Äôt forget to watch the shows...i saw journey and it was an awesome treat.
40,Room was good....had a junior suite. Could use a little updating. Casino floor is crowded though many different types of games to experience. Food is good in the American Cafe and Nobu was exceptional.
50,Just wanted to mention the help I received from a member of the Total Rewards department. Had some issues recently and was helped by the Caesars Rewards manager Stephanie Brown. She is someone who went out of her way to help me get things resolved & showed true professionalism and dedication to her job.
30,Just wanted to tell you of my recent experience at the check in desk at Caesars Palace. I was taken care of by a gentleman named Xavier Macias who I also had the pleasure of meeting previously.An issue arose where the room that two people reserved for me was not only not ready(after I just had a 5 hour flight) but as it turns out I was never getting anyway. Xavier went to work and corrected that and turned what was a nightmare into complete satisfaction for me. It was absolutely amazing that ‚Äú2‚Äù other people couldn‚Äôt accomplish this and only Xavier had the understanding of not only knowing how to resolve the situation but also had enough pride & caring in his job. A star has been born at Caesars and his name is Xavier.
40,Caesars is centrally located on the strip. If you want to visit other hotels/casinos it‚Äôs a doable walk to Belligio or Bally‚Äôs to pick up monorails. We found Caesars to be expensive for food. We went with a group of seniors and just don‚Äôt eat the volume to make buffets sensible. We ventured toward Planet Hollywood and had breakfast two days at Cabo Wabo.  Another day took a taxi to Fremont Street. Expect to see near nudity on the street. Can recommend Magnolias at Four Queens. Tables have lower limits here.  Visited the newer ‚ÄúD‚Äù casino  enjoyed that also.    Check out happy hours. Works nicely for drinks and appetizers.
30,Lovely comfortable rooms  But;  Poorly signed and difficult to find your way around when you arrive  Ridiculously expensive food - no quick cheap meals here at all  Cigarettes smoking everywhere  Car park to rooms about 1 kilometre walking  Very difficult to get a porter to take luggage to your car we waited over an hour then carried out bags to the car - about a kilometre  We were there for a conference and unlikely ever to return
40,Room was 5 star very clean Customer is awsome . I was treated first class the entire trip. Food was awsome Gaming staff did a wonderful job keeping me inform and teaching me new games that i have not played in years.
40,This is a great place on the strip if you are looking for a spa and pool and nice hotel rooms. Service is always top notch and the room is very comfortable. this is my go to spot to stay when I'm vegas.
30,"Made our reservation online thinking we did OK. Get there and they tack on an automatic $44 ""resort fee"". Stick it. What a joke. It's a hotel room a nice big hotel room but a hotel room and a casino. Welcome to Vegas every casino hotel is a hotel room and a casino. Horrible. I hate these new trumped-up tack-on charges. You'll pay for parking too. Never again. I'll do better next time."
40,You cannot beat the location of Caesars Palace on the strip! It is close proximity to all the main attractions on the strip. Add in the attached Forum shops for shopping and the seven pools (where you can get sunshine any time of the day) and you just can't beat it. The service was great - the staff were courteous and helpful both at check in and check out. We had a room in the Forum Tower and it was quiet clean and tastefully decorated.
50,Caesars Palace is still the premier property in Las Vegas. My first visit was in 1981 and I still prefer to go there even after stays at numerous other hotels. Friendly staff like Mehret at the front desk and the great service all around gives this hotel the reputation it truly deserves. Plenty of restaurants events and things to do. Not just a gambling hotel. Truly an experience to be had.
50,We had a nice view from the Augustus Tower. I understand if you have an even number room you get a view of the Bellagio's fountain so keep that in mind when cheecking in. We tried several buffets using the 24 hour buffet pass and it was totally worth it. Caesar's had the best buffet including awesome dim sum that rivals Chinatown in NYC. The quality of food was excellent and service throughout was great down to the friendly janitor in the check-in lobby.
50,ExcellentTime! My Wife's Birthday Trip! Had a Fabulous time at Caesar's!  Journey Concert was Wonderful! Staff was Wonderful & Helpful!  Looking forward to our next Caesar's & Vegas Experience!  All Caesar's resorts we visited on our trip were very friendly!
50,When we arrived at valet Billy made our night: He was personable and efficient; but more importantly he recommended Mesa Grill for dinner and Absinthe as the best show in Vegas. And boy was he right on the money. The food and service at Mesa Grill were spot on and the show was loaded with talented acts and over-the-top humor. We arrived with no real plan and Billy showed interest enough to make it a fun evening. Never had a valet guy so personable and greet us with a smile.
50,We visited Atlantic City for the Atlantic City Half Marathon and went to Bally‚Äôs Casino to pick up my race number and shirt. We decided to have dinner at Guy Fieri‚Äôs Chophouse. Trixie was our server - she was fun and efficient! Her recommendation for the BBQ Mushroom Burger was on the spot. It was an excellent burger that I couldn‚Äôt put down. She also recommended the blueberry crumble dessert with blueberry ice cream and blueberry sorbet...it came in a big fishbowl glass and was delicious and refreshing! Trixie also brought a special vanilla ice cream dessert just for our daughter. Great experience and we would love to come back and try more burgers and dessert again!
50,Great level of service. Friendly personnel. Really enjoyed spa and massage. Quick check in. Everyone available to assist when you need directions. Highly recommend for anyone to visit. Very clean and I really enjoyed Hells Kitchen
50,Everything about this hotel is beautiful. The rooms are very well appointed and comfortable and the grounds are STUNNING! There are so many restaurant choices right on the property and within walking distance. This hotel puts you right in the middle of the action on the strip. I'd book there again and recommend it to friends.
20,I've stayed at Ceasar's many times but this time was a pain! Room service wouldn't work (through the tv!) I was asked at check in if I needed maid service EVERYDAY and I said no. I caught the maid in the hall on day 3 and requested my room to be cleaned she said ok...never happened. Called the front dest several times and always got a busy signal. Steam room in spa was out on first day. Allergic to the pillows ordered hypo-allergenic they were so tall they were unusable. Not the same hotel...avoid!
50,It took us almost half hour to find a way to our room :) Anyway the room was amazing: huge shiny and perfectly equipped. Ceasars has so many places so you can spend a week in it and never go outside.
10,I am more than disappointed of the front desk from cesars palace! We are planning for years to come to vegas and our first choice was the famous ceasars palace but in fact it is nothing just expensive for nothing. A total ripp off system! We paid more than 1.300 dollar for an standard room. Ok no problem. But they charged everything extra what is in every other CHEAPER and better hotel of course! the worst thing ever was charging 7500 dollars from us because we put a bottle of OUR water in the minibar! becaus the minibar is not for our privat use WHAT? It is in our room and sorry but I dont need the fiji water. so they force you to buy their super expensive drinks and when you open the munibar to cool a bottle of coke you brought wirh you for 15 min you pay 75 dollars - even if you pay a horense amount for the room consume every day in their reastaurants give tip aso ...  Our travel was 19 days and we were all over the westcoast in beautifull hotels and always had a good experiances but the cesars palace is nothing as a soapbubble! I am not stingy but so angry about that! friends of us planned to stay in cesars in march I will recommend them NOT to do that. there are so many hotels in vegas stress-free! was a charming gooodbye
40,This is a hotel to recommend. Huge rooms with good beds and great bathrooms. The location is excellent just across the street from Bellagio Paris and Flamingo. The self check in process was not good but we received the help we needed. We received a text when we arrived so we could text to a number if we had any questions. We did that several times and it worked very well. Caesars Palace is a good place to stay. Very typical Vegas-experience with huge and not very personal hotels. The pool-area is nice though all the hot-tubs seemed close for the season.
50,Augustus tower has bellagio fountain views ... amazing big rooms Kid friendly ...  great restaurants .. perfect location and accessibility to Las Vegas strip..! Concierge was helpful  Maintained Quality
50,It began with Anselmo at the front desk going the extra mile to help me because he knew i had been traveling all day and was tired. He was wonderful. All other staff were also excellent and suite was beautiful. thank you for a special experience.
50,Everything was 5+ Stars...throughout! I have stayed at Caesar‚Äôs Palace many times. I have to say they are better every time I stay. But on this visit I experienced even a finer level of customer service fine dining and helpful staff. Cheers Caesar‚Äôs!
50,Great trip  Service was great and enjoyed the casino. Workers went out of their way to help. Room was great and well maintained. Look forward to our next trip. The dealers were very friendly and enjoyable to speak with.
50,From the moment i registered till the time i left they made me feel special. The had the answers I needed and were very helpful. I cannot wait to go back. The food and service in the Restraunts were excellent
50,we couldn't of asked for better! I reserved a room in the Augusta tower with a strip room. Mehret was was nice at check in she upgraded us to a jr suite so we had a corner room with views of the strip mountains and pools! Heck our room even had a doorbell and 2 a/c temp setting controls! Everything was clean and very beautiful. I get people are aggravated at the mini bar and frig charge.. we didn't use either. We enjoy coffee in the morning while getting ready so I brought my own pods... coffee in the mini bar was $14.00 for 2 k-cups! The hotel itself was beautiful the older parts I do agree smelled like someone vomited but we didn't have a reason to be in that area lol! The pools were beautiful the restaurants and shops were plentiful with lots to choose from. We ate breakfast in cafe americano a couple of mornings and it was so delicious... service sucked one of those mornings but nothing to stop my good time! We also ate at Beijing Raos and Hell‚Äôs Kitchen. All were top notch. I'd definitely stay here again
50,First off once you arrive they make you feel like royalty . Any needs or wants were met ASAP. Didn‚Äôt go more then 10 minutes without someone asking if everything was going well. Next time trip I make to Vegas I‚Äôll definitely be spending most or all my time at Ceasars!!
40,Room was updated. Food option were convenient and varied. Poker room had very good action. I spent a lot of time at the Cromwell next door. They had a single zero roulette wheel with the lowest minimum bets in all of Las Vegas.
50,We had an amazing time. Casino is very clean and staff is very friendly and helpful. Casino has a great layout which makes it easier to locate restaurants etc. This was our first visit to Vegas we will definitely be back again. Beautiful weather to enjoy touring around.
50,A huge resort casinos restuarants shops. Fantastic rooms! Two days and never left the grounds. A truely great flagship of Caesars! Ate well too well. Saw great concert. Had wonderful time in wonderful place thats why they call it The Palace.
50,I had a fantastic time with my girlfriends. We planned a trip to see journey at Caesars and rocked out all weekend. The food was delicious and DJ at the bar kept us dancing all night. We're will definitely do it again soon.
20,I hate giving a bad review but there‚Äôs other hotels on the strip that have special qualities that make you feel relaxed when you enter your room or the tower your room is in. At ceasars there‚Äôs no calming scent or music that fills the air as you get on the elevator the lobby is like grand central station the rooms are old clean but old with no real design message. The hotel is extremely expensive drinks by the pool 26.00. We‚Äôve had wonderful stays at the Delano (attached to Mandaly Bay) with their modern desert themed rooms and Pallazo;(attached to the Venetian) old Vegas glamour both gorgeous properties. Ceasars is unfriendly and commercially old fashioned.
40,Caesars Palace's room was amazing and so clean. The employees were all so kind and funny. They would say that my dog is cute and they would ask if we needed help with our luggage. Over all I think that Caesars Palace is a great place and I would recommend this place to anyone interested.
40,"Stayed in the Augustus Tower standard room.  Location - LOVE the location both of Caesars generally and in particular for the Augustus Tower. Very near the lobby don't need to trek miles through the casino to get out to the middle of The Strip.  Room - The room was fantastic - huge very well laid out full sitting area comfy bed huge bathroom big soaker tub. Minor issues with the room were that the towel hook by the shower kept falling off the bath mat was teensy tiny and the floor very slippy when wet and the jets in the tub didn't work.  Pool - Our primary issues with Caesars related to the pool. We went at the beginning of October and half of the pools were closed so the pools that were open were packed. It was impossible to get any chairs (clearly planned so that you have to pay for a cabana or daybed.). The daybeds were extremely comfortable though so potentially worth the price. The biggest issue by the pools though is the service. Drink service was spotty at best one afternoon we sat there for 3 hours asked waitress a few times for a drink and were never served. But food service was absolutely ridiculous. There's no food service ""off season"". Instead you have to text a number (the number itself is buried and hard to find). But you can't actually text that number if you're out of state visitors (at a hotel for visitors from all over the world). Once you managed to get through to this mystical text number it then texts you back a menu you can order. Like Uber Eats for your pool chair except food arrives cold and they make it almost impossible to order.  - Only other comment is that the Wifi is spotty (if I'm being generous).  Cafe Americane and the buffet were both yummy."
50,Great casino and very good restaurants. Very nice hotel and one of the best on the strip. A little smokey but that is to be expected. Poker room was very good and tournaments were well attended. Would return.
20,We arrived Thursday night to an un vacuumed room with a dirty tub and a badly stained couch. Problems were brought up to management and they were unwilling and uncooperative to do anything about the situation. FYI.. most of us folk just want a clean room and we don‚Äôt like to spend our time going back and forth trying to get that.
50,Augustus Towers....AWESOME. View down South of strip fabulous! Room very spacious and spotless. Took in a concert FANTASTIC! Mr. Chow's was well beyond our expectations and the customer service there...‚Ä¶..One of the Best Experiences of the weekend
50,We had a great stay! There was so much to do it was overwhelming but the hotel staff was so friendly it didn‚Äôt seem so intimidating after awhile. A special shoutout to Kristen Smith at reservations who took her time and bent over backwards to help us with an issue. I highly recommend the hotel and the food. We like to eat heathy and that wasn‚Äôt a problem however if you don‚Äôt want a lot of veggies you‚Äôll be happy tooüòä
40,"I enjoy staying in the Palace Premium Studio rooms. The are large and have 2 bathrooms which is great when travelling with 2 or more women. The rooms are quite a way from the main casino and front door but the size and bathrooms are worth the walk as the rooms are very close to the pool. Beds were comfortable but the sheets were a little ""pilly"" I bring ""travel jewelry"" with me and when I take it off put it in a cup on the desk or counter. I believe the maid mistakenly tossed my glass containing a couple pairs of earrings and a watch. not a big deal but would suggest putting anything of value into the safe. (I should have known better).  Overall Caesars location is great right in the middle of the strip. Bacchanal Buffet is amazing! Love Caesars pool. We got there just as winter hours were starting so the Temple pool was closed but we enjoyed a cabana for a day at the Neptune pool. Still nice and sunny even though it was a bit cool for a swim. The blackjack pool was very warm though if you wanted to take a dip.  A couple minor things to complain about in my room. My sink plunger had to be turned to let the water go down the sink the closet door with the mirror wouldn't shut completely. Just blocked the hallway a bit. The engineer did come up and fix the shower hookup from the wall as it spayed out of one of the jack and jill shower doors. As I was packing to leave in the morning (at 2 am) the last thing I had to do was get my stuff out of the safe. It wouldn't open and kept saying ""error"". The locksmith did come up early and had it open in a jiffy as I had to leave by 8am. Turned out not to be a problem.  Overall we had a great stay!"
20,Robot check-in worked well. Directions from robot check-in were undecipherable and poor grammar. Room was last decorated in the 80's. Seems they're trying for large numbers with no service. They're getting there. Very impersonal hotel experience.
50,Lots of friendly dealers and a huge variety of slot machines to choose from. Lots of different food options that stay open late. Nice rooms with great views. I don't like the fact that there isn't a host on call 24/7
40,We came to caesar‚Äôs to gamble i have not seen machines that i like- sun and moon tiki torch buffalos are very limitedi lost a lot of money in your casino. No one came to offer any drinks and when my machine malfunctioned i pushed help button but no ones coming for a long time and so i asked the orderly thats cleaning the sorrounding to call for someone and then someone came. The cashier is soooo far away from the casino. You have very few atm machines coz when i withdraw money i been going around to look for one. Its been a while since i visited caesar‚Äôs palace. Your hotel is cery nice especially the pool the attraction zeus drama is cery cool! The shopping is aweaome i just didnt have fund to shop anymore as i lost everything in the casino. I lost all cash i even have to wothdraw couple of times. :(
50,Caesers never disappoints. The addition of the Vanderpump Cocktail Garden is an amazing addition. I only wish Omnia wasn‚Äôt soo incredibly crowded but other than that it is an amazing experience all around
50,The room was clean big and had a great view. Service was excellent every employee we encountered was friendly and helpful. There are many food choices in the hotel. I loved the location on the strip so it had easy access to other casinos.
50,My wife and I have been going to Vegas for over 40 years and have stayed and played at several different Hotel Casinos. We have been staying at Ceasars for the last 20 plus years because of the fine service excellent housekeeping (very important to my wife) fine food usually do well at the blackjack tablesand like the sports book viewing area.We have never had a bad experiencealway's a great time !!!
10,We were at Caesars for our honeymoon. When we got there expecting at least a little upgrade we got DOWNGRADED from the king suite we booked to a queen size bed because they had overbooked the king rooms.  The outlets in the room were not convenient and we had to unplug lights to charge our phones. The one outlet in the bathroom didn't work AT ALL so I had to do my hair sitting in front of the hallway mirror.  I had high expectations for room service but was very disappointed when 4 crappy chicken tenders and a dry cookie costs us $60.  I travel fairly often for work and of the many hotels I've stayed in this was by far the most disappointing given our expectations. The Marriott hotels I've stayed in are far nicer more comfortable more tailored to the guests experience and far better value! We won't be back.
50,I have stayed at almost all of the hotels on the strip. I was hooked once I tried Caesars (about 5 years ago) and now I won't stay anywhere else.    The service is amazing in this hotel. Treat the staff well. They deserve it. Give them the respect they deserve and they will take care of you.    The location is the best on the strip. Caesars has everything you need...the Colosseum Nobu GR Pub Hell's Kitchen plus more restaurants that are out of this world shopping at the Forum Shops and choice of rooms and towers - I believe there are six towers. I usually stay in the Nobu tower but this trip I stayed in Augustus. The Augustus rooms are huge. We had a strip view room. I think most of their rooms either face the Bellagio Fountains the strip or the pools - all beautiful views.    Caesars is very safe compared to other hotels (I think). I come solo often and never worry being in Caesars on my own. The Casino staff are amazing and they always remember me. They are friendly and courteous. I especially love Yolanda the cocktail server in the Casino.    Highly recommend!!
50,I visit Vegas often and Caesar's never disappoints. The staff is really friendly and make you feel valued/welcome! It's nice when staff members recognize me from previous trips and take a moment to see how I'm doing etc.
10,My room had a view of electrical conduit piping and a concrete wall. If that‚Äôs your idea of a good time in Vegas then ask for Rm 387 Julius Tower. There is no fridge to store cold drinks. You have to walk thru a smoky casino area of course to get to elevator to this room. There is nothing sweet about this suite.
50,Dealers are always so friendly and helpful.    Caesars is always so clean and I feel safe there.    Food selection is awesome Mr Chow is spectacular. Raos food is so good.    KJ at the pool is the best.    Rooms are spacious and very nice.
50,Great experience. The place was pumping with fun and eye candy. Caesars has it all. Great room great entertainment great food and endless fun at the bars. I just wish they had more texas holdem tables.
50,We joined up with family by recommendation for our first experience with Caesars properties. Our room was overlooking Caesars Mirage and Bellagio properties on the main strip. There were many food options for the light eater like my wife and for the heavy eater like myself. Im a table player and felt welcomed and genuinely enjoyed winning and donating money to and from the house. We used Valet baggage holds wheelchair accesses players cards pool access gym in the morning and drinks 24-7. We had ages from 33 to 66 all in the same party with memories for everyone with a smile.
50,Our room was very clean and the food was excellent every employee was very helpful and knowledgeable. I had never stayed at Ceasar's before. It is now my favorite place to stay. It is centrally located so I can walk to different casinos.
30,Hotel was nice clean and staff were very friendly. Tables Restaurants and entertainment was on the high end of expensive for the value! No hot tub either. Plus the pools are a very far walk to get to! Not convenient at all
50,My birthday celebration was simply fabulous can hardly wait till next year to come so I could do it again . If you want to have a good time not only to celebrate your birthday anniversary or someone you love just because I recommend Caesar‚Äôs Palace you will not be disappointed I know I wasn‚Äôt
50,I would recommend Caesar's Palace to anyone that is thinking of traveling to Las Vegas. Everything you need for a long weekend is in one place restaurants shows gambling. Let Caesar's Palace treat you in style!
50,Best place on the strip great pool and casino great staff and restaurants tenth visit there will return again. Location and staff are the best on the strip. I always would recomend this reort to any friends or family.
50,The casino was very clean and the waitresses were very helpful and checked on us often . The dealers at the roulette table were very friendly and helpful.this casino is was definitely the most comfortable to me the safe was amazing and everyone was so friendly. Good vibes.
50,Great experience at ceasars. Thank you. I wish drinks would come quicker while gambling but I completely understand the delay as your casino is always very busy. I would also love to have more comps as M life gives me free rooms. That is why I no longer stay at ceasars and just visit
40,Our room which was a suite in the Augustus tower was very nice and clean and we had a great view of the strip. It did have a keurig coffee maker in the room but if you want coffee it is not free. They have it on the mini bar for 14$. I actually brought my own pods sweetner and creamer though. Also the only fridge in the room is the mini bar and if you touch anything it will automatically charge your room. The bed is super soft which I liked but some people do not. It does have a great gym.
50,As usual I enjoyed the amenities and service at this property. Very attentive and friendly. Always enjoy my visits there. The room was comfortable and clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. The restaurants weren't too crowded and the meals were great.
40,very clean people are very nice Thank you fo ra great time. I really enjoy my stay. Just that when arraving to hotel it would be nice to offer a good spa. The food was gooooddddd. I won as well lol...one of the best part.
50,Had a great overall experience.. Employees were pleasant and informative.. Rooms were large and Clean.. Great Restaurants and Bars... Pools were awesome... Casino was large but easy to get around .. Resort had great signs to get you were your going..
50,Excellent service!! Centrally located on the Las vegas Strip which is convenient for any visitor. Fantastic restaurants and great enterntanment!! The service was impeccable and the staff was friendly and curteous. This will be the only place we will ever stay when visiting Vegas.
40,Place is very nice shows are amazingthe buffet had a lot of choices of cousine something for everyone in my groupprices are a little $$$$ but very well lworth.ibwill recomende to all my family and friends
50,"What can you say? The place is so iconic and just the embodiment of Las Vegas.    This was my third time staying here so I guess its safe to say I LOVE the place.    I stayed in the Augustus Tower this time as opposed to the Palace Tower. I think I preferred the location of the Augustus Tower as it is in close proximity to Las Vegas Blvd as opposed to the Palace Tower which is down the other end closer to the pool - have to walk for miles to get out of the hotel to get out - yes it really is that big.    The Augustus Tower rooms are all newly renovated and have views over the strip. The bathroom alone is bigger than my bedroom at home. They have walk in showers Jacuzzi and a double vanity. The toilet is separate.    The actual room was more akin to a junior suite huge very comfortable bed with a table and lounge setting.    The only thing I hate about the rooms is the motion sensor mini bar. Charging $75 to use the fridge is also a bit cheeky especially when a bottle of water is $8 plus tax! It's also not helpful when your father (in the next room) has memory problems and no matter how many times you tell him - ""Don't touch the mini-bar"" immediately forgets and moves everything around. Luckily the staff on check out were very understanding and removed everything from my parents bill.    The pool area is divine but for some reason the circular pool is FREEZING cold while the other pool is heated. This caused most people to swim in the heated pool which meant it was totally overcrowded. The drinks at the pool are also drastically over priced. I didn't actually order any and just enjoyed the magnificent pool area for this reason.    There are many on site dining options the buffet is the most famous in Vegas. Service is not the greatest considering the cost but the food it wonderful.    Trying to sort anything out is a bit of a fiasco - there are only 2 concierge desks meaning you have to line up for quite a while to ask even the simplest of questions. Forget calling from your room - then you wait on hold forever. I don't know why such a huge hotel has only 2 people at the concierge? Makes no sense.    Despite my small qualms I'm still giving it 5 stars - Caesar's Palace - I will be back!"
50,Great location. Beautiful property. Lots to do eat and shop. Great Friendly and professional service. The buffet will not disappoint! Love the food at nobu too. Convenient shopping. Lots of shops to ho to under one roof. The pool is so beautiful and fun. I stay here every visit and strongly recommend you should too.
50,Beautiful room with all amenities we needed (and wanted).  Nice location on the strip.  We had everything we needed at Caesar's to celebrate our collective 50th birthday.  We'll definitely be back next year to celebrate our 51st!
50,We were in a premium suite in the Palace tower which was fabulous. It has bedroom living area with large dining table 2 1/2 baths mini kitchen. We brought our own coffee pods because we had read the pods from the mini bar were $14.00 for 4 pods. The view was not exceptional but ok. It looked out over the pools but our room happen to have a ledge which blocked most of the pool view. For us the value great as the room was comped. Do not know the normal prince. It appeared to be maybe 1400 sq feet. The living room had an L shaped couch which I suppose 2 people could sleep on if needed. I liked the location of the Palace tower. If you use the pool a lot this tower's elevators are located right at the pool entrance. The Augustus Tower elevators were close to Palace casino area & Forum tower elevators were closest to the Forum Casino food court poker room and sports bet areas. We did not use the mini bar but there was a price list.
40,It must have been about 1977 the first time I stayed there.todays Caesars is much different the foods good and up scale the party all ways on the gaming has not changed all that much. Table has higher limits not any 5 cent machines. Now it 5 dollars. I took my wife there for my 7 star trip the room was on floor 38 and was grate. The buffet was real good food the cost was 65 dollars a head. We ate there twice and ever thing was top of top. We ate breakfast at Harris across the street. More down to earth bacon and eggs.good fruit bar. I played about 13 k got 4 W2 3 for 2000 one fore 4000.
30,We paid to upgrade to the Palace Tower but the windows were so dirt encrusted we couldn‚Äôt even see the view. Plugs In our room number 1512 didn‚Äôt work. We had to buy extension cords at our expense for a necessary oxygen machine. These deficiencies were reported but not rectified during our 5 day stay. No effort made whatsoever. To add insult to injury they attempted to charge us for all the food in the mini bar which we never touched. The front desk clerk kept telling us we shouldn‚Äôt have opened the fridge. We didn‚Äôt! Pathetic customer service with the exception of the bell desk. Book a friendlier hotel because there are plenty.
50,All staff been friendly courteous and helpful and this was my memorable birthday celebration ever inspite of my temporary medical disability at this time..I plan to go back agsin come December with same group of friends and plan to invite more of them so they can expetience too what I had..
50,We stayed in the Augustus tower and had a great time. We even had our 2 children with us and they loved the Forum Shops. They loved the gelato the sky in the Fourm shops and the pools. We will be back. Just wish the resort fees were so high.
50,Nice good size rooms. Very friendly staff food was very good but some was pricey. Was on a business trip and the meeting facilities were laid out good for our meetings. The old Homestead steakhouse was one of the best steaks ever.
50,Vacation in Vegas with family and friends for my 50th birthday. Enjoyed an amazing room in the Caesars Palace Augustus Tower with view overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Great room great location at center strip fun casino and lots of great eating options.
50,Do you have mobility issues and feel you cannot go to a restaurant or show in Las Vegas?  I say ‚Äî yes you can!  Saturday had dinner at Gordon Ramsey‚Äôs ‚ÄúHell‚Äôs Kitchen ‚Äú and saw ‚ÄúJourney‚Äù at Caesar‚Äôs Palace using a mobility cart.  Had a great time at both venues‚Äî servers and staff were super helpful. Food and show were superb.  Started at he Paris Hotel and got to and from the restaurant and show without any access problems (stairs lack of access ramps and so on).  Very enjoyable evening even with mobility issues.
50,Everything was great as usual. I have the best host in the world Ms. Luetta Pruette made our trip stress free. I would recommend her to all my family and friends. thank you again for everything. You are the absolute BEST!!
40,Beautiful large room with a great view. Nothing to fault with the room. Cannot believe that the minority now of people smoke yet as an ashmatic I have to walk through all the smokers to get anywhere within the hotel. Come on Nevada Hotels at least make a smoking area for those that do on tables etc and cater for those that don't or don't want to get cancer from someones 2nd hand smoke! I refused to gamble for that reason at any of the hotels....
50,Amazing trip. Stayed here because I love The Hangover movie. Zandra at check in was so kind and so great. I can honestly say that because of her help I had the greatest stay at any hotel I‚Äôve ever been
20,I recently stayed at Caesars and forgot my hanging articles of clothing in the closet. 5 expensive clothing items to be exact! I wasn‚Äôt due to check out until the next day but I left the night before. I had spoken to the maids in the hallway and told them if they could service my room. When I called to retrieve my left behind items they were nowhere to be found have not been turned in apparently toy disappeared. Nothing has since been turned in and they were obviously taken some brand new with tags. Obviously I will not be staying there again as the maids are not trustworthy. I have made several phone calls to my casino host along with multiple emails and phone calls to the management all to be ignored and passed off. I am a Diamond member with the hotel. Apparently they can afford to lose loyal customers as easily as they ‚Äúlost‚Äù my items!
30,Spent 4 nights total at a Caesars hotel first night in a regular room then 2 in a suite and last night in a regular room all part of a package. The people in charge of the wedding were amazing but as far as the hotel they didnt seem to care once they got your money.
50,We stayed in the Octavious tower for a 5 night Vegas getaway. The room itself was very spacious and clean. Same with the luxury bathroom with jacuzzi tub.    It was not overly crowded when we stayed so even getting a chair by the pool was reasonable. A few pools were closed for the duration of our stay but the main ones were open and this was not an issue for us.    There are several restaurants on the resort and a huge luxury shopping area that is themed like the streets of Italy including a replica Trevi Fountain that was awesome. The resort is huge so be prepared to walk a lot!    The location of the resort is perfect! One of the best on the strip if not the best! You can walk to most places from the hotel and what you can‚Äôt reach you can take a short bus ride or Uber.    As a con it does come with a hefty resort fee but most hotels on the strip do so we included it as simply part of the room rate and didn‚Äôt let it bother us.
30,Caesars is absolutely gorgeous with great views! They have a quick response concierge texting feature. The check in process was slow but it was quick to check out. We were accidentally charged for 17.00 beef jerky so make sure to watch your charges.    Customer service could be a little quicker.
50,Amazing decor very friendly and helpful staff beautiful pool deckfabulous concert venue. In a city with some very tacky and outdated hotels Caesars Palace is beautifully done reasonably priced and has some good shopping on -site (not just the high-end shops either!). We had a mini suite in the Palace Tower and it was huge...two bathrooms full living area view of the pool (and at the same price of a standard small room at Aria where we were the week prior). Its the only place we will book to stay in the future!
10,Terrible rating system always to the benefit of this hotel. The rating is just purely and utterly unacceptable. Charges were made that should not have appeared on the bill. Very disappointed I am very easily pleased but the hotel did their best to disappoint me and they succeeded
50,nice hotel and very good casino and shops. the service is very professional five stars restaurants. good place to visit whith friends family or couples.we recomended the shows and take pictures for yours memorys.
50,The lady at the Diamond Lounge where I checked in was so nice and very jolly. It was so refreshing that somebody in that department was able to assist me in such a manner considering the fact that I drove for so many miles from California and a bit tired. Me and my wife always stay in Caesars but never I met such a very nice very courteous and also entertaining person in the Diamond Lounge. She is an asset of the property.
50,If you are looking for a fun and friendly location to stay and play in Las Vegas consider Caesars Palace as your central location. You can find lots of selections of food and a wonderful choice of slots to play and enjoy drinks delivered by very attentative staff.
50,From pool cabana to a private room at Alto Bar to watch football... could not have been better.  Special thanks to our host Shant for all his help.  Eighteen guys had a blast!  TopGolf and fine dining at Delmonico added to the experience. Emeril‚Äôs is hard to beat. Great food and excellent service. Thanks Mr.Tran.
50,4377 Augustas Tower-would have preferred a view of the fountains but this room was actually quieter and we have seen the water show from your neighbor. Enjoyed our meals at Rao and Gordon Ramsey. Meal at the coffe shop was good.
50,This place has it all. From beautiful common areas and rooms great food entertainment great shows cocktails gambling and shopping at the forum shops. We spent the 80% of the 4 day weekend on the property. Every time we decided to go somewhere else we found it here. There were multiple options so we did not get bored. Quality everywhere. It is pricy everything from drinks to table minimums is a little bit more. Watch out for the $18.00 cocktails. I did feel like Caesar enjoying the opulent lifestyle.
40,Caesars is conveniently located across the street from all of the other Caesars properties... it's a beautiful hotel. When you're staying try the Qua spa you'll fall in love with it. Once we came we've never stopped. You will feel so relaxed. It's equipped with all your needs. Can't wait to go bac!!!
50,Still on top of their game. Beautiful room fun Casino. Great restaurants and good location to get everywhere else on the strip. Employees were friendly and helpful. Will stay here again next time.  Rao restaurant delicious.
40,Rooms are spacious clean and very comfortable  Lots of options on the gaming floor  Pools are great!  Food options are many  Only downside.....everything is more expensive than you might expect i.e. $7 soda in mini bar no free coffee in the room
40,Room was very nice property was in a good location and everything I needed was on the property grounds. Dealers were friendly. I tend to get cold easily and the air conditioning was too cold for my preference.
50,Really nice room with jacuzzi. Nice shopping and very nice sports book and gaming. The staff was very helpful. The night club Omnia was very fun and the DJ‚Äôs are very good. They have one of the best pools I‚Äôve ever been to.
50,"Welcome to the Fabulous Las Vegas !!! I would say the Fabulous is ""Caesars Palace""    Caesars Palace in Las Vegas is a next level of Entertainment Shopping Fun Tourism Partying Dining Gambling Nightlife Clubbing ect..It's around the clock entertainment hub in Las Vegas everything that you could ever imagine you would experience inside Caesars.    Although every tourist comes to Las Vegas can experience the Caesars entertainmenthowever staying at this hotel will certainly makes the trip more exciting. I stayed at Caesars hotel for 6 nights undoubtedly every moment I spent there is a life-time memory. I do not have words to define their exceptional Service Room comfort & amenities Hospitality. And the fun & dining experiences I had at Caesars.It's not just 5 It's a 10-Star experience.    Thank you Caesars !!!!"
50,Yet another great trip altho it would have been better had we at least broken even....but that is not realistic is it? LOL. What a nice property and classic Caesars goes on and on. Staff is excellent. Shopping and dining options are more than you can ask for We have been coming to Caesars for 40 years and while we have stayed at many of the resorts in LV none tops Caesars for overall experience.
50,It was a great experience for me. This was my first trip to Vegas my son got married at Caesars palace.  The hotel is spectacular and all employees treated me with respect. I will be coming back to Vegas again and I would highly Recommend Caesars palace to anyone.
50,We actually stayed at Harrah's. If we had to do it again Caesars Palace may be the hotel of choice. We enjoyed the Steve Martin/Martin Short show there. We also enjoyed the atmosphere. Many other great shows are upcoming that would be very enjoyable.
50,Excellent place to stay and eat. Great rewards and friendly atmosphere. Clean and safe place to stay. Will enjoy coming back for more fun and excitement. Will enjoy the next adventure with Caesars properties
50,We experienced excellent service from Caesars Palace employees from the moment we checked into the casino flooreven when we watched the Journey's concertwe had a terrific welcome from the employees. We also enjoyed the spacey room that we had and it's cleanliness.
10,Not worth the money at all! Staff are rude rooms are not as nice as the other hotels on the strip. Staff laughed at our booked room and said it was the low end of the hotel. They advised to pay more just to get a ‚Äúdecent‚Äù room. I paid $60 more per night and still severely disappointed. Stay away!
50,Exceptional quality and cleanliness of rooms with exceptionally great views. Resort had friendly team members that meet the needs of guests no matter what your level of players status is. Spa experience is GREAT too!
10,I was just here for a conference and had an overall underwhelming experience.    Check-In-About a 10minute wait. I used the automatic check in kiosks which worked fine.    Rooms-Stayed in Forum Tower which is basically out of the 70s. Scratched up furniture scuffed up baseboards paint needs updating. Two elevators not working so trips to room took long. Terrible rooms you can not call this luxury. I actually went back to reception to explain the condition of the room but was told they were full and could not move me.    Spa Pool Gym-I was excited to hit the pool after a long evening flight to find out only that it closed at 6p. Huh? This is Vegas. They gym closes at 8p. I can't remember the last time I was at a hotel that did not have a 24h gym or at least close to that.    Anyway I do not recommend the Forum Tower maybe the other towers are more updated and maybe our conference booked the lower prices rooms but this hotel is not worth visiting. Plenty of better options on the strip.
30,We recently stayed at the Ceasars forum suite and were very disappointed with the overall appearance of the luxury suite at the forum. All of the area also smelled like sewage the whole weekend. Very disappointed because we‚Äôve always come to ceasars and this is not like them. The casino machines were also not working like the electronic roulette and alot of the areas appeared dirty. Ceasars you all are better than this.
40,Caesars is slap bang in the middle of the strip so the location is perfect. I found check in time quite late and was assigned a room at 4pm. We opted out for room service but didn‚Äôt get our towels changed which we agreed would happen. The resort itself looks fantastic very luxurious and it‚Äôs huge. Everything you need is there at Caesars but be prepared to pay big bucks for it. I didn‚Äôt find the casino staff overly friendly compared to the Bellagio next door. If i was visiting Vegas again I would probably pick a different resort.
40,Overall room was very clean spacious minor issues. Food court and snack areas were very expensive. Slots were loose. Casino was not too smokey. Casino was clean. All staff were helpful. I would highly recommend
30,Spent 3 nights here from September 30-Oct 3rd. Rooms decent beds comfortable-housekeeping staff did amazing job to replenish supplies. Central location on the strip tons to see and do in the motel itself.Restaurants wonderful. Concierge did wonderful job at recommendations of shows. Donw side checking inawful ..........long wait in line. When we booked had arranged early checkin but room not available..desk said they would text us but did not and 7 hours went by. Unable to use bar fridge do to sensors...DONT PICK ANYTHING UP OR TAKE OUT OF FRIDGE YOU WILL BE CHARGED. We lifted boxes of snacks..they have sensors also and were billed to room on checkout. For the exuberant resort fee fridge should be included and there were 3 of us in room but only 2 allowed free wifi..come on really!! Gentlemen on checkin could have smiled a bit more..we are inVegas!! We did see a sneak peek of Rod Stewart surprising couple at there wedding there and heard him sing for free!!
50,Of all the casinos I visit Caesars is my favorite. The suites are amazing with a great view of the Bellagio fountain. The staff are all friendly and willing to help. Caesars has the best filters to filter out the smoke
30,The room and pools were very nice but the casino services fell flat. If you are accustomed to being comped for rooms and meals at other hotels Caesars does not seem to fall in line with how other casinos handle guests that typical play at other hotels. In addition the casino staff seemed to need a bit more training both on the phone as well as in person.
50,Room in Octavia Tower was Lovely. Staff very helpful and kind. Will always stay at Caesars Palace when I am taking a trip to Las Vegas. Starbucks was supposed to be 24 hours but it was not and they charged $2 for a cup of water but that was Starbucks not Caesar‚Äôs Palace!
50,Stayed at the Flamingo. Very nice place. The Linq Promenade is s great experience. Lots of places to eat street life and shows. Saw the comedy show at Jimmy Kimmel's it was great. Went to Caesar's Palace and saw Dionne Warwick at The Barge and ate the Mesa Grill both were great experiences. If you're a Crap Shooter the Cromwell offers the best odds in Vegas. All these places are a 5 minute walk from each other and all are Caesar's properties. Staff at all places was did an excellent job.
40,We enjoyed good service and a good dining experience. We loved the concert of Journey. The Colosseum is a great venue.The casino was awesome as well. The hotel is a very Beautiful hotel. We had a great time.
50,Professional and friendly employees. Rooms were very clean. Welcoming treats were amazing! There were so many restaurants to chose from from inexpensive to expensive. Love everything about our stay thank you!
50,Place has been redone and is now just as good or better then any hotel on the strip.  I live on the east coast and have been going to AC for years . This was a complete shock to me how clean and beautiful las vegas Caesars is compared to the one in AC
40,always enjoy everything Caesars Palace has to offer. My only gripe would be the money grab the place has turned into! They charge you to sit in a seat almost everywhere including the sportsbook and many bars!
30,This is the third time that we have stayed here at Caesars Palace. We are always in town for a conference every year which is held on-site which is the reason why we get the room here.  Although we love the pool and the mid strip location of the hotel what we've noticed this time is a deterioration of some special aspects that we have enjoyed in the past.. No longer can we get bathrobes to the room; which we count on to enjoy since we've had it on every prior stay! Also we opted it not to have the room cleaned towels refreshed or beds made during the four nights we stayed here. What was our reward for that? A single $10 voucher! What a joke. Considering it takes the cleaning staff at least 20 to 30 minutes to thoroughly clean the room the $10 voucher should be per night right? And on top of that there are very few places that honor the $10.00 discount!.  So congratulations on trying to protect the environment but shame on the hotel administration for not rewarding people appropriately that saved your cleaning crew time effort as well as washing and drying towels and sheets using electricity and water 4 times.  Rethink what should be offered in place of daily room servicing!
10,I‚Äôm annoyed every time I stay here (with a conference). They charge $33 resort fee but then have the nerve to charge $14 tto use the coffee service in the room. And would charge a $75 fee for using the inroom fridge. In addition I had outrageous fee for a call that didn‚Äôt even go through. I would Never stay here on my own. Be warned.
40,The rooms at Caesars are always very clean. I was very surprised to hear from an employee that Caesars opened in the 60s. It is kept very well and I always noticed employees cleaning the casino. I just wish there were more 5 dollar tables
50,We stayed in the Augustus Tower where the rooms are large and very comfortable. There is a nice sitting area which I appreciate. Beds are great bathrooms are also large. The Casino is elegant and exciting.
50,We stayed in the Augustus tower which was just amazing. Beautiful large room with wonderful bathroom. The pool was great. The grounds are so pretty. Location is perfect. Would highly recommended to anyone.
50,Wonderful visit staff are extremely helpful and accommodating. Rooms and view of the fountains are beautiful. Great selection of restaurants on the property. The spa is wonderful as are all the services offered in the spa.
40,Great things... easy self check in elevators were working on the District 1 section the room was modern and recently renovated. All you have to do is call for things not in the room. I get it not everyone drinks coffee ~ call and ask for one. Safe and refrigerator both were nice touches. The casino is lively with great sections to play it from the party person to the sports fanatic. I enjoyed my stay. The only meh point would have been the pool ~ could use a little update on the lounge chairs ~ the day beds were well worth the upgrade. And there is way to much to choose from it this hotel doesn't fit all your needs. Cheers ~ remember if you want Caesar's then stay at Caesar's this is a great middle of the road kind boutique hotel.
50,Beautiful hotel and pool complex. We stayed in a Classic Suite and while it did have an old cigarette smell other than that it was gorgeous. Went and bought some plug ins at Bath & Body Wrks in the Forum Shops and all was good!  The Pool complex and shopping are great diversions during the day and the Casino is huge open and airy at night.
50,We had so much fun to watch Journeys concert. A very good place to have a vacation. Excellent place for fun and entertainment helpful and friendly staff. nice and clean room will definitely come back
50,Stayed at Paris in room 1902p. Ate dinner at Mr Chow at Ceasars. Played video poker at ParisCaesars and Planet Hollywood. Visited the Diamond Lounge at Paris.Had Brunch at Planet Hollywood. Hit Jack pots at Ceasars Ballys Paris and Planet Hollywood.
50,Beautiful spacious room with sofa. Large bathroom with double sinks and a great shower. Rao‚Äôs for a birthday dinner was perfect. Next night ate at the buffet. A little expensive but very good. It was a great trip. We even won a little!
30,Room was a bit outdated. Some table games were not functioning at all. The steam room in the mens spa room was out of order. The bell desk where they hold your bags needs a better operating procedure.
50,Wonderful experience - Caesars was clean and pretty. Loved our view from the room of the strip with the Bellagio fountains and the Paris hotel. The location was perfect with easy access to everything on the strip food the shows that we saw. We were also able to rent a car to drive to Red Rock Canyon to hike. We all enjoyed the fantastic pool area and casino as well.
50,My experience at Caesars Palace was an outstanding one. It was the fourth time staying there and it has been tremendous every time that I have stayed there. The room was in great condition and housekeeping was terrific. The service at the front desk porter area valet service and casino area was top-notch. You notice right way the customer-friendly attitude that the employees at Caesars Palace takes. I definitely give my experience at Caesars Palace a fourth ‚Äúthumbs up‚Äù.
50,The perfect property to never leave. They have everything I want. Casino good food and a great spa. Room service was on point and the transportation arrangements provided were perfect. My host was able to get me everything I needed to make my stay great
50,I absolutely loved my stay at Caesars Palace. Immediately upon check-in without request I was upgraded to a junior suite. This property has everything you could ever need so you don't need to leave if you don't want to. Between the amazing restaurants the cleanliness the customer service and the great selection of gambling options-this was a great place to stay. I had stayed at the property one time previously for a trip with my employer and was very pleased to come back. I will absolutely be staying here again in the future.
50,I was given a diamond card and loved the many lines I saved the comp dinner and the overall staff was very friendly and helpful. The slots were a little tight but the view from our room was stupendous not to mention the wonderful sleep we had due to the mattress on the bed.
50,Best Sportsbook!  Best SPA!  Best POOL!  Great restaurants!  Very good location great shows great shopping...Excellent comps if you are a player...  The nightclub is the BEST in Vegas..  All the employees are nice and informative.
40,Here for a conference I don't generally like coming to Las Vegas since I don't gamble and don't have a lot of interest in going to shows but the property is very nice staff friendly and it is well maintained. The one down-side is that if you order your favorite pizza from outside the restaurant they can't deliver it to your room. You have to go outside to their Uber pick-up area to meet your delivery person.
50,Everything was nice except the loooooooooonnnnnnnnngggggggg walk from the elevator to the room. Caesars is still a very nice place to stay. Lots of food options. Valet parking was easy. Too bad they allow smoking in the sports book though.
50,We stayed in the Augustus Tower. The room was amazing. It overlooked the fountain at Bellagio. The room was neat and clean. There is something to do for everyone at Caesars. You can't go wrong. The staff were very friendly and helpful.
50,Trip was good The room was really good and everything as I expected I will definitely go again for a fun time. I really enjoyed the amount of things that you are able to do in Las Vegas and really felt as though I didnt have enough time to do what I wanted to do. Until next time I guess.
40,We may not be able to afford the rooms but we love it there so we always make our way over to Caesars to gamble and to experience the restaurants & the mall...just to take in the atmosphere. We love it there....plus we tend to have some luck when we gamble which is a bonus!
50,Rooms are clean and staff is friendly. Harrahs is located in the middle of the strip so very accessible to other Caesars facilitys and shopping malls. All you need to do is ask and the employees of Harrahs make it happen. Great experience always!
50,This beautiful hotel and casino has it all and is by far the best property owned by Caesar's Entertainment. It has great rooms is located in the heart of the Strip and has a very nice casino that is not too loud but has something for everyone. It has the very best Sports Book in Vegas and the customer service is outstanding. For the best stay in Vegas book here!
30,Long lines need more service help. Waited in a long line to check in and out. Also rewards line was long. Came back at opening time and lady helped people behind me after I had been waiting fir it to open for 20 minutes.
50,Fabulous service great atmosphere and exceptional dining options. The people at Caesars provide exceptional service every time we visit. Also the golfing in Vegas has so many excellent options. The courses are in great shape in fall and spring and that is a great time to get away from cold and rain at home. The gaming tables employees also provide helpful assistance if you are not and expert.
40,A great place to stay but hard to get around in because of its size. If u have mobility issues this is not the place to stay. Overall the staff is professional and helpful. I was disappointed that I did not get the room location that I reserved.
50,Excellent experience from beginning to end. We will only be staying at Caesars palace going foward and hope to come back soon. The gaming of great and the atmosphere cannot be beat especially at the pool.
50,Easy to check in with a person and easy to check out through the kiosk as well as their service personnel are very customer focus. Just make sure you let them know not to put you in a pet acceptable floor if you are allergic.
30,Our room was clean but very out of date. Not enough plug-ins for our electronics. I had to unplug the lamp next to the bed so I had an outlet to use. The hairdryer needs to be replaced. Staff is very friendly.
20,Been going to Vegas for 24 years now always staying on the strip but trying to stay in different hotels. Tried Caesars and have never been so disappointed. Rooms were average but they tried to nickel and dime you on everything. From potentially charging for the in-room refrigerator to coffee to multiple internet connections not to mention their ridiculous resort fee. Apparently gambling is no longer the way casinos make money. They'd rather take it out in fees. We won't be staying at Caesars again and if the rest of Vegas becomes the same we'd be better off taking a cruise.
50,If your looking for delux room accommodation and luxury entertainment there's nothing like Caesars hotel and casino. Our room was clean provided with many amenities and comfort one almost doesn't want to get out of bed. Our view of the many swimming pools was breath taking. Room was spacious as well as the closets. Many eateries bars shopping areas and of course gambling tables and slot machines. The decor every where was luxurious. Expense well yes. You get what you pay for and some! Employees helpful and friendly knowledgeable and courteous. I give it a ten and will definitely be returning hopefully for another great concert.
50,Great room and view. I typically come to Vegas once a year. Had not stayed at Caesars in a couple of years. Nice upgrade to the palace tower. All employees checking in were very welcoming.    There was a foul order in the palace tower lobby area sewer smell. Other than that had a great stay.
40,Excellent hotel and rooms in general but as with most major Las Vegas hotels on the strip the massive size was daunting and lots of walking just within the hotel many times a day just to get from the room to the many entrances/exits restaurants etc. The Forum Tower room we stayed in was not very large but good-sized check-in and out was smooth with friendly and helpful staff but housekeeping was slow in responding to requests. Wide range of eating options inside the hotel including a small food court but far better and more reasonable options available just along and across the street all up and down the strip. Off-putting was a charge of $75 for using the room mini bar/fridge for even opening it and putting in your own water beer or anything. Plus no complimentary tea/coffee in the room. Such nickle-and-diming by a premier hotel was not pleasant.
50,Great rooms great amenities Qua spa is awesome and very relaxing very comfortable robes and very nice hot tubs. Great line up of restaurants as well Nobu ans Mesa griio are . Looking forward to staying again.
40,Definitely enjoyed staying here Wagga easily among the top hotels in Vegas (beware those in the old strip area as very tired in comparison).    Great rooms room service and nice view of Bellagio fountains.  Downsides literally everything costs (and a lot). First time I've ever seen a charge for putting your own water in the mini bar $75!).  Service was quite slow and always huge queues. On-site food was expensive and fairly basic.
40,That was my first expirience in Vegas. I got the Augustus Strip View Room. Amazing view very comfortable. The hotel is so big that leaving my room until my car in the self parking was a 15 minutes travel.
40,This was our first time staying at this hotel. Our room was not ready when we checked in at almost midnight on a Monday. They gave us a very nice suite to accommodate. The hotel was very nice but it was a bit too BIG for us. A lot of walking to get to the casino our room food area. We checked out the following day and went to Paris Hotel which is where we usually stay. I'm sure this hotel is fine for others but for us we preferred a more low key place. All the employees I dealt with at Caesars were very friendly and accommodating.
40,Quick checkin great property location. Easy access to strip for sightseeing and activities. High floor room clean with nice view of fountain show. All staff encountered was friendly helpful with a smile
50,Quality resort the rooms pool & Wayne Newton were awesome!! Food & drinks pricey but expect to pay at an upscale resort. Take your own coffee pods if you must have it first thing. We stayed in the Octavius tower pool view room bed and room were fab. Do not opt out of housekeeping because we needed our bedding replaced due to a spill & they wouldn't do it. I called twice & was told no. Really? after spending all that? They should be more flexible. My husband gave the housekeeper a tip & she cleared it with her supervisor to redo our bed. a bit of a hassle. Otherwise great room. Wayne Newton is a real priceless treasure & we enjoyed every minute of the show. Buy your drinks/snacks at CVS. Would stay there again absolutely.
50,Very pleasant trip. Many options for dining and shopping for family. We went to see Journey concert at the Caesars Coliseum and it was completely sold out. The Coliseum was perfect for the concert with the stage and sound systems. The hotel and casino is right in the center of the Las Vegas Blvd strip convenient for vacationers.
50,I always return to Caesars Palace when I want to experience the best of Las Vegas... the ‚Äúvibe‚Äù is old-school yet very much up-to-date. Add in a friendly helpful and highly professional staff (I particularly commend those at check-in housekeeping - which is second to none - and Caesars Rewards) a great collection of restaurants (Bobby Flay‚Äôs Mesa Grill is still going strong - and serving delicious food - after fifteen years) superb pool area and the best Race and Sports Book in town. This visit I was upgraded to a very nice room in the Octavius Tower (shout-out for the mattress towels and ‚Äúrain forest‚Äù shower head). Well it‚Äôs the complete can‚Äôt-be-beat package. I‚Äôve just returned home and already I can‚Äôt wait for my next visit!
30,"We were shocked at added fees including: A $75.00 fee for ""using"" the refrigerator for cans of pop we purchased; price for using Keurig Coffee - would NEVER pay that price; only able to connect 2 devices on the internet without paying addition fee. Unless these fees are removed we will NEVER be staying at Caesar's again."
40,This was a nice spacious room however so many expensive e cost just to have access to mini fridge or have un room coffee. The pools were very nice yet some were just mainly for show and rather on the chilly side. Also just to sit on some of the pool chairs required an up charge for daily rental. Drink cost and food were also way out of proportions compared to other Harrahs properties we have stayed at.
50,I had a wonderful experience visiting Caesars! It started with the amazing customer service from Anselmo in accommodating my needs upon checking. His attentiveness professionalism and welcoming personality took customer service to the next level. I also especially liked Ivy the personal mobile concierge. These coupled with the impeccable room made me certain that I will be staying here for all my future trips!
40,Caesar's Palace is absolutely gorgeous and has every amenity one could want.  however food and beverage prices are incredibly high as well. The Journey concert that I attended was phenomenal! Seating placement was beyond my expectations and the hall was spacious and beautiful. The performance was great but too loud for me. I could actually feel the vibrations from the volume.
50,My lady and I loved every minute of our visit! The gentleman at the check in was so accommodating welcoming and friendly. The Agustus room was gorgeous and had an incredible view of the strip. We can't wait to go back!!!!!
40,The hotel was fine I was only there for two nights. I was told that I would get a credit I‚Äôve $10 at the food court or restaurants if I clean my room myself or not have a maid clean my room for me. This is a sham. They leave out important information. My room was fine I had a good nights rest I had a good workout in the gym everything else was fine.
40,Visited 2nd week of Oct 2019 during mid week with a group of friends. This happened to be a quieter week I suppose the room price dropped to $95+fee/tax great value. Our room was in Octavius tower facing Paris and north side of Bellagio room was a good size. It's close to the pool and buffet. Heated pool was great. Buffet has a good selection however the cold seafood caused my stomach discomfort. The boiled alaska crab was great. In all we had a good stay and would come back again.
50,Such a fun trip even though business related. Got there and stood in line for a while finally were checking in and Anselmo looked so hard to give us the king no smoking that we reserved. When it was not available we got a free upgrade. Beautiful room very comfortable. Very happy.
30,Bring your own water and coffee! Not the elite status hotel it portrays. Customer service subpar and my renovated room was not worth the $1590 for 5 nights. Go to the Bellagio for quality or better yet save money and go to The Flamingo. Rooms were newer!
30,Arrived around 7.30pm complete chaos in drop off area badly managed. Decided to use self check in machine - it picked up our booking and advised room was not yet ready... at 7.30pm?! Queued for desk and checked in we were towards back of hotel in Palace Tower so quite a walk got to room and it was well equipped however not properly cleaned - chips under table and what looked like salt on sofa - considered phoning to complain however in the end didn't want to waste time waiting for housekeeping to resolve as only there one night. Left over room service trolleys outside in corridor uncleared too.
50,We liked the fact that this was separate from the main hotel. You also had you own gym and the room was very spacious. The bed was very comfortable and the pillows very amazing as well. The turn down service was awesome. I would highly recommend this hotel.
30,Check-in at Caesars was not a pleasant experience. We had made a reservation months in advance and sent an email notification the morning of our arrival confirming our stay. Upon check-in at 4:15 PM we were told our room in the Augusta Tower was not ready yet and we would receive an email when it came available. After a 1 & 1/2 hour wait and no email we checked back at the desk and told our room was still not ready yet. Now keep in mind that the housekeeping staff leaves at 5:00 PM and it was now 5:45. After another 30 minutes with our patience wearing thin we requested to talk to a manager. Believe it or not before we got to talk to a manager our room was ready. Throughout our stay there were more issues but suffice to say Caesars over promises and under delivers especially when they market themselves as a top flight Vegas hotel.
50,Stayed at the palace tower and the rooms were big clean and ready on time. I love the diamond checkin where it allows you free early checkin and no lines. Caesars palace is center strip with easy walking distance to any other hotel and property you desire to go to.
40,This makes the third hotel in Vegas that I've stayed at (first was Mirage and second was New York New York). The staff are friendly and bed is really comfy. My issues are price and coffee in the room. They offer a Keurig machine but you have to pay for the K cups. For the price you think it'd be included right?
50,My mother and I are handicapped and we travel to Las Vegas once a year for vacation. I come from Dallas she comes from St.Louis. We Had the most enjoyable time at Caesar‚Äôs Palace the staff is incredible. A week before we left we were looking for some travel information as I mentioned we are handicapped so traveling any where has to be well planned out in advance. We had our first experience with Caesar‚Äôs staff with Edie from the concierge desk she called us multiple times about our plans was patient when we couldn‚Äôt decide then when we arrived she took time out of her day to find us and meet us in person.  I was dropped off by a shuttle from the airport a bit of a distance from the hotel with 2 large suitcases and a carry on Eugene in valet spotted me came all the way down to where I was grabbed my luggage told me to sit went and got me a mobility scooter and made sure I was taken care of. The entire staff was generous and kind. They truly were the best staff at any hotel we have ever stayed at.  Thank You Caesar‚Äôs Palace
50,We always stay here at Caesars Palace because it‚Äôs the best one on the strip! We are in the middle of everything the food and atmosphere is great and the rooms are spacious! I‚Äôve been here 4 times now and have always stayed at Caesars. Thanks for showing us a good time ALL OF THE TIME!!!
50,Room is very clean and spacious hallways are bright and safe. The casino floor is not too crowded with machines. There's a lot of food places to eat. Buffet is pricey though. Employees are very helpful. I asked for a room near elevator but then the lady at the check in counter placed us at Palace tower which is the furthest from the casino floor but it very quiet .
30,Everything in this hotel is expensive - from the rooms to the Cheetos in the Essentials store ($7.95 for a regular bag which we took back). Definitely go off-site to eat if you're here for a few days. My husband has accessibility needs and for the most part the entire hotel is accessible. Whomever designs roll-in showers need to ask the cleaning staff first. I felt sorry for them. The first day water everywhere! It drains right out of the shower to the back of the toilet. We got smarter and laid out towels before showering. Not very safe if you have a handicapped person walking from the shower to the door! We only stayed here because it was where my husband's conference was and we got a good price on rooms. Wouldn't be my first choice next time.
40,Always a good time at Caesars palace. Lots of food choices great shopping and nice variety of slots. I live in vegas and attended the rod stewart concert at the coliseum. Getting into the venue was ok. Getting out however was just stupid. They need more escalators getting out of the venue
50,Amazing chances to win at Caesars palace. I call that FAIR PLAY. No other casino has given me this fair play. Best services extended by Caesars palace when u enroll in their membership program. Free play and comp rooms are also given by Caesars palace
40,Pros..very nice room clean and spacious room service is extremely good called front desk requesting more hangers and they were delivered within 10 minutes  Cons...food and drinks are very pricey casino is very smokey at night
50,When we want to get away and pamper ourselves Caesars Palace is our go to escape! There is so much to do from walking the strip people watching to seeing shows eating great food etc. We always find the people at Caesars to be friendly  Helpful and they just make you feel special!
50,Went to Caesars Palace to see the group Journey in Concert. Stayed three days. Caesars is very large and the staff was very helpful with directions to get around. The room was very modern and clean no problems. We did not leave the hotel in three days. So many choices for eating and entertainment.
50,The rooms are great . There is so much to do. There are great options for dining and drinking  terriffic shows the best shopping and gaming. Diamond rewards is by far the best. Check in and check out is very convenient.
50,Our stay at Caesars Palace was amazing. Beautiful hotel spacious rooms excellent service friendly staff excellent WiFi connection and a great location. Thank you to the entire team! My husband & I will be back :)
50,the room was great and location nicelove the pool and of course the Giada Express area is amazingexcellent choices so you can play without going out of your way for the fantastic foodshopping is very nice throughout Caesars and mall
50,Caesar's Palace has been our favorite hotel to stay every time we are in Las Vegas.  Beautiful architectural property supported by professional staff and truly make us feel as we are in top notch resort for the weekend's rest and enjoyment.  Just browsing around shopping is a day's joy.
40,We stayed at Caesars Palace. Very Cool place to stay. We had a nice view of the main drag (Las Vegas Ave). Nice food court in the casino. Cool Mall connecting to the back part of the casino. Located in the center of most attractions.
10,Caesars is a nightmare hotel. You are walk-in and the strong Tobacco and Cigar smell makes you nauseous within 15 minutes. There is absolutely nowhere to go within the hotel to get away from it. Front Desk Manager Ray said we could go stand outside. This man is a low class manager with no resolution skills who just clicks the computer mouse and does not resolve anything. Daniel on the other hand a front desk agent try to do the best he could to accommodate us and seemed empathetic. The housekeeping runners knock on your door even with the DND sign on the door. They knock loud are rude and act oblivious to see you are sleeping. My hairdryer was broken they took forever to bring one I decided to go to sleep with my her wet I called to cancel request and put DND sign on door. A guy by the name of Evan (older white male with dark hair and green or Hazel eyes) knocks on door Im already asleep its around 1130pm. Shows me hair dryer but does not give it to me until he gets the broken one back. He says its gotta be a trade. I go get the broken one and tell him I had cancelled the request And that I didn‚Äôt appreciate him knocking while DND sign is on the door. He said he never got the cancellation via text. At 830am the next morning while the DND sign is still on the door I get a knock on the door and man is holding a brand new hairdryer. I was asleep and so upset I just tell him I got one last night. This place is atrocious! All The pools are not always opened despite every chair being occupied and guests walking around looking for chairs. Pools are full. They do not serve food you have to walk to a venue and bring it inside after a thorough search from the pool staff. This is a low class hotel with center location to the strip. That‚Äôs all. Stay at the Bellagio for an extra $20 or $30. Service is priceless!
50,This was our first trip to Vegas and we wanted to stay somewhere iconic. Cesar‚Äôs is beautiful and packed with everything! Took in a show at the coliseum. Shopped and ate at the forum as well as gambled on site. The casino dealers were very pleasant and the staff quite helpful. Would certainly stay here again and recommend to our friends.
50,Staff and host very friendly. Rooms are nice . Beautiful resort with plenty of dining and shopping options. Amazing pools and spa for one to relax. I recommend the buffet! Definately one of the best on the strip.
50,Enjoyed our stay at the Augustus Tower--great room overlooking the fountains at Bellagio and the strip. Perfect location at Caesars close to the lobby casino Starbucks spa and Laurel Lounge. Staff was warm and couldn't have been better. Ate at Rao's and Old Homestead--both were excellent! Special shout out to Shanon in security. I lost my wallet the first day there--in the morning security had it complete with all my money. She was wonderful!
40,Room was really nice! Large...great view of Bellagio fountains. Bathroom has jetted tuband walk in shower...marble floors...very nice.Bed was comfortable and cleanpillows very nice. Room has sectional couchand plenty of chairs. Flat screen tvand a Keurig coffee maker! Only downside...refrigerator and snack bar seriously overpriced!!! Hotel charges guests 75 dollar fee to be able to use the refrigerator.
50,We received 3 comped nights on our rewards notification; however when we called we asked to stay 4 nights. They reviewed our play and said they could comp us 4 nights. Upon our stay we asked to stay an additional night and they comped us the 5th night as well just based on our play throughout the week. We didn't have to shift to another room for availability. We ate at Gordon Ramsey's restaurant Americano Cafe and Bobby Flay's MESA restaurant. All were fabulous! Great birthday celebration.
50,Elegant clean hotel with first class staff. Very accommodating. From the front desk to the bellhop.Many restaurants to choose from for all tastes. Room was fantastic pool area  stunning with bar service. Try Caesarsyou can't go wrong.
50,Aside from the check in this stay was perfect. Great location lots of shopping and food options. Sports book is large and absolutley the best value for great rooms. Ideally located in the center of everything. Only slight negative is that they ask you to pre-check in then check in prior to 4 then come back after 4 then made me talk to a person when the machine made a mistake anyway- only to be sent back to machine. Just wait til after 4 and do it once. Check bags when you arive for free and enjoy your day in Vegas! Just a great experience otherwise. Definitely stay here.
50,Beautiful clean and extremely comfortable guest room. Fast and friendly check in. Staff acknowledge you throughout the property. Box office could be better staffed but efficient once you are at the window.
50,Caesars is a wonderful resort. You can elect to choose to partake in Caesars rewards where you earn points with dining gambling purchases etc. The spa experience is fabulous. There are so many options with a spa experience that will leave you refreshed for your day. The pool experience is also a wonderful thing to do with your time. There is always someone to bring you something refreshing and luckily the weather cooperated with us. We saw Rod Stewart and it was a fabulous show.
50,Everyone needs to go to Caesars if your in Vegas the buffet is the best the staff is friendly I love this place I try and visit at least once a year here I just love the atmosphere here ever the food court is amazing
50,Whether for a week or a quick get away Ceasars Palace offers everything and anything your heart may desire! We had a great time...as we always do. When you visit Check out Mr. Chow‚Äôs for dinner. It was extraordinary!
40,I had an exceptional room. the food options were vast and the service was outstanding. Management is always extremely helpful and the dealers are always pleasant and engaging. The facility is clean and modern
40,Really enjoyed playing in the casino. The poker room staff was wonderful. The casino staff was fairly friendly making our losses less painful. The Lobby restaurant was not as good as we were hoping but we were able to use player points to discount the meal so that made it sufficient.
50,From the room to the staff to the shops and dinning areas this is the place I stay while in Vegas! I have stayed at a few other places and we now love the location of Caesars and all there partners like the Linq sports book!
10,Caesar's Palace - Resort & Casino.. More like Caesar's Palace - Casino & oh yeah we have some accommodation attached..    Our stay at Caesar's was to say the least unpleasant.. They clearly don't give a damn about their hotel guests unless they're high rollers - not even a welcome on check-in awful unpleasant & unsociable staff no assistance with our bags & they can't even point us in the right direction to get to our room. This may be a standard Vegas thing - but they don't have a complimentary fridge or even complimentary coffee/tea for that matter they even charge you a ludicrous amount if you take anything out or put anything in the mini bar irrespective of consumption. Everything at this hotel is geared towards fleecing their guests out of the most money possible.    The rooms are fairly nice otherwise great bathroom and big comfortable bed but a number of things in our room were faulty and when we asked for them to be fixed we were told they would be but they still weren't. The iron and ironing board seemed like they were purchased from a dollar store there were no robes and there were no slippers.    Absolutely ridiculous that when staying at a place so luxurious they cant even provide the unquestionably basic amenities that you'd get from a country-side $50/night budget motel.    WiFi was also choppy and limited to 2 devices (additional devices cost extra). Again something so basic that this seems so ridiculous to be charged extra for. Half of the pools were also closed at the resort (the main ones) so there was only the crappy pools open at the back.    Overall this was a miserable experience and completed shattered the illusion of the amazing service & opulence of Caesar's that you get from the shows/movies. Completely overrated totally tacky disgustingly dirty supremely scummy and utterly useless. Wouldn't recommend staying here an absolute waste of money and degradation to your self respect 1/10.
30,air conditioning at night is evidently turned off. our friends rooms were also hot at night so it wasn't just us. Hopefully they can remedy this if we are to stay there again. I have to keep typing because it has to be 200 characters....so to reiterate it was hot in our rooms at night.
50,Zandra at the front desk made our start of our vacation really amazing with her great service and friendly and welcoming - her professionalism was also top notch. I never write reviews but had to. Thank you so much!
50,I had a great time in a luxurious room ate delicious food In wonderful restaurants enjoyed the most amazing views throughout Caesar‚Äôs property loved the amazing pools and had a great time gambling!
40,This resort is an icon of Las Vegas and I enjoyed our short stay there. The place is massive with so many dining options. The rooms are spotless and comfortable and special attention is paid to every detail. However check in was horrendous with many front desk agents replaced with self serve kiosks that are so slow it was unbearable. Also for the price of the resort fee the wifi barely worked in my room or didn't work at all. I called about it twice and was hung up on both times.
50,The room was great great view very clean bed was comfortable. Staff was the best in Vegas! Everybody was helpful and seemed like they were enjoying their job. Mini bar was pricey but that is expected. Would highly recommend.
50,From the moment of check in to to checkout the staff at Ceasars was wonderful and helpful. The room was very nice roomy and comfortable. The staff in the casino were okay could be more friendlier. The servers were friendly and present at all times.
40,I enjoyed the rooms in the Augusta tower. Sheets and bed were very comfortable. Staff was friendly and helpful and the restaurants inside the hotel were very good. Having a Starbucks near our tower was very convenient.
50,We loved our handicap accessible Augustus Tower room with a view of the Bellagio fountains. The on site Rod Stewart Show was awesome. We enjoyed dining at near by Gordon Ramseys restaurant. I liked the Beef Wellington. We liked Harrah s Piano Bar and Oyster Bar are just across the Strip as well as Margaritaville.
50,The room was outstanding with the best view of the Fountain. Housekeeping is great with extra towels water and coffee. Quick room service too! Diamond lounge is great and the pool is the best! Love Caesers Palace.
50,Our trip to Caesars was absolutely perfect! From start to finish we were blown away. The central location and breathtaking view made it such an amazing stay for us! Also such a great variety of restaurants and attractions made it more than worth the stay!
50,Love Caesars Palace a couple of issues I had but other than that it was great! Suite had a few problems need some upgrades. I love the location it is close to everywhere we go.I had an issue day before I checked out but it was corrected.
50,Had a great time staying at Caesars.  Great hospitality and good food. Can‚Äôt wait to go back in a few months. Only bad thing was going on the tour with Wyndham and couldn‚Äôt use the Voucher that was given for us to have dinner. No restaurant that was on the list would accept it. But other than that. I had a fabulous time.
50,The room we had over looked the Bellagio water show which my wife watched while sitting in a comfy chair. The property was well appointed. we ate at the Old Homestead Steak house which was excellent. We also dined at Nobu which was an experience in it self if you've never eaten at Nobu restaurant you might want to consider the one at Cesars.
50,The room are very clean and comfort  good location for walking on the strip  restaurants are having good food and a lot of choices  good buffer  I would recommend friend and family come for relax having fun on the weekend and Holidays 
50,Caesars is a beautiful hotel. The staff are very accommodating and very nice. The rooms are clean and very spacious. The location is perfect. Center strip. There are quite a few restaurants to choose from. We liked the cafe near the lobby. Great food but a little on the expensive side. Raos was also great.
40,Go to Vegas a few times a year and always try to stay somewhere new.Got a great rate from Caesars rewards so I gave the Palace a try.I was very pleased with most of the stay.    I have Diamond status so access to the VIP check in area erased any lines.Had to go a bit out of the way to get there.Should be close to the main check in but that's nit picky.Room was ready by 1 and got a text as promised.  King roomOctavious tower.Nice roomspacious and well appointed.Bathroom was incredible.Tower is a LONG walk from everything but the pool.Pool complex view.No strip views to speak of but the pool is a sight in of itself.Spent time there and it was very nice.    Casino is small for a large property but plenty of games.Pricey to gamble.Sunday night I found only finding $25 craps.Cheap gambling is a quick walk across to the Flamingo or Linq ($10 mins).Sports book was large and seemed nice but you can't get a seat on the weekend without reserving it.I tried to get a seat Friday for horse racing but the mgr blew me off.Told to sit in the 2nd row (it was already full).Got sick of waiting so I walked to Bally's.    Caesars has everything under one roof just be prepared to pay for it.The breakfast buffet is $59! It was good but not $59 good (my opinion).    The property was very nice the employees very friendly (race book aside I'm a low roller and expect to be treated as such sometimes) and it's location is perfect.I'd stay here again given a deal but would gamble and eat at other Caesars resorts.
50,We have never stayed in the Julius Tower and found the room and location to be great. We ate at Rao's and had a delicious Italian meal with great wine. Gambling options were always good except the crap tables were way to expense. Overall the trip was a success and a lot of fun at Caesars.
10,Couldn‚Äôt check-in until 4pm but we arrived by 7:30am... Didn‚Äôt get any maid service or fresh towels & was told it was my responsibility to call the request in... Was given option to have $10 taken off bill but was then told that cuz we didn‚Äôt charge food that the discount didn‚Äôt apply... Water pressure & hot water were unreliable... Can‚Äôt even open the mini fridge without getting charged $75... Resort fees are outrageous - $45+ per day... Multiple areas within casino & hotel smelled like sewage... Don‚Äôt recommend this place at all!
50,We didn‚Äôt stay at Caesars this trip but we attended a concert and spent time playing slots. The property atmosphere is fun and inviting. The rewards Caesars offers is worth spending time here. I recommend this location without hesitation.
50,My sister and I stayed here for 9 glorious days in mid September. Check in was top notch cannot praise Epilito enough (so sorry for the spelling; lost the card). We were early after a long flight and he got us checked in to a beautiful room in the Augustus tower. Rooms were like new each day; housekeeping was amazing. Restaurants were great; casino so much fun. Highly recommend
50,This was my first stay at Caesar‚Äôs and I loved it.. our room was super nice (suite 11th floor pool view). The bathroom was ridiculous.. two areas to get ready which worked well for a girls trip. Everything was clean.. and housekeeping did an amazing job everyday.    Everything about the place is over the top. We didn‚Äôt have a bad meal.. the pool area is super nice. The shopping is super nice.    You can go to Caesar‚Äôs.. gamble eat drink shop sleep have a fabulous time and never even leave the hotel.
50,Fabulous strip view room with super comfy king bed  In forum tower which is great location! Close to concert venue  Great restaurant choices & gaming  Awesome cocktail servers & bartenders sports book  Pools food court fabulous staff
20,The checkin person was not very friendly or helpful. I asked about the room and how the different towers compare and she wasn‚Äôt willing to explain much. The room we got was not impressive at all. We stayed at Bellagio last time in Vegas in a standard room and were wowed by the floor to ceiling windows and everything about it. This room at Caesars was outdated looking small window and the elevators had cracked glass on the inside. I will not stay at Caesars again unless some major efforts are made.
50,I recently traveled to Las Vegas for a one night stay. I chose to book a room at Caesars Palace due to its convenient location. Upon my arrival my first interaction was with the front desk staff. I interacted with Pete and Emma and received extraordinary service from them! Both were not only polite and nice but also cared about my stay and even offered great recommendations! Although this time it was a short stay Pete and Emma enhanced my experience and will certainly stay at Caesars again because of individuals like Pete and Emma!
10,On the first night during check-in I was assured that room service would be available and there would be no problem with fast service. When I called for room service I was told it would take 2 - 3 hours at 10:30 p.m. in the evening. In discussing this situation with the manager I was given multiple excuses. I really hoped they recorded the conversation because the manager said all the wrong things. My 78 year old father was with me so I had to walk him back down and through the casino (quite a hike) to get him some food. The next day he went to get a drink to swallow his pills and the glass he picked was broken all along the rim--and he would have been cut if he hadn't seen a sparkle on the rim just before drinking. I was told a manager would call me about these issues but that never happened. Given what I paid for the room--and how many other nice places there are in Las Vegas--my suggestion is to go elsewhere. Caesars is nice appearing on the outside but the rooms are pretty basic and not really any better than most 3 - 4 star hotels in the Vegas area. Also don't expect them to change your sheets during your stay unless you write them a note indicating you want your sheets changed. There are some good restaurants here but the cost for the rooms isn't worth staying here just for the restaurants. Just be prepared to be treated like a number not a customer. Also if you have a complaint be prepared to have management avoid dealing with the problem.
50,Our junior suite was extremely spacious. Having two bathrooms was an unexpected perk. We felt very spoiled. The whole property is extremely well taken care of. No dingy carpeting or paint chips like some other establishments.
30,Let me start by saying this is a excellent hotel. This review deals mainly with things that Caesars Palace needs to work on. Almost everything about this hotel is excellent but when you pay for the best you need receive the best and that is just not what is received. One can find a room here starting at $150/night when you include the resort fee and taxes but that is as cheap as it gets. No one goes to Vegas to sit in the room to watch TV but sometimes that all you want to do and at Caesar's it is very frustrating. All day and all night the signal is interrupted every 30-45 seconds and you loose picture and sound not acceptable when watching the news. Next in the halls of the Augustus and Octavius area of the hotel there is putrid odor/smell of fish that is not good at all. This really needs correcting smelling this for over a week was very disgusting. Now for the resort fee which is not isolated to Caesar's this is the exact same thing as car dealerships administration fee all it does is pad their bottom line. If guests were to get something in return for this $25 - $100 fee per night it would be different. One thing that the resort fee covers is WIFI or should I say the lack of. But to have to pay for WIFI that does not work is a travesty and illegal. Neither the WIFI or our provider could generate a signal strong enough to download a simple web page.
50,Caesars was beautiful! The room was awesome. Big and roomy with a gorgeous bathroom. The housekeeping was amazing. Everyone that I came into contact with had a professional and happy personality. They seemed to enjoy their jobs. And the food was TOO good. I think I gained 10 lbs!
40,I really enjoyed my stay at Caesars (with a friend who had a room). The only BIG downfall was the feather pillows everywhere! (Since i do enjoy breathing and not having swollen eyes and blisters) I was able to get replacement bed pillows from very friendly housekeeping.
50,The room service was wonderful. While there was a little bit of a wait in the check-in line for Platinum guests; I could tell that the staff was really trying to be as helpful as possible. The facilities at the hotel games and casino personal was exceptional. We enjoyed out stay very much.
50,We stayed in Las Vegas for five days at this Luxurious Destination. Check in and out was easy . The room was exceptional well kept clean and great to look at! The corridors were beautifully decorated and had an amazing feel. The food was amazing and there were so many restaurants! The pools and surrounding areas were beautiful. The waters were sparkling clean and clear. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable they helped us to find the locations we were looking for throughout the property. This is the number one hotel on the strip. We enjoyed our stay. When in Vegas stay at Ceasars Palace! It‚Äôs the place you will want to be!
50,Very nice hotel to stay . Their room is extremely clean bathrooms and bedrooms  full amenities staff very helpfull and accomodating . Very good table games and slots machine . Love their food of all kinds and concert rooms .
40,The room was very clean and it was nice. However it was a little beat up. The wood on the chest of drawers and the desk were scratched. Our sink leaked. I went to make sure I'd turned it off properly and the entire handle came off in my hand. I called for maintenance and was told 15 minutes. The water was off so ok. I could handle 15 minutes. Well it turned into well over an hour. We had reservations to go somewhere. I made my way downstairs to see the issue. I ended up getting my resort fee waived and a $50 comp to use for meals/drinks which was nice. My friends were staying at the hotel and booked their rooms at the same time through Southwest Vacations. They were put in different places in Caesars. Their rooms were much nicer/newer than mine. I would stay at Caesars again just not in the Towers.
50,My brother Martin and his wife Grace treated us! We had a great Night at Caesar's Palace! We started at Gordon Ramsey's Pub n Grill inside Caesar's. Staff were lovely! It was a pleasure but expensive drinks!  Then into the Colleseum to see Rod Stewart. What an amazing time we had! Rod did a great performance and his orchestra was incredible!
50,Things went wrong at Mandalay Bay during the check in and I was able to get a reservation that same day at Caesars. I am at the Diamond tier level and received amazing service at check in from Princess. She was able to get me into an amazing room for my 50 Birthday along with Christina Aguilera tickets. Such a memorable weekend!
30,"I have been coming to Las Vegas for a long time. Over 20 years. I have stayed in many places here and I think I am pretty learned on how this city and the casinos work. There are many good things about the Harrah's/Caesars properties. Some not so good.    Let's start with the good. Caesars is beautiful. It's iconic. Despite being over 50 years old it is well maintained (not always true for their other Vegas properties). This trip I was in the Augustus tower. The room was nice with a great view of the Bellagio fountain. Nice big shower great jacuzzi tub very comfortable bed. They have great restaurants. My only complaint about the food here is that if you don't want to spend a bunch of money your only option is the food court where I didn't love what I had (10 bucks for a very mediocre slice of pizza). However if you take a short walk through the forum shops Cheesecake Factory is a pretty decent place to eat for reasonable money. Around 20 bucks for an entr√©e and pretty quick and friendly service. I went 3 times on my 5 day trip. I found the regular chairs uncomfortable. The bar was great however if you don't have a big group.    Almost across the board I had great service from bartenders and cocktail waitresses at all the Caesars properties. If you take care of them they will take care of you. I usually do a couple bucks a drink. They appreciate it and will keep your drinks coming if that's your thing. If you aren't gambling the drinks are not cheap.    I have found that the Caesars properties do a much better job than the MGM properties when it comes to extending offers of rooms and promotions to the average joe like me. This trip for example I was here to play in a 150000$ freeroll poker tournament with free (except the resort fee) rooms for my 5 day stay. Upon registering for the tournament I found that I didn't like the way it was structured (very different from the last one I played) but they were still giving away a bunch of money (casino play). Pretty nice incentive. Of course they know that for every person they lure in with these sorts of promotions they have a good chance of getting pretty deep in your wallet!    Ok. Lets start with the Bad.    Resort Fee. Ok Caesars. You got me here I'm gambling in your casino. I've lost an average of 500 bucks a day to you for the last five days. Do you really need to gouge me for 45$ a night resort fee? Years ago this wasn't a thing. I don't know if it's the new pro sports teams coming to town getting subsidized or what but I find it uncalled for. I think diamond and above players don't pay it but you have to spend a lot of money at these places to get that status.    Paid parking. Are you serious right now? People drive however many miles to come be irresponsible at your blackjack tables slot machines etc and you are going to charge them to park? Why not include a free slap for every hand they lose?    Odds. Many people don't care too much about the odds. Some of us long time gamblers do though. One of my favorite games is video poker. Technically if you play correctly the casino will have a slight advantage in the long run but you aren't getting raked over the coals by the odds. That is unless you play on the strip lately. I haven't found a decent machine with good odds on a Caesars property on the strip in years. Some blackjack tables have even gone from paying a 3/2 blackjack to paying a 6/5 blackjack. If you don't realize how bad this is for the player you should look it up.    Mini bar. 7$ for a small water? In what world is that a thing? Most hotels that I have liked over the last few years provide a fridge for your use. I was informed that if you attempt to use the mini bar fridge for your own use it is a 75$ fee.    This last one really irks me. Apparently Caesars has implemented a new policy after the horrible atrocity with the shooter a couple years ago. If you opt out of having your room serviced while you are here they will send a person to do a ""Safety Check"" on your room every day. These people come into your room (whether you are present or not) to look around and make sure you are ""ok"". Really I think it's just an excuse to big brother people. Making sure your aren't planning anything nefarious. I find this an irritating interruption at best and an invasion of privacy at worst. I was awakened from a nap once and had just gotten out of the shower another time. I have to say that I don't like people I don't know potentially going through my stuff without me around. Ladies would you like a guy demanding access to your room to ""look around"" for your safety while you are alone? I wouldn't tolerate people coming to my house to do a ""safety check"" why would I pay caesars to do it while I'm on vacation??? I find this a very questionable policy and combined with my other problems with Caesars properties over the years I am considering looking elsewhere when my next vegas trip is being considered.    10/8/19 I wrote most of this review back in April while I was still in the hotel room. I sat on if for a while trying to decide if I was being too harsh on a brand that has been my favorite way to go to Vegas for years. Gave myself a ""cooling off"" period. I have decided to publish the review as I have reread it and still agree with everything I wrote. As a guest or customer at a hotel in Vegas I used to feel appreciated. These days the Caesars properties make me feel more like a suspect than a guest. My next Vegas destination is still up in the air."
30,It was ok not the best but not the worst    The room isn‚Äôt wasn‚Äôt what. We picked  We picked a king and we‚Äôre given a kingn  Pick another hotel If you wanna stay in Las Vegas  Won‚Äôt let me hit sending with out 200 words the worst
20,For what we paid for our room our first time stay at Caesar's was a huge disappointment. Started off poorly when the check in lines were so long. Casars you need to hire more employees. Poorly functioning kiosks didn't cut it for us and still had to stand in line. Understaffed and Poor service everywhere at check in at rewards desk at restaurants and sparse drink servers on casino floor. Our major issue however was the nickel and diming on everything.. No amenities. No coffee in room must pay a daily coffee service to use coffee pot in room. $75 fee to use room refrigerater. We agreed stupidly to a $10 food credit in lieu of maid service which we did not receive because we had stood in line so long that we didn't want to stand in line again to get coupon. So no maid service and no food credit. And then the room was shabby. Carpet was worn towels raggedy no robes or other amenities. Just such a big disappointment overall.
30,Caesars is no better nor worse than any other Las Vegas strip hotel. Like all the others Caesars charges a resort fee. They push the fact that they feature check in/check out kiosks.....but if you try to use it before 4pm it just tells you to come back later or they can send an email when your room is ready. At 5p got email.......but the line for the kiosk was longer than the counter...  The only real plus was the bookkeeping department that refunding a parking fee that I accidentally caused myself to pay double.
30,Bummer that Venus pool has changed its format no longer European adult pool the lounge chair arms were a dirty greasy brown and parts of the pool water had dirt or a slim floating around we still went in the water though the service pool side was good and the waitresses had new swimsuit uniforms the hotel it self is great and the restaurants were Spectacular and it‚Äôs always nice to shop at the forum
10,We arrived at 9 am to leave our bags at the hotel until check in and checked with the desk to see what time check in was. The front desk said we could get all the paperwork done and just pick up keys later and we agreed. They got our phone numbers to let us know when our rooms were ready but said if we did not hear from them by 1 pm to go ahead and come back which we did. Rooms not ready (our group had 3 rooms and we asked that they be on the same floor we didn't ask they be next to each other just the same floor} we ended up checking back several times since they were not ready at 4pm check in time or 5 or 6 not until 6:45 pm. We finally get to the rooms our room the power curtains doesn't work and there is a hole in the wall all of the furniture was old and mismatched and you had to be careful about opening the door to the little room for the toilet if the outer bathroom door was open or they would smack into each other. We said something about the curtains and were told you can still use it manually. I know that seems like a small thing but i found it irritating that they seemed to not care about fixing it. The other rooms for our group were not much better rusty shower heads etc. Then half the pools were closed. I always heard Caesars was so nice but it wasn't for us. I love the Venetian and will stay there instead! actually even TI is better and they are always pretty inexpensive.
10,I was over charged for parking $90 for 30min  My host did nothing to help me during my stay  Went to the host office I was rejected because according to them I didn‚Äôt play enough for them to help me the agent at the box office was rude and couldn‚Äôt give me a straight answer when to picked up my rod steward tickets  And to put ‚Äúthe cherry on top‚Äù they had the nerve to take 2000 points out of my total rewards card in order to cover my ‚ÄúCOMPLEMENTARY STAY‚Äù
50,Location was great rooms were roomy beds were comfortable. Bathroom was large and big enough for 2 with jets for significant other. Of course the pool was amazing and the food was great!! Fun casino
50,Great place to PLAY. Can't wait to stay there next time. Drinks were good. Table game's were popping. Casino was blinging. Lot's of thing's to DO. Dealer's were friendly and helpful to rules of the game's. Seen several jackpots in the couple of hour's I visited.
50,Many overhead signs provided information on where you might want to go in Caesar's Palace plus asking an employee was a good experience. They were very friendly and helpful--did not consider it an imposition. The Food Court provided several options in various choices and the food we selected was delicious. The concert experience was excellent--not too loud not too soft performance. The seating was very comfortable with adequate room for you.
40,Room was huge but a long walk to Ostavius tower. Would choose Agustus next time. Food was extremely expensive. Hell's Kitchen was fabulous and worth the cost. Absenth was hilarious but should come with a stronger warning about highly sexual language. Some people were offended.
40,We arrived about 11am and checked in. They were very good and one of our two rooms were available at that time which was helpful so we could unload our stuff. This is our fifth hotel we have stayed in whilst visiting Vegas. For me the room was outstanding nice lounge area and two bathrooms. We stayed in the 21st floor. View not great but room was. Did find their billing system slightly odd and took a bit of working out. One of their shops Caesars Activewear inside the hotel had an assistant called Evelyn. She was unbelievably good and helped us with a product to purchase unlike some of the other ladies in the shop. Having said all this the actual Caesars site is absolutely enormous. We managed to get some tickets to watch Rod Stewart which was great. My only real complaint is that they allow smoking in the complex. The constant smell and it getting into your clothes is not very nice. They also have smoking floors for customers. I felt as a non smoker we were punished for people who have a filthy habit and little consideration for others .
50,This has been the best experience we had in Vegas so far.  It started with the nicest suite we ever been to - it had an amazing bed room dining room and a living room.  But the room service we just fantastic - the food was great - and the customer support was just beyond our expectations. We did everything over text - even check-out...  When we needed more towels - I just texted the hotel and they sent them immediately.  Our view was mind blowing - the pools were warm and not busy - and we even got to try the famous Buffet  which was just super tasty in all aspects.  This hotel is not our #1 favorite in the Strip - after we really tried them all by now... so that says a lot !  We will definitely come back again :)
50,Shower knobs were a bit confusing and was hoping to have a bath tub. Mehret from FD was truly amazing. Very helpful and welcoming üëçüèºüëçüèº. Definitely coming back to Cesars. Highly would recommend to friends and family.
50,Our room was excellent.  The service was outstanding.  We enjoyed our stay so much at Caesars that we booked again for the following month. We also have plans for November and December with friends!!!!!
50,Always a good time great place to gamble stay and eat. I recommend it as a Vegas highlight. The Forum is great for shows the pool is one of best. Sports area is great place to watch football. Friendly enployees!
50,Everything was perfect ! Fantastic hotel very spacious room clean and with good restaurants inside and shops. Swimming pool area was absolutely great. good customer service everyone was very kind and polite. Really recommend!
50,From the moment we checked in I was treated so well. I'm a diamond member and had a beautiful suite in Augusta tower  Kristen at the front desk was amazing !!  Found drinks a little pricey at pool  but we had a great girls trip  thanks. Caesars palace !
20,"My husband and I had tickets to the Colliseum and a dinner reservation at Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen so staying at Caesars seemed like the thing to do. Although we have stayed at other properties in Vegas (The Venetian The Palazzo Mandalay Bay etc.) we had never stayed at Caesars before. Big mistake as it turned out. The hotel was completely unremarkable. The room was not particularly inviting. The bed was carelessly made and the top sheet had a stain on it. The pillows were some of the most uncomfortable and hardest that we have ever slept on. I had a stiff neck the next morning. We had brought a bottle of wine with us to sip on before our show. Unfortunately there were no wine glasses nor were there any glasses other than two miniscule ones in the bathroom which we ended up using but not before I had to wash them because they weren't clean. The furniture was some of the worst we have encountered in a hotel room. It was old scratched stained and shabby. There was a small sectional that had a layer of dust on it. There was a red satin throw pillow on it that had a stain on it. It looked as though the old chairs had been re-upholstered. Regardless we didn't find them to be particularly attractive. The bath towels were ""scratchy."" I am not sure what look they were going for with the room but in our view they didn't achieve it. In short we would never stay here again. The only reasons to come here as far as we are concerned are the Colliseum Hell's Kitchen Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill and the shops. Had a wonderful dinner at Hell's Kitchen and saw an amazing show at The Colliseum. It was just the hotel itself that was a disappointment. Such a shame because the rooms are a good size and they could have done so much more with them. To be fair the draperies were attractive as were the rest of the throw pillows on the sofa (just not the red satin on). Plenty of hot water in the shower and the toiletries were pleasant but that's about it. Based on photos I have seen of other rooms it appears the rooms are quite different so other guests may have had a better experience. Regardless based on the experience we had there is nothing ""palatial"" about Caesar's Palace. Highly overrated and not worth the money."
50,"We stayed four nights at Caesar's Palace in the heart of the Strip. The property was outstanding! The Suite was enjoyable 1050 square feet with a beautiful view of the Strip at night. The swimming pool area gave us a nice ""day time"" feature that kept us out of the casino's. The staff of Caesar's Palace was well trained and service was unbelievable! Pricey ... but well worth every penny."
50,Exceptional service great location on the strip clean and comfy rooms! Best place we've stayed in Vegas so far! We arrived early but had no problems with checkin or bell desk. Would highly recommend!
40,We didn't stay here but had the intention of nipping in to see the cheesecake factory. Well an hour later and we were totally lost. Great place but literally no exit signs!! Cannot believe how vast this place is absolutely amazing!
50,Excellent check in process using app and kiosk. I really didn't require any interaction with staff for check in or check out. No standing in line. The room was very nice and a good selection of games in the casino.
50,Rooms are very nice and spacious. Nice shower some rooms with a sauna. I like staying in the Julius Tower because it is the closest to the Casino. I love the Food Court where you can just grab a bite if you are not too hungry and don't want to sit in a restaurant and wait.
30,Furniture is old carpet is worn and faded. Put us in a room that smelled like a dog kennel and I am allergic. Reserved king bed room and was not told that it was not a guarantee. Really shocked about the whole experience. Mirage and Mandalay Bay are much better including their casinos.
40,We stayed in the Augusta suite and it was easy access to the strip the rooms were clean and spacious. The Bacchanal buffet was delicious and we enjoyed gambling in the casinos and walking through the Forum areas. Because my wife and I don't smoke I wish they had cleaner air inside otherwise everything was great.
40,Upscale hotel in Vegas. No reasonable priced place to eat. Rooms are nice. Slot machines really tight. No one getting jackpots the whole time we were there. Unless you have a ton of money to spend to elsewhere
50,We stayed for 6 days at Palace Tower newly renovated room with view at the pools. I asked for refrigerator and it was delivered. There is Keurig coffee machine there I would recommend to bring your own K-cups. Bathroom had 2 sinks jacuzzi separate shower and toilet room with. the door all in marble.. .Very nice! Definitely going to come back. Highly recommend.
50,We stayed at Caesars palace for one night on September 3rd. The room was spacious and quite and we could not here any outside noise. The Pools were fantastic and our kids loved them as my wife and I did . Overall it was a great stay at the hotel.
50,Caesars Palace has been good to us everytime we've gone to Las Vegas. Always a must go spot for us for shopping and gambling. Good food too. A lot of tables and quick drink services too.  We always play table games and slot machines.  We also usually shop at the Forum.
40,hotel is centrally located and within walking distance to other hotels and eateries and retail stores..Why must I have at least 200 characters in my review to post my answers? If you want my input don't put in rules that are not necessary.
30,Nobody helped me to check the area for my lost stuff a IV pole after I went home On Sept 30  I called caesars rewards center supervisor without help and left msg several times no response.  Also called lost and found several times also left msgs  no returning call either.    I have to get a new IV pole now.    I felt that if someone can check in front of caesars rewards center in time it should be very easy to find my IV pole.
50,Nice Room it was on 26th floor so I get Great View by looking down the Swimming pool and also you get to see the City ! Also it‚Äôs very Big Hotel so many Towers and I enjoyed walking to the other Towers also !!
50,We stayed in the Julius Tower. Rooms are nice and clean but could use a little updating. Staff is nice and friendly. The casino has a good atmosphere. If you go make sure to eat at the buffet.... it‚Äôs worth the price!
30,We had a suite and an adjoining room in the Forum Tower it was large but the furniture was in poor condition (nicks scratches smelled). There was a Keruig but no coffee pods without a huge cost!!! Enjoyed excellent food at Mesa Grill.
50,Everything was wonderful and all the service was wonderful everyday. I would have all my friends üë¨ could come alone and have fun with me!!! It‚Äôs a great place to have fun and great things to do and great service and don‚Äôt forget the food ü•ò is the best!!!
50,Beautiful attentive and accommodating staff best sports book  The diamond lounge is a one of a kind experience. The staff really makes each trip unique and memorable. Nobu IL Mulino and the homestead are absolutely delicious.  I‚Äôll only stay at Caesars when in Vegas!  A++++
50,We enjoyed our stay at Caesars in Las Vegas. The room was large and comfortable and was kept up by the daily staff. We also enjoyed our slot playing experience on the floor and hit a royal flush! Caesars also hs great swimming pools with a lot of room and pool access
50,We recently visited on a Saturday (8/28/2019) and it was packed even though there were 1000's of people and i thought it might be a chore to find a server we received very quick and friendly service from multiple employees.
50,We had a beautiful room in the Palace Tower with a great view of the pools. The amenities in the room were excellent and the bed was extremely comfortable. The local was perfect for the pool and central to the casinos.
50,From the minute I pulled up to the front I was greeted and they unloaded my luggage and told me where to go to check in this was my first time staying at Caesar's. I would highly recommend this hotel. The rooms are fabulous the employees are all friendly and very knowledgeable they answered all of my questions without hesitation. I am definitely coming back.
50,We have consistently been impressed with the service at Caesars. We enjoy the poker room and sports book. Dining at Mesa Grill and Rao's also a must. We enjoy the beautiful pools and October is a good month for weather.
50,Annie in Diamond Registration was most efficient and courteous in booking us into a beautiful room  with Bellagio view. We enjoyed seeing the architectures and statues as well as watching the Dancing Waters next door. She is definitely an asset to this hotel.
50,This was my first time staying at Caesers Palace and I enjoyed it so much! The staff was amazing and very helpful during our stay. We go to run into some celebs who also were staying here and that was a bonus for us! I will definately stay here again next summer!
50,Highly recommended! Staff was very nice and room suite was very clean! Employees were very nice and would ask you if you needed anything. I will definitely be back to stay for sure! In my opinion it is far by the best property to stay at if you come out to Las Vegas.
40,"It was fine love the Casino atmosphere good dining choices throughout the facilities. ""Carmine"" was very good; brought me back to my younger days in New York!.  Overall Customer Service was fine; However it fell short of a WOW experience. It felt perhaps as if at times they were understaffed.  The wife Loves the Forum Shoppes.  I will go back and visit next time we are in Vegas; we always do!"
30,The hotel is first class. However for $500/night our room was terrible. We have stayed at many of the major strip hotels and this was by far the worst room we had out of all of them.  The people who work at the hotel are very nice we had great customer service.
30,Good hotel but never change the towels or clean the rooms. If you are going to sleep only this is hotel is for you. The casinos are big you need a day to see all the hotel but smell a lot to cigar..
50,Rooms are beautiful newly renovated Palace Tower. Bit of a walk to get out to the Strip but Awesome nonetheless. Would recommend to anyone wanting a great getaway for everyday hectic life!! Will stay here next time.
30,Great experience but the room price is very high. With these high prices come no complementary benefits like water or coffee/tea. $8+ for a small bottle of water &16 for 4 coffee pads inside the room. Too much and I wonder why!
50,My room was in a central location of the casino. Easy to get to the casino food court and shops. My room was always cleaned by housemaids as soon as I stepped out the door. Very friendly maids. I enjoy staying at Caesars Palace when visiting Vegas. The best place to stay.
50,Awesome Place. Very clean casino area and we barely noticed the smoke. The restaurants we went to were very nice and the service was great. The sports book area is large and was always open with multiple tellers so the betting lines moved quickly.
50,"This review is actually for the Diamond Lounge at Caesars Palace. (You need to establish a page for the Diamond Lounge btw it is currently ""unclaimed "" on Yelp). We love Caesars as Locals we visit at least weekly to eat and drink at a restaurant or two and of course a little gambling. As the larger Hotel/Casinos are all similar in terms of glitz restaurants and plenty of slot machines it is important to offer your customers an incentive to visit one property over another. That incentive for us is the Diamond Lounge at Caesars Palace. It is a welcoming refuge from the sometimes overwhelming crowds of tourists allowing us a chance to visit and plan our next stop without having to shout to be heard. Our favorite Bartender Rick keeps us coming back time and time again as he is not only a welcome Professional but a valuable resource to utilize when deciding which restaurant at Caesars to try next or again. My wife and I have come to appreciate more and more the valuable insight that Rick has to offer and consider him to be a friend. We spent a lot of hard-earned money to achieve Diamond status earning us some pretty sweet benefits at Caesars. The most important benefit to us is access to the Diamond Lounge."
50,Loved the ability to text our concierge and get immediate responses of any questions or needs. Caesars is huge but signage is very helpful. Prices are higher at Caesars then Other places on the strip.
50,Rooms were very nice clean & the View from the window was Great. I would recommend the hotel  to everyone because of location and friendly service we received. Restaurants we eat at were very  nice we ate the Palms Mesa Grill & Steak house in Caesars.
30,"Although one of the largest on the strip I was less than impressed. Hot and cold spots throughout the casino and a less than adequate smoke removal system. Was approached twice in my room for an ""inspection"" due to the shooting two years ago. Management wanted to inspect since we declined maid service. Security....okay.....but kinda weird. High table limits on Blackjack with mediocre drink service. Again nothing terrible but definitely not THE trip we were hoping for. Thank God that Rod Stewart still puts on a good show."
40,Good experience room nice and clean food expensive.Price of everything in Vegas keeps increasing at some places absurdly so. The property of Caesers is very nice the gym is good the pool area is beautiful but expensive. A Chaobani yogurt in the gift shop cost $4.50 for example.
50,The hotel was beautiful. Good choice of restaurants and swimming pools to choose from. Table games could have been a little lower. Security was very helpful when I lost my phone. Would love to stay there again!
50,Always an amazing time at Caesars properties. Gorgeous pool and unbelievably detailed architecture. Highly recommend Trevi Italian restaurant for the views. Palace Tower had a nice poolside view and the rooms were very clean and updated.
10,We booked 2 nights at CAESARS PALACE for Rise festival. My girlfriends and I splurged on our room because - treat yourself. At 9:30pm the night before our reservation I get a call from Ceasar's unapologetically telling me that they've overbooked their hotel and they've moved us to the Flamingo and crediting the money. These two hotels are not comparable in hotels and the new room was not the same suite as our one at Ceasar's. They didn't care they weren't sorry and because they called so late that didn't even give us a chance to even try and find another room that we wanted. Ceasar's wouldn't even talk to me they transferred my call to the other hotel they took no ownership of their mistake.
50,If you have been dreaming about visiting Las Vegas and enjoying the best look no further. Caesars Palace is a beautiful property. First class all the way. Great food gaming and shows. You never have to leave the property.
50,I was in Las Vegas with my sister from 10/2/2019 thru 10/6/2019. We stayed at Caesars Palace courtesy of Foxwoods Casino. We were checked in by Tangela and she was professional friendly and very informative. She made the check in process enjoyable. She was very efficient and provided us with all of the necessary info we needed to check in check out room service and resort amenities. We will definitely look for her on our next trip to Caesars Palace.
50,great room all around great experience hope to be doing it again next year for sure.  good looking women everywhere. Food was awesome no matter which restaurant you ate at. service was top notch and very friendly people. looking forward to next year
40,Hotel still up to standards. Despite financial issues property is still well kept and customer service is given priority. Plenty of dining options. Slots are above average in winning oercentage. Newest slots are available.
50,We always have the best time at this resort my wife love it my daughter love it to she like shopping and the restauran I love gambling and my wife to we love cause the pool are incredible employees the best great crevice we recommend to are family and Frend to
50,The room and all amenities were very clean and nice. I really like the sports book the  seating is great and the service was prompt. We ate at several restaurants and had a  good experience in the all. The overall service was great.
30,"First off I've been to Vegas many times. I've stayed at just about all your main strip resorts. This trip I chose Caesars because my wife and daughter haven't stayed there.    Check In- checked in@ Diamond registration was easy.    Suite- Julius Suite (387)-elevators are dirty and are in need of major upgrades. The room itself was fine. The view was terrible. I also think it's terribly ridiculous that the mini fridge and snacks are weight sensitive. I had to be cognizant every time I was around it to avoid not being charged inadvertently. As others have stated not having a coffee or water available without being charged $5 is completely crazy.    Housekeeping- didn't clean our room one of the days. We made them aware of it.    Internet- allows only 2 devices otherwise $14.99 charge. Another asinine charge/policy. We used 1 device. The wifi isn't very good anyway. I suggest checking your folio occasionally to make sure there aren't erroneous charges. There were charges made to our room that we didn't make. I called to the front desk and they were promptly removed. I just wonder how they got there. There were also internet charges that had to be removed. I shouldn't have to worry about stuff like this and Caesars needs to do a better job in avoiding these issues.    The hallways smelled of weed everywhere. Hard to avoid that these days but just be warned.    THE CASINO-    The workers excelled in the casino. Specifically (Jesse Mike and Ron) from the ""craps"" table were excellent. They were helpful in every aspect of the game. If it weren't for them this would have been a completely negative review. They should be acknowledged for their personalities assistance and joy for doing their job. Great job guys.    One thing about the casino as opposed to all other casinos is the table minimums. Most tables had $50 minimums with black jack. Craps table mainly had $25 minimums. The Bellagio the Wynn and the Venetian had better table minimums for higher end resorts. Ironically Caesars casino was the most lively....and smokey. The ventilation is terrible.    Pool- The pool was very nice. I enjoyed the swim up black jack. All the employees we encountered were very nice. Loungers were difficult to find. There were plenty of day beds for rent that took up a large amount of space. A revenue generator that wasn't generating much of anything.    Since I do most of my gaming with Caesars I will continue to stay at their properties. I will however look at other resorts more closely in the future."
40,Our room the pool area and the casino were all so beautiful. Clean and didn't smell like smoke at all. I wish there were complimentary waters offered at the hotel though- the ones in the mini bar are $6 each! The bars and shops are $$$$. The Alto Bar DJ and waitresses were top notch!
50,Tangela at the registration desk was very kind and really efficient. The Palace tower was beautiful and housekeeping took very good care of us. She was amazing. This is where I want to stay when I return!
50,It was my first time at Caesar‚Äôs Palace. I had an incredible experience mainly because of Tomek. I arrived at 1PM and was able to check in 3 hours earlier all because of him! He helped save us a lot of time and I couldn‚Äôt have been more thankful! He gave us a $10 voucher if we choose to not have housekeeping clean our room in the morning which I thought was an excellent deal. He was so pleasant to talk to and overall an incredible worker! You can also text housekeeping for extra things if needed and check out through your phone to skip the line. Will definitely come back again next time!
10,"The value at Caesars is extremely poor. Rates are very high for a sub standard hotel experience.  Signage is poor. Navigating the facility is difficult without clear maps or directions.  Food options are poor and overpriced.  Cleanliness is lacking across the whole facility.    I noticed blood on the wall in my shower.    For medical needs a fridge apparently can be provided however they do not tell you this until they put a $75 charge on your bill for putting anything much less opening the ""minibar"" fridge in the room.    Jose (I believe) Chavez a manager at the front desk lacks professionalism or courtesy when I tried to discuss this unnecessary charge and explain my medical need. He tried to claim a ""recalibration"" is necessary and was unwilling to remove the charge. They claim there is a sign on the front door but it is not visible due to poor lighting the Minibar is inside a cabinet and it is dim.    Some how solicitors were allowed to put flyers under my door daily. This is inappropriate.    I will not be staying here again. There is too much headache involved in this stay for it to be worth the ghastly rates. I will make sure I share my experience with friends family and others in my professional network also here for this conference totalling 1600 professionals.    Unacceptable experience."
50,Stayed at Cesar Palace and saw Rod Stewart! Oth of these were in my best friend‚Äôs bucket list and we did both! Someone at Cesar‚Äôs was amazing and made the decision to upgrade us to a SUITE!!!! Was on the corner and overlooked Cromwell and Belagio fountains ! Incredible! Gordon Ramsay‚Äôs Pub didn‚Äôt disappoint and was as delicious as ever. Super loved the speedy checkin and checkout. Was bummed that I double-paid for parking somehow so I still have to figure that out tomorrow. Fantastic stay. A wonderful man at the Bell Desk helped us walk all of our stuff to the self parking. Thank YOU!! Great trip !
50,Wow we were so impressed with our beautiful spacious room and spectacular view... at a cost of much less than we paid in every other hotel we had stayed in on our 3 plus week visit. We will be back. Thank you!!
50,I had a very difficult problem that was very stressful for me. Shawn Sparta not only solve my issue he went above and beyond. His level of customer service is excellent and he had wonderful people skills. I am so grateful that the people working at the rewards counter actually care about the customers and go out of their way to help. Thank you so much Shawn and Caesars for the great customer care.
50,Great view of the stripe Clean Hotel Nice friendly people .fabulous location. Location was great because I was able to walk to many exciting exhibits. So much to do and many shops to go shopping at. Many different Restaurants to choose from. Hell's Kitchen is in the walking distance which was very exciting. We also went to the pool area and it was lovely. I can't say enough about Caesar's Palace. Thank you Councilwomen Rose Mary Christian
50,Stayed in Augustus Tower room overlooking the Bellagio fountains for our honeymoon. I could have looked out that window for hours- beautiful!!!! The room was clean and well maintained. Big jacuzzi tub so we could relax shower had great pressure. The only thing I would subtract a half a point for is the squishy pillows. Too soft for me.  Pool was beautiful and warm just be ready to spend a lot on the drinks but hey youre in Vegas.  Will def. stay again everytime I come to Vegas.
40,Loved casino even though I didn't win much. Nice ambiance and decor with lots of Roman statues. Worth going to just to stroll through the beautiful hotel and casino and the adjacent designer shops. Be prepared to spend some money.
10,Quality of the room was not worth the cost. Our wifi didn't work the tv had technical issues and there was not even a refrigerator provided like at a motel 8 unless you wanted to purchase what was in it. If your expecting the caesars palace from the movies don't ! It was old run down and lacked good service . It's a hotel still living off it's reputation from the frank Sinatra days which like him is long gone. You're better off staying at a new modern hotel  whose service rooms and toiletries are up to todays standard.
50,We came to Caesars Palace just for one night and I cannot believe how incredible this property is! Thank you to front desk team: Emma Elpidio and Bello for an easy and awesome check-in. Their hotel manager Ayesha was courteous enough to give us an upgrade to a suite! Qua Spa was a great spot to ease away the stress - definitely recommended. We also enjoyed our time at the pool and restaurants. Will for sure come back to Caesars again!
30,Like most people myself and my husband travelled from LA (which we loved) on to Vegas. Everyone said you need to be on the strip and after looking at reviews Caesar‚Äôs looked like the best place to stay.    I must admit the strip wasn‚Äôt really our scene anyway. Crazy atmosphere but it did get annoying every time you leave the hotel having timeshare people half naked people etc trying to come up to you. So hopefully this isn‚Äôt taunting my view of the hotel itself.    It just felt average. From the mini bar that you can‚Äôt touch (otherwise it charges you even if you haven‚Äôt used it). To WiFi only allowed on two devices. If you try to swap devices you will be charged. To the fact it‚Äôs so big the restaurants in the hotel won‚Äôt charge to your room it‚Äôs all separate. Also Starbucks 18 dollars for two lattes I mean really?? It makes London look so cheap!!    The room was gorgeous very clean and we paid extra for view of the strip which was outstanding. We could see the Bellagio fountains from our room. And compared to other hotels on the strip it is the most grand.    The only other comment it felt dated there was a cigar bar in the hotel and walking in you could smell the lingering smell of cigarette smoke which I found little unpleasant. For Vegas it was nice and maybe it‚Äôs just how it is in Vegas a lot of money for not a lot.
50,Keli at the check in desk was absolutely amazing! She helped me with everything and went above and beyond to make sure everything during my stay has been perfect. I hope everyone at Caesars is as great as she's been!
50,Just returned from Las Vegas for a trip to see Donny and Marie. We selected Caesar‚Äôs due to its location mid Strip. After staying there we were happy with our choice. The resort is gigantic but it has everything from restaurants lounges and shopping.    We stayed in the Octavius Tower in a room with two queen beds. The room was large and spacious and the beds comfortable. We had a great view of the pool. The bathroom was also large with a separate shower and jacuzzi tub. After all the walking in Vegas it was great to have a good night‚Äôs sleep in a comfortable bed.    I loved the look of the Cleopatra Barge where we saw Wayne Newton. It felt like classic Vegas. Also we had drinks at Vanderpump‚Äôs Garden which was decorated beautifully. The cocktails were also pretty and delicious.    We had a great stay at Caesar‚Äôs Palace.
50,Loved our room overlooking the Bellagio Fountain...fantastic Rod Stewart complimentary seats...also saw Wayne Newton put on a great show at Cleopatra's Barge ! Great heated pools ! Gordon Ramsay's restaurants are great and give fast friendly service...check in and checkout smooth !
50,Check in line was quick and the person helping us gave us an upgrade with a late checkout! The hotel is beautiful and our room was too.That being said....there is a keurig coffee machine but they charge for coffee pods. Also Beware of the refrigerator and snack charges ! You can view your room charges on the tv so check it daily! They charged us for the water $9 and we didn‚Äôt touch a thing. We wanted to use the fridge and asked them to take everything out and they said no but would bring in a fridge for $20 a day. It‚Äôs a silly policy. But We would totally stay her again!
50,Nice room great restaurant options good customer service perfect weather fun time had by all.  Check and check out went flawlessly. Several satisfying meals and happy hours in the hotel and the Forum Shops.
50,The hotel is close to a lot of interseting things to do on the strip. The room was spacious and very quiet. There were plenty of food options within the hotel area including its namesake restaurant which was amazing.
50,Absolutely stunning. We used the kiosks to check in early. Super easy and it gave us the room key right then and there. Our room was beautiful clean and had a great view of the pool. I really don‚Äôt think you could get a bad view at Caesars. We unpacked and rested a minute then wanted to have an early dinner. Made our way to Masa ate then explored the palace.  My only complaint but (not a deal breaker) is that this place is ginormous so it takes forever to get where you going and a lot of walking. I would most definitely stay here again.
50,This is a great resort super large in size with it's shops and food restaurants besides it's gaming casino area and pools. Quiet busy with guest but a feeling of security there. Staff is well trained and professional with great customer service.
50,On my last visit to Caesars Palace I had the privilege to check in at VIP with Wilfred. Caesars is lucky to have such an impressive young man working for them. His process for check in was flawless. His social ability was so refreshing. I come to Caesars to relax and Wilfred got the trip off to a fabulous start. Wilfred even helped with a small issue of my key not working. What was great about that is he knew who I was by name when I walked in the room. Thank you Wilfred for being great at your job and I look forward to coming back soon.
40,"Still a great place to stay! Good food polite dealers and the best spa in Vegas. Craps tables are plentiful here and they lower their minimums to $15 or sometimes even $10 on weekdays but they change it up based on occupancy and the amount of action they're getting. The Beijing Noodle is pretty darn good and sonis the buffet despite a few issues. Gordon Ramsay's Pub is always a treat they make an excellent Bloddy Marry but the service at the pub is lacking a bit. However in Gordon's defense the food is always on point there. The artic snow machine @ the spa has been broken for quite some time now as it was not working both times I've visited over the past few months. They need to keep up with their maintenance more dilligently at the spa. Also they're using a cheaper cleaning agent when they mop the marble hallways these days and it smells like puke. Attention STAFF customers should not be subjected to that smell at Caesar's palace. Please look into other cleaning solutions that don't smell like human barf. Also their pillows feel much cheaper than they use to it's almost as if the feathers are constantly poking you!! The toilet paper is of much lower quality than it use to be to boot. The buffet is still good but I feel they use to make way better deserts specifically the chocolate souffle was always fresh and hot and the melted chocolate would spew out of the souffle like a waterfall. The souffles these days are typically cold and hard (rock like). A few years backthey made sure to replace old and stale trays of food more frequently and paid more attention to those particular details. Caesar's Palace is 50 years old and it shows. The Palace tower hallways have been trashed and the guys that painted over the scratches on the walls in the hallways did a terrible job. Stay in Octavius or Agustus because the rooms are in great locations and typically come standard with a jetted jaccuzzi tub and great views of the Bellagio Fountain! If you can't get those at a decent rate then try for the Palace tower as those rooms were recently updated and feel more premium than the Julius tower and much nicer than the old Forum tower. They still employ excellent talent their dealers and bellmen are first class and the valet team is pretty cool too! Very quick curteous and respectful with your luggage! There was one other issue upon checkout. I left a cash deposit with the hotel and they gave me a hard time about giving the cash back upon check out and it took extremely long to procure which I thought was very odd. With the rewards rates they offer it's hard to say no but I wish the management would really fix some of the property maintenance issues and pay more attention to quality control on several differnt fronts because this place has the potential to provide a superior experience for their customers. Caesar's use to be the best place to stay on the strip now it's just ""plain good."""
50,First time at hotel for 5 nights (previously stayed at Bellagio).  Gorgeous room upgraded for free hotel is out of this world massive with huge casinos and restaurants etc.  Pool area is lovely - the fountain pool was freezing and so cold no one could go in it but the others were pleasant temperature. No parasols for shade by pool area but this seems standard in US hotels.  Central location on strip.  Visited all hotels and this is amongst the best.
50,As the CEO of Valeau Photography in Las Vegas for a photo shoot Caesars Palace addressed my every need. They were welcoming courteous and full of information. They will be my home stay when I visit Las Vegas
50,I play poker and slots regularly at this number one property in the Caesars domain. Staff I encounter are always polite and helpful. Facilities except for some parking lot elevator glitches are consistently clean and inviting.
50,We loved to be empresses and enjoyed our stay at Caesars Palace. We got an upgrade to a Palace Tower Room and it was an awesome huge room with a marble bathroom. The Poolarea was so nice and it looks like you are in a pool in rome. The casino and the forum shops are also perfecly styled. The Caesars is best located at the strip. We want to came back right now. Thank you for letting us feeling like an empress :)
10,We have been to Vegas many times and there are so many great places to stay Caesars Palace isn't one of them! When we arrived we were not given the room we had reserved a king jr. suite despite having made the reservation months in advance which ok the hotel was packed with people we were given 2 queens which wasn't my husband and I's preference for my birthday weekend get away but had that been the only issue would have been no big deal. The A/C in the room didn't work and it took over an hour for someone to come check it. By the time they got there it was after 1am we were exhausted and my hubs had to a conference meeting at 7am. So we just dealt with the very warm uncomfortable room for the night. Went to discuss the issue with the front desk manager Jose' who was quite smug and said the room we reserved just wasn't going to happen and he the best he could do to accommodate us for a miserable first night was a $50 meal voucher on a limited list of restaurants.This sounds like a good deal until you realize the restaurants included a meal is $70+. As far as amenities go there aren't any unless you want to pay an arm and leg for even a cup of coffee in your room. Even Holiday Inn gives you free coffee/tea! The sheets are scratchy and overall just not the quality you would expect for the cost of the room! Also all casinos have smoke odor (except the oriental its nonsmoking) but I don't know if their ventilation system isn't working properly but it was overwhelming and awful on the casino floor! We will stay at the Oriental or MGM from now on!!
30,breakfast buffet had outragious prices forty dollars for breakfast that truth be told was worth maybe 10.  shops were not friendly and not truthful on prices but the inside was nice and good place to party
10,I make a reservation w/ hoteles.com 3 weeks before. When I arrive to the hotel and make. 25 min line  the attendant tell me the was a chance of hotel because the have a convention  And the send me to a cheep hotel smaller etc . I paid the room at caesars at the price the tell me to do it  and I check the other one and was Lower price  of course.  I call hoteles.com and the says that caesars was full and they move me and my wife . We were celebrating 10 years of marriage  I will never gonna be back again  Terrible experience
50,I love my room I was in the Augusta tower overlooking the Bellagio water show yeah it was beautiful experience I would like to say anyone out there if you wanna experience Vegas you would have to try and stay at Caesars. they make you feel welcome. Aloha.
50,Great clean casino fun entertainment great time at Hell's Kitchen restaurant great food and staff. Always have a wonderful time had a fantastic birthday getaway. Husband had a great time as well. Must visit
20,They emailed me an express check in option which allows you to skip the line and pick up the keys from a kiosk so I thought ‚ÄúGreat!‚Äù. Wrong! The kiosk upon checking in tells you the room is being prepared and gives you an option to be emailed or come back later so I chose the email and walked around ate. After 30 minutes of no email I went back to the kiosk and tried one more time gave me the same options. I waited for another 30 minutes when I thought maybe lining up will be faster so I did. While in queue we noticed that some of the receptionists would accommodate customers who skipped the line (not once maybe 3-4x in a 30 minute period). When I got my chance and asked about the kiosk apparently that wasn‚Äôt working because room reservations were loaded. Can you imagine if I waited for that email?! And mind you NONE of the 10 staffs in that registration area told ANY of the customers using those kiosks that those were not working! I‚Äôm giving 2 pts bc I like the aesthetics of the whole property specially the pool area which is the view from my room and the bed is comfy but the pillows seriously need to be updated.
40,I love staying at Caesar's Palace when I come to Vegas. Everything is always at it's best from the restaurants to housekeeping. And the staff has always been very friendly. My only real complaint lies with the spa. My first visit to the spa I opted to do a day pass to try it out and unfortunately the roman baths were down for a bit which is no big deal. Things break---totally understandable. The staff there on Thursday was super friendly and had told me they are open until 8pm and since I couldn't extend my stay for the night I could spend the early evening there until I had to leave for the airport. I was required to check out on Friday and when I went to go for a day pass the staff refused to give me the hotel guest price because I had already checked out. They then tried to blame the front desk staff for not informing me that I was not able to receive the guest rate. However when I told them it was the spa staff they demanded I name names. I'm sorry but i stayed a week at caesars at $45 a day for a resort fee they should have still honored the guest rate. If we are aloud to utilize the pool after check out why wouldn't we be allowed the hotel guest rate at the spa. I still really like Caesars but I doubt I'll be using the spa anytime soon. Thankfully there are other spas nearby.
20,I have been given a room at 4th floor beside ice machine very noisy my request to change it was declined!the reception should have been more helpful!  I had to check out and go to the Westin!i don‚Äôt recommend the hotel if you are coming for a conference or if you are flying long way! But definitely you will enjoy if you prefer this type of super crowded noisy hotel.
40,Stayed in Octavius tower 64th floor. Long walk to Las Vegas Blvd and parking garage. Hotel personnel super!!! Room a little dirty. Carpets and drapes needed cleaning. Bathroom shower head keep falling down. Repair personnel fixed it partially but it still did not stay in place. But we got a good rate so that's why we stayed here. Also the public areas were very clean and well keep. Would stay here again after checking room carefully before unpacking.
50,Quick room service. Room was clean every time we came back from breakfast. Order towels over the phone and we receive them quick. Had a wonderful time wld very very nice place to stay for week food was very good.
30,Room was dirty I book a king bed got twin beds was willing pay 300.00 for late check out couldn't or wouldn't try to accommodate me. It's at best a 4 star hotel . I did enjoy up close and personal with Wayne Newton .
10,We had to request towels each day. When towels were brought they did not take used towels. Left towels shampoo and soap on side of tub and toilet paper on the floor. The trash wss not emptied the three days we were there and stuffed full. I wanted to treat my daughters to a nice trip to Vegas and I was embarrassed by the room service.  I have stayed in Vegas over a hundred times and have never had such a horrible experience.
50,It's a very beautiful place so many shops all the brands are there the casino is amazing smiley faces everywhere rooms are luxurious the pool is nice so many shows and activities and most of all a lot of top restaurants!!
30,Loved Ruth at reservations Maria at front desk and Amir the bellman. Awesome experience with them. Beautiful room in Augustas Tower. Sink was stopped up throughout stay. Jacuzzi tub did not work. No complimentary coffee in room. Drinks at pool are excessive. Bacchanal Buffett has many selections but is overrated and expensive. Was 45 Anniversary and people at hotel knew but there was no complimentary amenity. People do not dress in a classy manner anymore. The least expensive table games are $15 minimum bet. Food court was also excessively priced. $10 for a piece of pizza? Service is excellent and atmosphere is opulent. No values or amenities like the old days. To many other options
30,Came for a business conference of which this hotel is the host. First time staying here but the check in service was poor. I paid for one night and my employer paid for the rest. When asked if I could stay in the same room I was said that I had to check out and then check in again and that if I wanted an early check in it was extra.
50,This is a review strictly on the POKER ROOM. (Visits 1/4/19-1/5/19 and 9/26/19-9/29/19)    We come to Vegas two to three times a year and hit the poker tables pretty hard. Usually we stay at MLife properties but it was all Total Rewards this trip. This was due to the service we received at the Caesars poker room in January. The location of Caesars is prime since Bellagio's room is a hop skip and a jump over a ped bridge and through the north entrance of the Bellagio designer shops.    Before I get into the good let me get one thing out of the way: The cocktail server is one of the hardest working people in the room. Please get them some help. I'm not going to ding Caesars in the star-rating since I previously saw efficient service in January but this weekend there seemed to be one server at a time. Separately they both were overwhelmed and consequently taking abuse by some of the crankier patrons. Just get them an extra set of hands Caesars.    Moving on.    Back to poker. The Venetian and the Orleans have been on heavy rotation in the last 5 years due to the variance in skill level the spaciousness of the rooms minimal wait times tournaments (Venetian) and promotions (Orleans). For this trip we stayed more mid-Strip clocking hours at both the Aria and Bellagio along with Caesars. And as within January Caesars took the prize and ran as the best all-around.    I clocked around 16 hours at Caesars Thursday (11 PM-4 AM) Friday (4 PM-7 PM) and Saturday (6 PM-2 AM). I rank Caesars as the best all-around of the three because the staff just does a great job here. There‚Äôs also a great mix of regs tourists and conventioneers. I think the room draws a good mix because it doesn‚Äôt shy away from location. While Caesars is in the center of the action across from Bobby Flay‚Äôs Mesa sportsbook and Omnia night club; other rooms tend to be pushed into corners behind slots near the bathroom. The location is kind of a wide net approach allowing the openness to allow for the curious passerby to give it a go.    What sets this place apart from anywhere else I play in Las Vegas is the Floor. This was both true in January and in October. This trip I mostly dealt with Jennifer (also James or Jason?). She was hyper-focused on customer experience from getting players into games quickly with a chip runner (or chip running herself) walking players to their seat quickly resolving seat changes running the nightly and anticipating table break-ups. I even saw her checking in on her server and clearing empties left around the room. Other than the admin stuff she is super personable remembering faces and preferred stakes. A standout you have there Caesars.    Dealers were once again top-notch. Another big shout-out to Pang (and I think Anthony?) and from January trip to Christian and Jeff. All-around the dealers don‚Äôt get caught up in too much talk with the locals ‚Äì which happens EVERYWHERE. Honestly they do a great job of balancing any talk with everyone at the table and manage to keep the game moving efficiently. They also have more to deal with in terms of player knowledge and etiquette in my opinion due to the player mix. They do a great job at warning players pro-actively. I had a few instances where players talked about hands when they folded out and exposing cards ‚Äì all nipped in the bud quickly as it should be.    Another great experience.
50,we stayed at augustus tower with bellagio fountain and strip view. this place has so much to offer from shows food and slots/table games that will fit your desire. very clean place employees are all nice except for this one incident at starbucks (marian‚Äôs her name between 10-10:30 am) were my daughters are trying to get their breakfast and charging it to our room while i‚Äôm still sleeping but to be fair to her she did say it‚Äôs a company policy that if they‚Äôre not listed in the room i have to be there to do the transaction then she say to my kids go get me and just cut the line and see her but when i went down she wasn‚Äôt there and did not endorse the situation to her co-workers so i stood in the diamond/7star lane feeling so sleepy so finally upon putting our order she showed up and the look in her face i can tell she‚Äôs not pleasured to serve a guest which is of her own nationality. well it‚Äôs a good thing that caesar‚Äôs palace has another starbucks by the food court which we do our business or just go outside. that didn‚Äôt ruin the staycation majority of the guest are employees taking a break from work so respect and treat everybody nice/equally. but all in all experience was 10/10 and would highly recommend to my friends and family
50,My husband and I try to come to Vegas at least once a year...and we always have a good time at Caesars. The atmosphere is always upbeat and friendly. The workers are always pleasant and eager to help.
50,Overall good but some minor problemsLike the room was too far away for me to go at night to the casino and my foot getting hurtI don‚Äôt know what you want me to say it‚Äôs giving me trouble to submit itThank you that‚Äôs all I have to say
50,Caesars always a comfortable stay with very nice rooms great location on the strip and excellent dining opotions. Forum Shops are incredible. Table games not the luckiest around and drinks are far more than other casinos hiwever always a great experience win or lose.
50,My wife & I took a short trip to Las Vegas. We stayed at Caesars Palace. The staff are more then helpful. Their are so many dinning options at Caesars. My wife & I spent the day by the pool & enjoyed our day. We believe Caesars has the best pools in Las Vegas.
50,Employees were great as well as the amenities. There was so much to do at we just didn't have time to visit everything. The casino was very clean with many of the slot machines that I enjoy. Didn't have to wait long for drinks while playing the slots
50,Location service food options atmosphere... it‚Äôs a great place to unwind for a few days. The fact that you stay in contact via text with your concierge is great you are also in walking distance from the heart of the strip.
20,The hotel is beautiful and the rooms were clean. We had a reservation for a king room but when we checked in we were told there were none available and that the mention of a king room in the reservation was just a ‚Äúsuggestion‚Äù. The registration attendant pointed out that although the double room they were giving us was more expensive they weren‚Äôt going to charge us extra. Yeah thanks. Our reservation also said it would be a recently remodeled room but I would love to know how they define ‚Äúrecent‚Äù as the furniture was quite scratched and nicked and the bathroom door had damage. Perhaps that was also a suggestion? On our first arrival to our hotel room the air was stale and very warm because the air conditioning wasn‚Äôt on. It took a while to get the room to a comfortable temperature. One concierge was very courteous and helpful and another was an argumentative jerk- we made our own reservations after giving up on him. Most employees we encountered (except the cleaning staff who were all wonderful) had a ‚Äútake it or leave it‚Äù attitude and didn‚Äôt seem very motivated by the idea of customer service. Next time we‚Äôll try another hotel.
50,Absolutely one of the greatest hotel / casinos to visit during any stay in Vegas! You'll be blown away by the beauty of the site and the amazing employees that work there. Also experience the restaurants and amazing shopping while there.
50,Arrived at Caesars greeted me the room was on the 13th floor which is not really my thing but I figure no problem in my Julius Tower up to my beautiful room unpack and I am READY TO PARTY!!!!!!!    Went downstairs proceeded to play oh dear it is a losing session one of many. Oh well went to Rewards desk got my voucher to Box office for my comp ticket for Wayne Newton ‚Äìoh yeah third time to see him!!! Now he is in the Cleopatra Barge which I personally do not feel it lends itself to concerts. Why they moved the show from Bally‚Äôs showroom to the Barge is beyond me. The showroom at Bally‚Äôs is awesome!! But I still love my Wayne Newton what an incredible entertainer!! Of course enjoyed the show and then went to The Caf√© for bite to eat.    Caesars always takes care of me it is one incredible resort and I love them all. My Birthday was so very special and one memory I will have for a long time to come!!!!!
10,So maybe I‚Äôm not rich enough to be a Caesars regular but my sister and I chose Caesars for our mother‚Äôs 75th birthday trip to give her a big treat since she loves Vegas. But the restaurants were overpriced we were only allowed 2 devices per day on the WiFi the pools closed early for a private party we had to call housekeeping twice for enough to towels and they even charged for coffee in the room.    I was not impressed by my experience at this ‚Äúnice‚Äù hotel and casino.
50,Situated at the heart of the Vegas strip like the Forum in Rome Caesar's brings the elegance of antiquity into the modern display of architectural beauty. Let Caesar's be your host for the day from morning to late night and you'll spend a day to remember: see a show go window shopping snack have a drink by the fountains have fun at the tables. If you stay over don't miss the wonderful pool and outdoors.
50,Vanderpump restaurant is very beautiful and Cesar‚Äôs Casino has so much to offer! Lots of different machines to play lots of restaurants entertainment is top rated .. easy access to forum and so many shops to choose from!
50,Zandra checked us in and did an excellent job. She went out of her way to get our group rooms together along with early check in. We were tired and in need of some rest and lunch. Early check in was so helpful. Thanks Zandra! You got our trip off to a great start.
50,Love playing at Caesars. Great restaurants and entertainment. Staff is friendly and offer top notch experience. Rewards program is good. Location is perfect. I do wish there was a slightly better selection of slots.
50,Restaurants were great my wife enjoyed the spa and we had a great VIP host Ed Simmons. The blackjack dealers and floor men were very friendly. Be sure to try Water Grill...best fish dinner!  Also NY-Style Di Fara's pizza was excellent.
50,Hotel and casino is very clean all rest room area is clean all personnel is very friendly. Over all an awesome resort. We always love to stay in the total reward resorts never a bad experience. Thank you.
50,Caesar‚Äôs is my favorite place to stay in Vegas! Great location nice rooms and friendly staff. Two casinos convenient shopping and a variety of restaurants in close proximity make it a favorite for me.
50,This stay was to celebrate our 10th year wedding anniversary. We arrived in the morning but got all checked in. We got a great room with a view of the pools. We had a pool day that was really fun. The pools were heated. Restaurants were amazing. It was a really good experience.
20,I think they nickel and dime you to death. You must pay for housekeeping to come  pay for k cups if you want to make coffee in your room . Pay if you want to use the refrigerator in the room . All this after you pay for the room and service charge . Your spending your money in their Casino but your paying for all little things most Hotels have as their amenities. I wish I would have researched a little better . It was my 25 wedding anniversary and I thought a nicer hotel would be great . But I was wrong .
40,Almost everything was good except for the wiFi connection and signal. The room eating facilities and service was exceptional. I am just writing more to get to 200 characters. I don't know what else to say.
50,Our room accommodations were excellent. Great view of the fountains and quiet. All of the staff we encountered could not have been nicer or more helpful. You can't beat Caesars for the ambiance amenities and location. Fun casino as well!
10,Joe D at the front desk is rude and disrespectful management really needs to listen to his call with me to see was kind of staff members you have presenting the hotel.  Safety and security of the my suite was an issue ack to connecting room was broken. The other room whom I did not the guest in the room could enter mine. The safe was broken. Found a joker wild card in my room with white residue on it.  Waited 30 minutes on the phone to have a manager switch my room and failed to do so. In turn I had to call back again to to have my room switched.  Was never informed they would not be serving food at the cabana's due to renovation.
50,My husband and I celebrated our 20 year wedding anniversary. After looking at almost every hotel and trying to figure out where to stay we landed on Caesars. My husband had never been to Vegas and I had only stayed off the strip. We made the right decision on staying here. We relaxed by the pool and played the slots and won (during the week). We ate at Mesa which was ok a bit on the expensive side but hey we were in Vegas.    Our room was awesome. We stayed in the Palace Tower studio suite which was worth the extra cost as it was huge with 2 bathrooms and conveniently next to the pool entrance. We had a view of the pools and a bit of the Bellagio fountains.    Only downside is the food court isn't that great and breakfast options weren't the best. Would love to see more of a pastry selection. Pronto was very expensive. And the price of cocktails in the Colosseum were really really expensive.    But we loved this hotel and would stay again for sure.
50,Whenever I come to Las Vegas if I am planning my trip and stay (not business related) we choose to stay at a Caesar's Property- if not Caesars Palace itself! The options for food are spectacular the wide array of table gaming and the employees are all working hard to ensure that your stay is a great one. Each time I come I certainly overindulge but the staff there make sure that I am safe and not bothering anybody and continue to enjoy my vacation as I intended.    I try always to stay at Caesar's Palace- but when they are unavailable I still make sure I get one of their properties as the program they have is truly unparalleled. I am fortunate (or some would look at it unfortunate) to have a casino host assigned to me and she keeps in touch with me throughout my visit to make sure that I have everything I need and that everything is going smoothly.    I highly recommend staying here. It's worth it- you won't be disappointed! Unless you have a beeper- sometimes you can't get service on it. (kidding)
20,The hidden resort fees of $45.00 per day and overcrowded pool was annoying. Driving on and off the property is a nightmare. Just felt herded and nickel and dimed to death. Been coming for 40 years and it's not for gamblers anymore.
50,We stayed here back in April and decided to return for our anniversary in September. The room was very clean spacious and comfortable. We were in the Augustus Tower this time but we found that we prefer the Palace Tower (where we stayed last time) as it is closer to the pool and casino area.    The hotel is in a great location on the Strip as it is close to a lot of the other popular casinos and restaurants. But you can also get to restaurants and shops without leaving the hotel. One section of the casino has a food court area with several quick-service restaurants (Smashburger was one of the options can't remember what else).    We rented a cabana at the Venus pool and it had a TV couches and a fridge stocked with waters and red bull. They also brought us some chips and a fruit tray. Our cabana host Leo was fantastic! He is very friendly and always made sure that we had everything we needed. Our waitress Ashley was very good too.
50,choices were immense desserts were incredible thank you for comping myself and my colleagues for a nice dinner. the line was a bit long but the hour wait was worth it A very busy restaurant with more food in adjacent rooms a bit confusing set up
50,Had a great time gambling and food was great. Service was excellent. Enjoyed the pool and all the amenities at Caesars Palace. Total Rewards Program is great and I can't wait to go back. I highly recommend.
20,Not the location that I booked. This was not the first time Caesars has changed my location. I feel as a loyal member I also should be treated to respect and gratitude. Caesars should honor all the reservations as there are booked.
40,All services were great except the restaurants and buffet.  There are much better places to eat in Las Vegas so I would recommend you stay at Caesar and eat somewhere else.  Visit the shops and pool at Caesars. They are hidden jems.
50,The rooms are clean and the staff are very friendly. They have a good amount of slots and large selection of stores to shop from. It's situated right in the middle of the strip and a close walk to the other hotels and great restaurants.
50,Each and every time I stay at Caesars Palace the staff exceed my expectations with quality customer service and attention to detail. When I arrived I was told I was eligible for an upgraded and wow the room was fantastic! I stay there whenever I'm in Las Vegas.
50,Here for a conference and SO IMPRESSED with the facilities and atmosphere. I would like to send a shout out to Zandra for her excellent customer service! Would definitely recommend Caesars Palace to anyone!!
50,Very convenient location. Close to a lot of shopping and restaurants as well as all the shopping and dining options on site.  Rooms are very clean and maid service is very friendly.  Very nice pool area and very attentive bar service.  Went to a show while we were there and the venue is very nice and comfortable.
50,Caesars has attracted Wonderful names from across the platforms Giada's onsite restaurant was Incredible! And with that! I became a 'Hero' of sorts.... Thank you everyone for making us feel special during my 'Work' trip & taking care of my significant others needs.... Thank You it meant a LOT!
50,Caesars is a huge property but stayed in the Augustus tower which was perfect!! Amazing view of the Bellagio fountains in a 2 queen room on the 39th floor. Room is very spacious & bathroom has separate toilet shower jacuzzi tub & double sinks. There‚Äôs a keurig coffee maker in room but be sure to take your own k-cups as the ones in room are VERY expensive!!  All staff very friendly from front desk to housekeeping!  Found slots to be very tight so unfortunately didn‚Äôt do a lot of gambling here but at other total rewards properties.  As usual the diamond lounge was great with awesome drinks & snacks. Pool area amazing but need to go early to get a lounge. Overall great place to stay & look forward to returning next year!
50,Awesome time.. beautiful hotel. Accomodations were phenomenal. View was gorgeous. 1st staying @ this hotel and everything was worth the money. Lovwd the whole atmosphere. The staff was great. The hotel is a really busy all the time but other that definitely in a great location.
50,Just a beautiful location but it is huge so wear your sneakers its a lot of walking! but lots to see and do various stores and restaurants some very high end that you only find in Las Vegas. It takes a good amount of time to see everything but the live statutes are also amazing - a real must see
20,Have a health issue was arriving 10 am prior to check in so bought the previous night. Made notes in my reservation to that effect. Had I not made a random call to double check our reservation would have been cancelled at 2 am bc we hadn‚Äôt arrived on the previous day. Had to move heaven and earth to pay the extra day so we could be guaranteed 10am checkin. Upon leaving we did the auto checkout by phone scheduled for 11am. They locked us out of our room well before 11 with our luggage inside. The was a post cancer survival trip. The brought me to tears upon arrival and as I left. We‚Äôll try the Bellagio next time.
50,Our Augustus  Tower room had a great view of the Belagio Fountain and the surrounding light show from building sized graphics. Easy access to Casino restaurants and pool area. Even though we come to Vegas every year this was our first stay at Caesar's.
50,The room at Caesars was clean on admission and was kept clean throughout our stay. On one occasion we needed a few extra cups and housekeeping was able to supply them. The coffee pot was replaced but after reading the instructions I think there was not a problem with the pot.(sorry). Our party ate several times in Caesar's food court. The food was goodportion size generous andthere was a good variety of food. The staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful. As I stated in the survey the Host was helpful. When we visit Vegas everything we need is offered at Caesars and we spend the majority of our time at Caesars.
50,Love Ceasars very friendly people and somebody is always ready to help lots of entertainment and really nice restaurants the casino is very clean no issue while we were there we are definitely going to be going back
50,We stayed at the new towers Augustus and it was clean and spacious. We always like staying at Caesars Palace when we come to vegas. The pools are clean and very big plus there are so many of them so you can pick which vibe you want to be around.
20,A beautiful hotel but your room is full of sensors! Do not open the fridge and place a water a $75 fee will be added to your stay. Did you touch the water on the counter get ready to pay $75 plus the water cost! Need a pullout bed $30 per night want to order a burger $45. And even after giving them your money there staff is super rude! Sure there is allways the guy waiting in line to get ripped off!
30,So my review is purely based on that I am a frequent visitor of Las Vegas. This was my first time staying at Caesars everytime I go I stay somewhere different. Stayed in Octavious tower. When we upgraded the room I had expected more for the price the room was clean bed was comfortable but seemed a little far for the walk to and from the room. The biggest disappointment was during the day they never had BJ tables for less than $25 minimum and hardly any tables open because of this it had us going elsewhere everyday to play. At night there was only one $15 blackjack table which was always very busy and the table never really seemed to play with the players. We only played late night on our way back to the room because of the price and on Saturday night it was minimum $25 the entire day my guess is cause of the nightclub. The slots seemed tight as well. I never come to Vegas expecting to win but I do like if the machines at least play with me. The traffic to get a cab in and out of the resort is a nightmare one night we made the sad mistake of taking a cab instead of an uber (use uber to get around it's way cheaper) we racked up almost an extra $5 sitting in traffic to turn into caesars at the entrance light because the cabs going in and out of ceasars were all backed up so we couldnt pull in. The restaurants were extremely expensive it's vegas so food and drink is expensive and to be expected but we stopped one night pretty late at the restaurant near check-in desk a BLT a breakfast sandwich 2 sodas was $80 crazy. We never found the food court until the last day got pizza (dont recommend). In the past we usually play the most where we stay. The property is huge so I found that it was inconvenient to get to other casinos it was quite a walk to get anywhere else even if it was just across the street. Overall I would say the property is beautiful and of course it has a nostalgia about it but I personally think its over priced. In the future I would rather stay at the Venetian or the Cosmo and pay less money for the room and have a better selection of tables slots and affordable food.
30,We just returned home from Caesars. Although we had a wonderful time there with friends I do not feel I would return to this hotel.  We stayed in room 6414 of the Forum Tower. Upon entering the room we were disappointed in the decor. The bathroom was updated but the room desperately needs updating. The dresser front was severely scratched. The curtains were green the couch was purple and the chairs were brown. Our friends stayed on the 62nd floor and were disappointed in the outdated room as well. Hopefully the hotel will be considering upgrading the rooms in that tower in the foreseeable future.  The casino had a musty smell and was dark. It would be nice if Caesars would consider pumping in some air freshener into the air.  Caesars is a great location and has wonderful restaurants but needs upgrading in our opinion.
50,Everything was first class. There was not a refrigerator in our room other than the mini-bar so they brought one immediately. The All-American restaurant had fantastic food and the service was even better. We ate plenty of meals there.
50,The Caesars hotel was excellent. The food and service were very good. There were enough places to eat without leaving the hotel. The only disappointment was the temperature of the water at the pool. It was like ice water and no one was swimming. The food and drink service at the pool could be greatly improved.
50,The whole resort with beautiful it actually felt like you were in a Roman Palace. There were many many restaurants to choose from. On top of that there was a mall inside the palace. Then there was four gorgeous swimming pools that I know of. All this with beautiful fountains everywhere. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They went out of their way to make sure you enjoyed your stay. As far as gambling goes you name it they got it. Lots of fun and excitement !!!
50,The hotel and surrounding grounds are impeccable. It's like you've been transported to a magical place. Look forward to returning there in the future. All the employees were very friendly and seemed genuinely happy to help you. Loved the decor and the craftsmanship that went into the property. The casino area was nice. It offered a wide variety of different types of slots and of course gaming tables. Ceasars is like a city within its self. You wouldn't have to go any place else if you choose not to.
50,We traveled to Las Vegas to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary because we were attending the Rod Stewart concert we decided to stay at Caesar‚Äôs. We were not disappointed the rooms were spacious the bed was super comfortable and the forum tower was centrally located to the casino food court Gordon Ramsay‚Äôs restaurant and the theatre. If you enjoy lounging by the pool Caesars would be a great choice several pools to choose from.
50,My room was fabulous the pools are magnificent help is always available plenty of dining options. Location is perfect on the strip Valet is quick and easy. Check in /out is made simple. The forum shops are incredible.
40,I was offered to a room for my bday i enjoyed the visit and decided to return the following weekend and experienced similar positive atmosphere the hotel was built few decades ago yet it is more mordenized than some of the other hotel near by like the Paris and even Bellagio (only compare economy room).
50,The hotel is physically beautiful. Good restaurants in the hotel. In each restaurant or lounge I was in the staff was friendly efficient and helpful. The check-in process is long. If possible I would pre-check in and then pick up keys at the smaller line. I think $40.00 for the pre-check in is excessive
50,Four of us traveled to Vegas to celebrate a 21st and 25th birthday. For three of us this was their first time to Las Vegas. Caesars Palace is centrally located on Las Vegas Blvd and is a wonderful hotel to stay in for your first visit. The hotel is clean the room was large the beds were very comfortable and the floor was quiet.
50,I was here for a quick work trip and apparently so was everyone else. Caesars is HUGE and can be extremely overwhelming. With that said I personally wanted to thank Julie P at the front desk for helping me get a room. I was part of a room block that couldn't check-in on the computers and after being pointed in EVERY direction Julie was the one that made things easiest. It was nice having a friendly face get me through the anxiety of million people that were there and made sure that stay was as comfortable as possible.    Little things like this matter when I'm travelling. :)
40,Caesars offers a wide variation of bars lounges restaurants shopping entertainment and casino games. I have been traveling to Vegas fro over 20 years but this was my first time that I had stayed at caesars. I would return with my wife as I feel that she would also enjoy the grounds.
50,Beautiful venue for a concert; Casino was nice and clean variety of slot machines; nice variety of places to eat! We had a wonderful time at the Rod Stewart Concert! Had been there previously and it appears they have remodeled.
50,Room was really nice and had a couch which we got plenty of use out of there was a tear in the wall paper to the left of the tv. Room needs a mini fridge that isn‚Äôt a mini bar. In the octavious tower the elevators were quick once you got on them but slow to arrive.
50,Had a great time staying at this hotel. It is huge after we had figured out the lay of the hotel it was easy to get around the staff are really friendly and the facilities are awesome. There are plenty of places to choose to eat which is what we liked didn't really have to leave the hotel
40,we arrive on September.24.2019 very busy hotel upon arrival at the front desk. staff at the front desk were very very nice. checking in was pretty fast. we stay at the Julius tower. the room is very nice and will go back again soon i hope!
50,it's a nice place to hang around while waiting for the show(rod stewart). play a few hours with the slot and dinner before the show started.i consider this place a good start while in vegas and so as the employee they're professional
50,I live in Hawaii but we have a big conference Grand Opening of Bioreigns USA  just Launched first time to the world on 27-28 Sep 2019 and we choose here to be the best place to start our CBD business Our member almost 500 people fly from all over the world .We thank you for taking care of us  and we will have meeting every year  hope to keep good memory if good deals üëçand we love Vegas  just a fun place to visit  (Something that I stay at room 6018  the room next door super super loud  I can‚Äôt sleep for 2nights  so I use pillow to close my earüò¥ and the 2nd night I went out and back at 3am. Alone and both key card not working  so I call the security guard came quick to open the door for me üí§(thank god) see u soon
50,I wanted an upgrade to my players card so the staff at the poker room suggested taking a competitors card to the players club and see if they could help. They were very helpful and told me what I would need to get the upgrade. Now I have the card I wanted and am playing poker at Caesars Palace to maintain the status for next year. Thank you James at the poker room and the players club staff!
50,My husband and I had a great time playing at Caesars. We were able to get drinks frequently and the atmosphere we were playing in was perfect! We were staying at another hotel and really wanted to play with their players club instead but ended up spending a lot of our time at Caesars because we enjoyed it there so much more! The location of Caesars on the strip was also better than some of the other hotels.
40,We asked our son where he wanted to celebrate his 7th birthday and he had only place in mind. And that was Caesars Palace in Las Vegas!    he only likes to stay their hotel because of the whirlpool bathes comfortable beds and delicious pizza and food.    He loves walking around and checking out their fountains and statues too.    He told us on our drive back home to Cali that he wanted to go back next year for his 8th LOL.    Thank You ALL at Caesars for making his birthday a very special one
40,We arrived at the hotel and right away I was pissed bc we booked a king bed and we got 2 queens. Great way to spend my 10 year wedding anniversary.  The casino isn't the greatest.  I found that we played more at MGM properties
50,Room and bedding was awesome. Food was great. And of course Rod  Stewart was amazing. Played the tables but the dealers were fun as were the hostesses . Our room was available when we got there and the guest service personnel were helpful with directions. The Shopping area alone is worth the trip.
40,The room was spacious and comfortable. Caesars is a Vegas staple. Tables on the weekend have high minimums but your paying for the atmosphere I guess. Pool is nice but the sun blocks out half of it for half the day. Get there early for a seat
40,Nothing exciting they need more excitement and more people to encourage you to try different things. Someone to point you to the right places and let you know what‚Äôs going on and where. Music in the casino area could make it livelier. Something to make it smell a bit fresher would also help.
50,It was a short vacay for anice resort stay hell yah it was ceasars palace shout out to mehret who helped us at the front desk Ivy who also helped us on our room request. As Arnold says we'll be back . ASTALA VISTA for now
50,Humongous rooms great conference room inviting machines but be sure you get the right one so you dont lose a lot of money. And the food rest are accommodating. Thanks. I have had a reunion conference before and I was so amazed by the venue hall and the height of the elevators just like magical and so overwhelming you're so excited and happy but fearful that you might trip over and fall otherwise great overall!!!
50,The whole trip was a pleasure everyone was nice & helpful they gave me a nice room comp money to gamble & rewards points to have free buffet & buy stuff at the hotel store & went to the Christina Aquila concert which was in the same hotel
40,Had a great time at Caesars Vegas. Check in was easy room was upgraded with a view plenty of great restaurant choices and centrally located on the stip. Although the pool was busy we were able to get chairs but best to plan ahead if you want to sit in the sun.
50,Beautiful hotel casino and shopping areas. Had a great time just walking around the premises and seeing all Caesar‚Äôs has to offer. Restaurants were beautiful and the food fantastic. I would advise anyone to visit Caesar‚Äôs Palace.
10,room was dusty you have to pay to watch football games in the sports book on Saturday and Sunday from 75 to 200 dollars per seat they also shut the pool down on a Sunday at 3pm for a private party never again
50,Took my wife for a Birthday trip to Vegas. We moved around between 3 different hotels finishing our stay at Caesar‚Äôs Palace. It is still an exceptional hotel that my wife absolutely loved!! I would highly recommend staying here!!
40,The room was beautiful overlooking the pool. The bed was very comfortable. The service was great. The only thing I would have liked better the walk to the room was not so far away from the main hallway.
50,I‚Äôve been to Vegas many time and stayed in different hotels but Caesars was on my bucket list. The minute I walked into the lobby I knew it would be elegant. Our room was a huge king room overlooking the many pools with a partial strip view of hotels and mountains. It had a very comfy bed sofa and chair with huge glass shower and jacuzzi tub. Will be on my list again to stay!!
50,I had a 2 night comped room and Caesars gave me an awesome suite! The dinner at The Old Homestead Restaurant was amazing - Alaska king crab appetizer wagyu ribeye steak and asparagus.  Everywhere I went employees were friendly and informative.  Had a lot of fun playing the variety of slot machines.
10,Poor customer satisfaction a general disregard for the poor service we were given and no real follow up to ensure we were happy with the results of our vacation. Will be tough to stay at a caesars property
50,My room was large and very comfortable. View was great. The tower I was in was very  close to the casino. Housekeeping was good. The front desk folks were very professional.  I would go back anytime. I am sure I'll go back.
50,A group of us try to spend one long weekend in Vegas each year.  Caesars Palace has the best pool and games. The staff is wonderful! The buffet they offer is the best in town.  I would recommend a girls or guys weekend at Caesars!
50,My hotel room was large and very clean. The view facing Las Vegas Boulevard was also very nice. The maids kept our room in tip top condition and anytime you needed something they were there to help me .Over all it was an excellent experience. I am looking forward to going back soon.
40,Did not stay on property came to see a show (Wayne Newton - was great) and played a bit.  Had fun and won some money (which was great) was happy to see a lively casino that was glitzy but not terribly tacky. We have not spent as much time at Caesars over the last 5 years or so because the client base seemed to have shifted to an fairly rowdy crowd (trying to have a Hangover experience I think) and it was not as enjoyable for us. We were pleased that the atmosphere seems to have shifted back somewhat to the Caesars we loved 15-20 years ago.
50,I chose to play slots at Caesars for the first time. I enjoyed my extended play at the slots even though I did not stay at Caesars but on my next trip I plan to enjoy the comfort of Caesars. See You Soon!!!
50,Casino was fun. I like the location on the strip. Staff was friendly and informative. There is lots of places to choose from to eat. There is a wide variety of slot machines to play. All in all a very good time.
50,As soon as we arrived the staff took their time to help us with all our rooms. They were helpful and friendly. Basically went overboard to assist us. Accommodations were great. Room was well kept and clean.
40,Best location and arguably most outstanding architecture.  Check in takes too long and we were given an upgraded Julius room with 2 queens as they had oversold standard king rooms I had booked. Would have preferred king room.  Pool area is fantastic although they don‚Äôt do enough to make beds available so it is hard to get if you‚Äôre not an early riser. Smell of stale weed not very nice by the main bar area.  Hotel is pretty amazing otherwise.
40,Caesar's has a great very experienced staff. All reservations were met. Tables were waiting at restaurants. Good selection of restaraunts. Roome was ready and nicely done. Very few lines and staff seemed anxious to be of help. With the mall attached no reason to go elswhere except for particular shows.
50,great trip loved it. very clean nice people well organized. my host is the best look forward to return trip. went to grand canyon did a O circus show. my uncle and fianc√© went as well and both want to return. I won a jack pot on the slot machines
50,Checked in at the platinum member area and spoke with Emma. She was supper helpful during check in. Informative and delightful. Room was clean and in great condition when we arrived. Room was ready for check in
50,Hotel beautiful. Rooms gorgeous. Good food and helpful staff! Perfect couples vacation. Enjoyed the tables and slots. The hotel is center if everything. Well worth the money and recommend this hotel!!
40,We only visited the casino. The casino game machines was varied fun and the number available was substantial. We enjoyed stopping by this year (twice during our trip). We would certainly visit again.
50,We stayed in the julius ceaser suite and it was awsome no complaints at all. The staff was helpful and the casino is great. Nice selection of food to eat from in ceasers palace.over all a great place to stay
50,Caesars is a Vegas must. So many different gaming dining and shopping options. The environment is clean and classy. Drink service while gaming is prompt. Staff are courteous and professional. Good times :)
50,best place in vegasdecent and overall awesome experiencelove the spa and all amenities.service is awesome and no complain at all..will definitely comeback on my nxt tripconsider as my home in vegas..
40,The room was lovely and clean. The staff were amazing. The cost of staying at this hotel way too expensive. A glass of wine $17 a bottle of beer $14. A large coffee not a fancy coffee $8. Out of reach for families.
50,Hotel pools casino excellent. Sportsbook was great. Customer service was excellent. Not much more i can ask for definitely know how to accommodate guest especially casino players! Place is ran correct and everyone who works there is happy to help you!
40,Overall had a pretty decent stay. Only a couple of hiccups that were easily corrected. Had a good time. Wish it was easier to get drinks while we were gambling. Waitress were not out early and when they were we only seen them every 30 minutes.
50,Caesars knows the importance of excellent customer service. The staff is very accommodating and friendly and always willing to help and provide information. The shows they have on site have something for everyone. Absinthe is a show that everyone should check out but leave the kids at home for this one. I saw it for the 1st time on my last visit and plan on seeing again when I go in the future. The casino is clean and laid out very nicely. They have a lot of options for different of dining and plenty of shopping available on the premises. I would strongly recommend staying at Caesars whenever in Vegas!
50,Everything was wonderful staff was great overall great experience. Most definitely would recommend and come back again. By far one of my favorite hotels in Vegas. Love the fact that there's a fat Tuesday too!
50,I love Caesars Palace the Augustus Tower in particular. I feel like part of a precious few to be able to stay there. I enjoy the room the amenities the huge swimming pool (nobody could tell me how long it is the big one). I like the Latin Inscription you can see from the pool ‚ÄúOmnia mutantur nos et mutamos in illis‚Äù
50,We went to Caesar Palace for one night as a vacation. I play black jack in the pool which is a very special experience. Then we went to Qua for spa. The facility is amazing. We tried different pools and steam room. After the spa we went to Nobu Japanese restaurant. We chose the menuless course. That means you tell the chef what you (don't) want to get. Of course we will come back again to try the Omnia night club next time.
40,I wanted to surprise my wife with a Rod Stewart show so he was performing at Caesar's Palace. We booked two nights great room main casino bar the best. The only down side was the coffee in the room had to be puchased really! The amount we paid for a rrom n the Augustus Tower and charged for house coffee. That was the reason for losing one star.
40,Front desk personal was very nice & efficient. Had to request several times for the room to be cleaned. One day it was 7pm & it still wasn't cleaned. The hallway by the pool smelled like sewage and told multiple employees who all said they did not smell anything.
50,Service was great from check in to check plus all the in betweens also from cocktail waitresses to cleaning crew to servers to maids to dealers plus pit bosses. Super clean and great location. I missed getting to the pool so need to come back soon.
50,I always stay at Ceazars the rooms and staff are always top shelf. Comfort and service is what you want in Vegas. I love the shows table games and service. Ordered room service was really good and fast. The late check out is perfect.
50,Always a fun time at Caesar's Palace Las Vegas. If your looking for name stars such as Brooks and Dunn with Reba or Rod Stewart or a number of other performers you won't be sorry. Also plenty of slot machines and table games as well. Countless bars and dining choices are available. Make sure you get the Caesar's reward club when you go there. If you don't have fun it's your own fault.
50,My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights last week and I have to say it was a fantastic stay. We have stayed here in the past but this stay far exceeded any other visits we have had in the past. The front desk provided top quality customer service the moment we arrived. As always the food options were delicious. If you've never been to their pool I urge you to try to check it out at least once it is arguably the best pool in Las Vegas. We could have stayed in the pool alone for the entire trip. The rooms were immaculate and I could not have asked for a better vacation. Thanks to Mr. Miller and Mr. Sanudo for their hospitality and top notch service. I will return soon to continue to create new fun and positive memories at Caesars Palace.
10,"had a terrible check in experience huge uncontrolled celebration in check in area hundreds of loud people horns blasting could barely get through the crowd to check in; check in person barely said two words to us could care less that we were getting married the next day; no offer of luggage assistance or tell us where the hotel elevator was; reached our wedding/honeymoon suite only to find out that check in person gave us room ""666""; neither room key worked; had to wait for security to let us in to at least drop off the ton of luggage we had been dragging around room was small and dingy and looked like what you would expect from a cheap off strip motel  spoke with several Caesar employees regarding the situation none of which were willing to assist us in any way treated us poorly and could have just cared less. Ended up back waiting in line to pay likely more than list price for a suite in order to get out of room ""666"" and oh by the way avoid anyone in Caesars with a Wyndam name tag as they will give you some sales pitch offering you free whatever and will insult you if you decline. Not exactly the upscale atmosphere you would expect from just looking at the beautiful pictures of the Caesars property online. Also from reading other poor reviews unless you have a high players card they could care less. Otherwise staying there is a roll of the dice as if you have an issue or happen to get the wrong check in person don't expect any assistance or to be treated with respect."
50,Ralph from the reservation desk employee gave us room upgrade and we like to thank Ralph and Caesars Palace Hotel. We played the slot machine and won a few dollars. Everyone of the team members are wonderful and curtesy to visitors.Thank you very much from Fred & Ruth
50,Stayed at Caesars September 25-28. Checked in early. Paid $30 early check-in fee and was given a free upgraded room in the Julius Tower as a Platinum member. I read reviews prior to my arrival so I knew about the fees parking no free coffee no refrigerator so I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. Duncan at the front desk was great. We did not even open the refrigerator. Knew they charge $75 if you open it and move anything. Didn‚Äôt even touch the snacks as there are sensors on everything. Brought our own k-cups sugar and cream. You will be charged $15 for 4 k-cups if you open the box. It is clearly marked that it is not free. Slots were great in the early morning. Seemed to be tighter later in the day. Pools were great but crowded. I definitely recommend this hotel and will stay here again.
50,Our Host Steve Abbott is the BEST! Everyone at Caesars offers a wonderful guest experience from Guest check in housekeeping dining casino servers and floor personnel. Keep up the providing this level of service.
50,This was our sixth stay in the Caesars Las Vegas and as usually we have stayed in the Augustus Tower.  Our stay was wonderful most thanks to the excellent help from Pasquale Romano Director of Lifestyle VIP Services. He has helped with our reservations arranged transportation from the airport and several other items. He has had a superior performance and we are very grateful to him. He is an excellent resource that Caesars has my congratulations to the Hotel.  The room was beautiful clean the housekeeping services are well performed at any time you need them. The regular housekeeper Faiza was excellent in all aspects. Anything you need by phone from Customer Services was executed well and fast. Kelvin the Housekeeping Runner was also excellent.  The view from our room was magnificent looking toward the South Strip and the Bellagio Lake.  All times we needed services from the reception we had no problems being well served by Jeremy Lei and others.  The restaurants in the hotel are all excellent: in Cafe Americano Rao‚Äôs Trevi Starbucks you can always have good food and nice services.  The Casino itself is large and well maintained.  One of the few negative points is the internet that is bad. The connection falls all the time and we were charged in some days for having more than 2 devices connected.  The days were full pleasure and we will always return here.
50,Could not have been better! Check in was quick. Lived like a ‚ÄúCaesar‚Äù for a week! It‚Äôs in the center of everything so we were able to walk most places we wanted to visit. Slots were loose. Casino & accommodations clean. Staff friendly & helpful.
10,Came to Caesar‚Äôs to see Seinfeld. Great show and I laughed until I cried! Dropped about $400 in the Casino lunch and dinner combined was about $225 stayed in an inexpensive room for $375. And when I wake up in the morning I‚Äôm looking for the coffee because it‚Äôs not located by the coffee pot. I‚Äôm told by a lovely lady at the front desk that the coffee in the room consisted of 4 K cups located in the snack tray and I will be charged $15. Thats it....I come to your establishment drop over a grand for one night and you want to charge for 4 K cups? I didn‚Äôt leave your resort. All my time was spent at Caesar‚Äôs from the valet parking to the drinks at the bar to entertainment food shopping (I didn‚Äôt mention the grand I spent on a jacket)  the show with drinks and you want to charge me $15 for 4 K cups? From now on I will stay at another hotel and come to Caesar‚Äôs only to see the shows. So thank you Caesar‚Äôs for dampening the mood at the end of a great trip! Now I‚Äôm packing to get out of your resort as soon as I can.
50,Very helpful and attentive. Concierge was more than helpful and exceeded are expectations. Staff at casino were courteous could not ask for more .tellers were helpful and did not mind repeating answers. Will recommend to al my friends and all on social media. Thanks again for such a wonderful experience..can't wait for another visit. Counting the days...
50,Service and rooms terrific ! Food everywhere somewhat pricey. Casino personnel great! Beautiful shops and amenities. Easy to get hundreds of steps during the day for exercise. Decor beautiful. Fountains a plus. Views from rooms great.
50,The room was clean! We had a great view! Very nice shower! Pools were awesome!! I really liked the warm pool!! The BEST breakfast buffet I‚Äôve ever had!! So yummy!!! Lots of different foods! Definitely something for everyone!!! Can‚Äôt wait to go back!!
50,I recently spent a week at Ceaser Palace in Las Vegas. Upon arrival I was totally impressed by the front lobby being very swift and easy check in.It was my birthday and the host offered me a very nice upgraded suite .place was run like a smooth machine the place was very clean and welcoming with everything aspect of the hotel. I definitely don't have a problem returning to this place for a second. Also very easy check out places.
50,Let me kick this off it was a great room with every thing you would ever need. It had a great view of of the strip. The parking was easy to get in and out. Forgot to mention the room it was quit and well stocked with what every thing you could need.
50,Definitely would want to stay at Caesar's again if I could whenever I get a chance to return to Vegas. My second choice would be tied between Harrah's and Bally's because of where they're located on the strip. Caesar's was by far (from what I saw) the most exciting in the vicinity and everything from the bars to pools to rooms were awesome.    The customer service from check-in to check-out was fantastic as well!
50,A great place. Clean rooms. Courteous service and great restaurants. Get a players card for Caesars properties and you'll get rooms comped if you play enough. Tables are pricey on weekends but there are 7 pools to choose from if you're into that. Plenty to do as usual here. The Forum shops will kill some time. Ate at the Water Grill 4 nights in a row. Outstanding seafood and service.
50,Just beautiful  a lot walking but worth it! The shops are amazing and statues are beautiful .. must see statue show Atlantis is really something to watch . Self check in is so easy and fast . Don‚Äôt wait in line !
50,First time staying at Caesar‚Äôs for us. Due to changes in plans we had two different room type reservations to cover our stay. Julia at the front desk was amazingly helpful in helping us sort that out and get us into one room for all of our nights. Our room in the Augustus tower was beautiful and clean and the bed was amazingly comfortable. We can‚Äôt wait to stay there again the next time we get to Vegas!
40,Room was great. View was not the best. Room service was great. Slots were tight. We have stayed at Paris several times and have always had a good time. Never won much. Most Restaurants were great. Service in the restaurants was good. Disappointing in Gordon Ramsey's restaurant. Portions were small and very expensive.
50,As part of my event package I was directed to the Athena Room by the Augustus Entrance for check-in. The fellow that helped me Tomek was most thoughtful helpful and made the whole process a pleasure.
50,Recently stayed at Caesars as part of a wedding party.  We stayed in a Julius deluxe room on the 12th floor of the Julius tower. Our room faced onto the strip and we had a view of the observation wheel.  The room was really spacious with a comfy king sized bed. The bathroom was big and has two sinks and a large shower. The room was very clean and towels changed daily.  The entire hotel is of a high class from the large pool area with multiple pools to the Forum shops. We spent a nice chilled day at the pool - there's a choice of pools to have a dip in and a good pool bar. The Forum shops is a must even if you don't plan on buy anything. Make sure to catch the Atlantis show if you can - it's worth a watch.  The wedding was in the Venus Gardens which was the perfect venue for the size of our wedding party (12 of us). Leading up to the wedding the co-ordinator was really helpful and on the day everything was fully explained to us and ran smoothly. The bride and groom even got a free bottle of champagne after the ceremony.  We had a great stay at Caesars and would highly recommend it if you're looking to add a touch of luxury to your stay in Vegas.
50,This place is awesome. Luxury at its finest. If you can make it down. Do it forsure. I come at least once a year and caesers is the go to. Why stay somewhere thsts just alright. This place is spectacular.
50,As always Caesars is the best place to stay. This was a business trip which was enjoyable due to the fact I got to stay at my favorite hotel.  Great food great service and a beautiful room. Made more like vacation ten work.  Thank you Caesar‚Äôs!
40,Only negative is room amenitiesbeautiful comfortlarge but no coffee in room. For the price there was nothing complementary. Dirty water glasses were never replaced. The pool area is GREAT! Ate at palm restaurant excellent food and service. The Bacchanal buffet is the best hands down.
50,Even though the building is old the facilities casino and rooms are very nice. Well maintained and the staff is great. We enjoyed a couple of the restaurants as well. We definitely recommend this place to anyone using their Cesars Rewards on a budget! :-))
40,Rooms are exceptional! Best location on the strip with everything you need right on the property. Poker room and sports book are perfect. Great pools and great food. You can't go wrong staying at Caesars Palace
50,Everything you could want under one roof food was great shopping shows people were helpful we had international people with us an easy for them to get around alone if they chose too go out an not get lost. Spa personnel was great.
50,All companies in the service industry ought to take a lesson from Caesars properties. their treatment of customers is outstanding. They always go the extra mile to ensure the customer is treated with great care and comfort.
50,Hotel was amazing friendly staff and energetic atmosphere. Will come and stay again. Great food selection for them late nights and something always going on around each corner of the property. Can‚Äôt wait to come back.
50,First time guest. Great staff! Beau. Elpidio. Tina. Too many names to recall but all equally kind and helpful to this lost guest. The property is HUGE. And filled with way too many great restaurant choices to sample in a short stay. Try Mesa Grill. And ... well as many other restaurants as you can. AND the Buffet.
50,Professional friendly & caring staff in all areas. Great location & views for restaurants shops walks etc. Rooms spacious comfy clean & quiet. The ambiance is elegant clean friendly & interacting. Thnx
50,Incredible experience at this place. Wow is not even close to the way that not only the facilities bring to the table but also the staff friendliness and professionalism. Will definitely come back to Vegas to visit this magnificent place.
50,Very good hotel with lot of option of eating and shopping. Rooms were big and very comfortable. Its worth the money. Love the experience. Staff was friendly and helpful. Thank you. Buffet was very delicious and have good options. I tried dinner and breakfast both. They were very good.
50,Excellent room view and design. Very good and centra location. The room was very clean. Staff very helpful. Good dinning experience with warm and friendly environment. overall a great hospitality. Just perfect
20,If you are looking for a great hotel with a service definitely it is not the place. The hotel is great however forget about the service the only thing that they need is money. I had not a very pleasant situation with a valet parking service where employees show me that it is doesn't meter for them if they do their job or no but I have to pay for the service that I didn't receive otherwise I will not get my car. Wi-fi cannot be worse I had internet connection one evening rest of the time I used my data on the I phone that was much better than the connection in the hotel even after I called to the internet service agent. Late check out was refused even if you ready to pay for this.
50,This was my first experience staying in Caesar‚Äôs Palace and certainly my most memorable trip to Vegas. I had a great check in experience. The host who checked us in was kind polite friendly and made us feel very special. Her name was Mehret and you are lucky if she checks you in when staying in Caesar‚Äôs Palace. Her positive energy was outstanding. I can also call her Lady luck since in this trip for the first time I did hit the jackpot in and got a hand pay üòäüôè.    The room was big clean and neat! The shower and jacuzzi in room was the cherry on top! I can‚Äôt say enough on how comfortable the bed was. In general I suggest Caesars palace if you want to make it the most memorable trip when visiting Las Vegas.    Only one suggestion: It would be nice if they would not charge for the Coffee you make in your room. It is not the matter of price since we all know how much we spend when we go to Vegas and casinos but it would be a very nice gesture to make it free or at least free for the invited guests.    Cheers to all the awesome Caesars Palace‚Äôs personnel! I would definitely stay with them again.
50,Caesars is for kids also! My husband and I took our 6 year old Son for 4 nights last week. We dined at various restaurants throughout the week. All Caesars properties. Oyr Son was treated like a King. Particularly at Gordon Ramsey's steakhouse at Paris.    So much to do and the pools were beyond luxurious.    Our room was spacious immaculate and with a fabulous view We will be back soon!
40,Room was great. Clean and maids did a great job. Check in took way too long. There were too few agents. Buffet was so good. Everything was delicious. Will visit again soon. Slots were tight. Wish they had been a little more friendly.
50,One of the most beautiful hotel and casino on the las Vegas strip! All the employees were very welcoming and attentive to me and my family. They helped us sign up for the reward program. The casino floor and restrooms were very clean I was very impressed.
40,The restaurants are the best. I have never seen such an impressive sportsbook. Valet attendants and in fact the entire staff were helpful and courteous. In the future I plan to only stay at Caesars Palace. I have yet to try their Garden of the Gods for swimming. Perhaps next May I can make it back there for that.
50,We stayed at planet Hollywood this visit but plan to stay at Caesar's palace next visit. We had tickets to Christina Aguilera show so decided to stay there. We were very disappointed with her show though she started an hour late and only performance a little over an hour part of the time she spent changing clothes tremendous disappointment.
50,Had dinner at the Homestead steakhouse shopped and gambled. Had a wonderful experience with helpful people. It is a wonderful place to stay and have everything available to you without leaving the properly.
30,Long lines slow service pricey. Expansive place. Long walk from garage. On plus side Caesar has kept place in tip top condition. Expensive buffet but pretty good selection of dishes. For price it‚Äôs a once in lifetime experience.
10,I'll try to keep it brief but not so easy so much wrong. 1/ Massive check in queues all weekend. 2/ 1 night my card didn't work so had to queue for 10 mins to then be told Security shift change so must wait 20 minutes to get into my room. 3/ They don't allow own drinks in room fridge even if there's space. 4/ Expect to wait 20+ mins per drink when sat playing Casino tables (maybe my own fault for watching too many Vegas movies where it shows drinks arriving thick and fast). 5/ Don't expect a sun lounger by pool if arrive after 11am.    Lowest mark from me as consequence of attitude of front desk and ridiculous need to wait to enter the room I'd paid for because their system had wrongly cancelled my room cards.
40,Caesars Palace is in a great location. Nice hotel the furniture in the Octavius Tower was wore though. The room was a little drab too. The tower is also a very long walk from the lobby. I would prefer a closer tower in the future. Nice sportsbook and I enjoyed watching the football games in the Montecristo Cigars Bar. They closed the pool to guest on Sunday without letting us know too. I thought they should have reimbursed the $44 resort fee for that day but no luck.
50,My 1st time to Vegas. Stayed at Caesar's Palace the room was very big the beds were very comfortable. We had an excellent view of the Strip and nightlife. Hotel was excellent very clea. The staff was friendly and helpful.
50,Stayed for business will come back for leisure. Overall everything was very clean but most importantly the room was especially clean. Stayed in the Palace Tower. Enjoyed a business reception poolside and the food provided was very good. Location is very handy as there are off-site attractions just across the street.
50,A fabulous complex packed with everything you need to make your stay great including food drink pool area and shops not to mention the great casino. We had excellent service in all areas with particularly helpful reception staff. Use self park as it is cheaper than Valet and can also be charged to your room and reception can give you in and out access so long as you mention it on arrival.
50,Room was nice had view of the fountain at Bellagio and stripfood was great shops so nice the show was great room service menu little pricier than I expected but breakfast menu was very good food was delicious
50,Excellent service! Room was large and wonderful bed. I love the central location to everything. They have Omnia the best night club in the world. The shopping is also on the property I love the sports book as well!
50,Wayne Newton‚Äôs show was magnificent. His performance was amazing. Can‚Äôt believe he can play so many instruments and sing so well. He is a people person and definitely pleased the audience. I would definitely refer anyone who likes a great wholesome show with patriotism good humor friendliness and flicks of his former friends like Jack Benny Johnny Carson and Glen Campbell to visit Wayne‚Äôs ‚ÄúUp Close and Personal‚Äù show.
40,The room was nice and very clean as was the shower and bathroom. The only pet peeve was there were not enough outlets by the bedside. They should give more towels too we had to keep asking when we needed them because they would not leave enough. The bed was very comfortable they had everything you needed (shampoo soap and lotion was okay as was the blow dryer) except NO cups in the bathroom! OH and don't touch the fridge or the bar or they will nail you $75.00 each that includes the pods for the small kerig Fortunately we knew better! LOL... I think they should allow refrigerator use at no charge. There's a starbucks and coffee shops downstairs... place is huge but pretty well kept! I'd say. Slots were a lot of fun! The pool was really nice the warm pool was a little mirky and the others were VERY COLD! Lol...It was a Great stay though! I would recommend this hotel to friends.
10,Torn sheets. Holy pillow cases. No customer service. Rude money hungry people. Food is outrageously priced! They charge for a cup of tap water! Pposh on the palace! Yes.. big hole in sheets. Called they never showed to change. Very disappointed! First and last time to stay here! No star
50,Great Hotel and Casino people very friendly everywhere accomodations are great not to mention the pool it was a great relaxing time my spouse and I spend there. this is our 5th time staying there; although we also love to stay at other Hotel and Casinos when visiting Las Vegas this place still is one of our top choices ...sorry Bellagio and Wynn we still love you but Ceasars oh boy let me tell you ! :)
50,It is always so hard to find good customer service anywhere anymore but all of the Caesers locations that i have been to have been amazing! I have stayed at Caesars Paris and the Linq and they are all amazing. Everyone is always friendly and extremely helpful!
40,To live Vegas 1000% should be one of your top options. The rooms are requiring a little bit more maintenance for the amount of money that they ask for. Of course this is the result of the extreme use in the party sin city.
50,This was my first time staying at Caesars Palace we had great customer service! Anselmo checked us in and he was great! He offered us some upgrades and we were so happy with these options what a great stay!
50,we got good view from the room .it was new room too the building is new .the carpet is nice .the service was excellent!!  we were there just like shot get away from work...stress...and this is perfect .
50,the food the room pool area gambling sports viewing were all excellent enjoyed being at Caesars definitely will return in the near future will probably try another Caesar property next time to compare.
50,The best show on the strip imho is Absynthe. Im not a fan of the cirq shows and this is funny and the performances are amazing! That show is at Caesars! Fan of sushi? Nobu is one of my faves. Also at Caesars! Ive been to Vegas over 50 times and Caesars never disappoints! Ive stayed at other places but none have made me feel this welcome. Great customer service! If you like micheladas (a mexican spicy drink with beer) ciao ciao bar in the forum shops has the best (just make sure its martha making them).
20,Room was not clean-bathroom smelled like piss from bidet bar /cocktail lounge staff in casino lacks customer service and rude slot machines need to be upgraded only one casino waitress floating around entire floor no comped drinks while gambling. I will not return to Cesars in the future. I will stayed where my patronage and money is appreciated and rewarded.
50,Great room and view ! The room was clean and roomy for three. Our room was close to elevators. It was  a short visit no room service use to  evaluate. No issues checking in or  out. In room snacks and service are TV user friendly.
40,I traveled for a convention that was held at Caesar's Palace and stayed in the Palace Tower. It made it convenient to walk to and from the convention. I highly recommend it for the convenience. The rooms are great but they can use better pillows.
50,Wonderful employees to assist in all aspects of customer service. Caesars is a spectacular property.  The pool choices are exceptional with friendly wait staff throughout the complex.  Enjoyed the Rod Steward show within the complex.
50,Excellent resort to visit for entertainment & dining facility good location plenty of things to do gamble bar drinks food great amenities  service personal. we had a fantastic time for the time that we spend there
50,Excellent and friendly service centralized with a lot to do. Great dinning. Definitely recommend the nachos with short ribs lobster Mac and cheese and calamari at Gordon Ramsey and the paninis at Giara.
40,Initially placed in a room with an obstructed view without any indication at check-in. Otherwise our hotel stay was fine. After finding what appeared to be a medium size bug in our bed we were moved to an upgraded room with a fantastic view of the strip.
20,overall bad experience with communicating with the reception regarding our stay.  we have seperate room booking but the reception cannot find our information which need us to come to reception and communicated back and forth to just get a simple extend stay.  finally when they confirmed that they have found my booking info and said that need me to move out to my room and change new room for my last night which i did and packed my bags in the early morning and when i came to the reception for room changing only to find that i could actually stayed in the same room!! i mean it was frustrated and exhausted to have these unefficient conversations just to confirm my one more night stay and it was also unplesant to know that i could stay in the same room after i agree to change.  i stayed for 3 nights only and it was like i talked to the reception with different people hundred times about the same issue!!!
50,Great place clean best decorations great roomgreat viewgreat ambiance great staff. I had a great time great atmosphere ceasar palace is classy and hip at the same time. Great poolgreat restaurants ceasar palace very entertaining place to be.
50,Checked in to this hotel after being badly let down by Palms (paid upfront but they had double booked me) and needing a place after 6 hours drive. The reception was busy but Elipio (check name) couldn‚Äôt have been nicer !! He stopped my flapping and said he would find me a room with a nice view and it was !! A 19th floor room with a view over the magnificent pool! The rooms were very nicely decorated and very clean. Very good shower and two sinks plus large whirlpool bath !  The beds were really comfortable and clean. The pool is amazing and plenty of lifeguards so good for families. The water in the round pool is extremely cold but we ventured (just keep swimming !!). Great bar service and such a nice way to spend an afternoon before entering the Vegas nightlife. We saw Rod Stewart and he was fabulous and loved the fact it was five minutes walk from our room !! This hotel is fantastically located and would go there again for certain.
50,My trip to Vegas was amazing! Once we arrived at Caesar's it was just luxury upon luxury. As soon as you walk in you can either stand in line to check in or go to one of the kiosk on the side for a quick and convent process. We did both because we weren't sure if we had done it correctly(we thought something went wrong because we received our room keys early and did not want to be charged extra which we were not). The workers at the front desk quickly ensured that we had checked in correctly and would not be charged a fee(which was great!).  Our room was on the 23 floor right above the pool and just GORGEOUS! We had a double bed room with a great view of Vegas. The pool or should i say pools were just as amazing this resort does everything BIG. There are several pool to choose from (no need to bring towels they provide you with them) and there is a refreshment bar as well as a regular pool bar. The casino is vast but that is what you expect when you are in Vegas. The food is great the greatest buffet in Vegas is located in this resort and is fabulous the food court is great as well. The food court has foods for just about everyone and provides just about every type of dietary need including Halal and Kosher. Near the food court is Lisa Vanderpumps Bar/Restaurant which was a great experience too but heads up it is expensive so check the menu before you go if this maybe an issue. The best part about staying at Caesar's Palace was that it is apart of the Forum mall. If you are a shopper and enjoy high end stores such as Versace Louis V. Chanel this is the place to stay at. They do have some moderate priced shops but they are mostly makeup or beauty store such as Sephora and MAc. There are also places to eat inside the Forum as well like Maggiano's and Cheesecake Factory. Night life here is great too and there are multiple bar's/ lounges that have music at night (especially on weekends). These are all free or are included if you have a players card and if you are a girl you get into the club for free before 1am (depends on the time of year and day). Just be ready for the whole place to be very crowed on the weekend. Over all my stay at Caesar's Palace was perfect and it really felt like I was staying in a palace.
50,Hadn't been to Las Vegas in many years. Had a wonderful time at Caesar's Palace. Great amenities good food plenty of gambling action as well as other entertainment choices. Everyone was very helpful and courteous. Can't wait to go back!
10,Checked in at the Diamond Registration to find the next cutback of taking the coffee away from their Diamond Members. Also the Diamond lounge computers were not working for the last 2 years and still not working.
50,I really had a good time at cesar palace along with my family and friends that‚Äôs an experience that I‚Äôm for sure want to due again I definitely recommend it to any body that wants to have a really good time
50,The place is very well kept. The playing atmosphere is great. You feel that you belong there..  The hotel is located right on the perfect area. Good place to shop for new things.  Nice area to go for a walk and enjoy other attractions.
50,We had such a great time in Las Vegas and staying at Caesars made our vacation even more enjoyable. The rooms are beautiful and very clean the pool is stunning and the employees were very helpful and courteous. We would definitely stay at Caesars LV in the future.
50,Oh my gosh could this place by any more beautiful? And so many things to do and lots of slots. Hung out at pool. It was a little cold but it was 110 outside so it didn‚Äôt matter. Recommend 100% percent.
50,Stayed at Hilton Grand Vacation Club but experienced a full range of activities. Lots to do great casinos easy to travel via Uber. Steakhouse at Caesar's was awesome...best steak ever!! So glad I found it!
50,I have seen at Caesars Palace now two times and they beat my expectations this visits even more than the last time. The place is spotless and beautiful. The service is phenomenal 5 star. We were lucky enough to get a strip view Room which was phenomenal. Hands down this is the best hotel in Las Vegas. Maybe even in the whole world.lolüòÅ
50,From the good porter beef cut to the blue scotch. To the dance at omnia to the grate view and drink at the hiroller.  To the water fountains show from my bedroom to the glorious pool where I rest from life course.  To the good poker game with an aromatic whiskey to a good cigar from Cuba.  Ceasars palace has my kind of happiness and beyond.  I‚Äôm happy and stay happy programming my next trip than promise to be glorious.
50,Okay ... so here we are at Caesars after checking out of Palms Place because it was filthy and disgusting! We waited in line for an hour to check in and were greeted by Zandra who was so sweet friendly and understanding of our circumstances! She gave us 5 star treatment and is the kind of employee that makes me want to come back and stay at Caesars every time I am in Vegas! üíólove Caesars!
30,Beautiful hotel quick chatting service easy kiosk check in/out  even TV Guest service check out fast üëç. But no complimentary water ?! Las Vegas I‚Äôve known 15 years ago was now gone. No free coffee no cheap foods in hotel ( eating outside hotel would be heaps cheaper) everywhere asking for ID before selling !!! Hotel didn‚Äôt even provide beer opener we were advised to buy one outside ! The Bell desk didn‚Äôt control well. My luggage delivered by airline later Bell desk services told me they didn‚Äôt receive it yet . Luckily I spotted my luggage right next to the service desk !!!
30,location of our room was the furthest from the one elevator location in the entire tower.  the shower was clogged and we wasted about an hour getting it fixed. Was locked in the bathroom because the lock was broke. The smell of Marijuana was seeping into our room. Didn't have any services back to the airport. Considering all the money spent there the amenities were slim
50,Didn‚Äôt stay at Caesar‚Äôs but always love playing in the casino and the variety of slots provided. We also enjoy the food court for a quick bite and strolling through the mall. Highly recommended a visit here!
50,Visiting Caesars Palace was an amazing experience both for adults & kids. We walked to every corner possible but still had much more to offerWe will definitely visit again and have a greater experience.
40,We expected to be treated better. For the price. Poke was served in tiny plastic cups and had hac not been marinated with no add ons dull. Ceviche also had not been marinated and was probably unsafe.
50,We enjoyed a fabulous 3 night stay in the Julius Towers on the 6th floor.  Our room was very spacious with a king bed and a large bathroom with huge shower.  Lifts were right in the casino so we could be in our room and down into the casino in less than a minute!  Location was the best!  As a lot of reviews state you do not need to even leave Caesars if you do not wish however would definitely recommend checking out other casinos and taking a walk down the strip.  The Bellagio fountains (less than a 5 minute walk from Caesars) were amazing! Make sure to watch day & night.  Overall enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend.  Only con is a very slow check in service check out however was simple as we could check out on our tv in room.
10,Great location great hotel rooms magnificent pools but the services bring everything down....    Concierge service is not friendly at all when I asked the gentleman to arrange the shuttle bus from the hotel to the airport he suggested me to use Uber/Lyft instead then I told him I talked to another guy before I was told to come back the day before check-out to book the shuttle bus $9 per person then he called for us I felt like we forcing/harassing him to do something not on his 'willing to do list'....    Long story short there is no scale in the whole hotel...... house keeping told us there is no scale in the hotel there would be one at the Bell Desk but we have to bring our luggage downstairs to weight but the guy at the Bell Desk told us whoever told us was wrong - 'I told you 4 times we don't have a scale here and I have been working here for 16 years' the front desk manager Conrad told me it must be a misunderstanding he ordered a regular/bathroom scale sending to our room 30 minutes later we called the house-keeping again the lady verified there was a request from somebody but the house-keeping department couldn't find any scale.... she kept apologizing.    It is very impressive there is no such a thing called 'scale' 'regular scale' or 'bathroom scale' in a 4.5 star hotel in Las Vegas strip with 4000 rooms. I just couldn't believe that. I will never stay in this hotel again unless I know there is at least 1 scale available in this hotel. What a joke!
50,Excellent Hotel ‚ù§Ô∏è I love to stay always there the August Tower is amazing the mall casino restaurants shows the pool is great if you want to have a great time in Las Vegas you should stay at Caesar‚Äôs Palace Hotel ‚ù§Ô∏è
50,beautiful and spacious rooms. lots to do on property. very centrally located to everything. restaurants were great and the gaming area was good as well. the clientele was a lot better than many other hotels on the strip. can't wait to go back
40,Just gambling there but had a good time nonetheless. Service staff were helpful and enthusiastic . Easy to get to different games and distinguish between different prices. Enjoy the marketplace area in the shops as well.
40,"Why would anyone stay in Caesars' with a toddler you might ask? Good question. However it was our first trip to Vegas with a baby and I had a five day conference to attend to so it seemed the easiest way to stay in the event's hotel.    The hotel room pricing for conference visitors doesn't make sense unless you look at it from Caesars' point of view. It was 200 dollars per night without pool/gym access. We had friend with us staying in her own room and we switched her to a room booked via hotels dot com website because that was 100 dollars per night with pool/gym access! Caesars sure does seem to make a nice profit from conference visitors' stay in the hotel room.    Our room was okay. I understand they want people to use the overpriced restaurants and coffee shops in the Caesars premises so the fridge in the room is locked off and it can't be used for your own purposes like storing food for kids. Oh well!    Walk 10 minuted to the Forum and grab Starbucks coffee for couple of dollars less than right next to the slots.    The pool was perfect for a family visit and it was our second living room for several days.    If you don't know how your kid will react to the lights and mayhem at the casino downstairs I recommend staying in some other hotel. Google for ""kid friendly Vegas hotel"" to get recommendations. Our toddler had trouble getting his daytime naps with all the chaos around him. Eventually we found a rhythm but hot Vegas was a lot of work when traveling with a toddler and staying at Caesars."
40,I stayed at Caesar‚Äôs while attending a business meeting there. My room was quite large with plenty of light working space and a large bathroom. The property is huge with a lot of casino areas as well as shops restaurants and bars. Smoking is allowed on the property and although the ventilation is pretty good I was still exposed to smoke from people walking by and sitting around me. They offer a $10 credit if you don‚Äôt want your room cleaned. Upon check in they said that the credit would be applied to your hotel bill against any restaurant or bar charges on the property. Well upon check out I didn‚Äôt have the credit on my bill even though I took the option and had to have the front desk clerk adjust the bill appropriately. So check your bill carefully when checking out of the hotel. The hotel does have kiosk stations for express check in and check out but the front desk clerk is still needed to make any adjustments. Resort fee is $45 per night so be aware that that is an extra charge plus taxes onto the room rate. A hamburger in their lobby restaurant will cost you $45! A glass of 4oz wine will cost $15.
40,Great Location this is kinda in the middle of everything. My family enjoyed the stay there. The Pool was amazing. The Food Court had many options. OMNIA Club was a great experience but super crowded.
40,We were going to a concert at Caesar‚Äôs so we decided to stay here as well. Rooms are very clean modern and spacious. Comfortable beds. Customer service was excellent during our entire stay. My only comment (and I know this is the way of life in Vegas) is the high costs for everything at Caesar‚Äôs. They give you a Keurig coffee pot in the room but if you want a couple of k-cups it‚Äôs $13. All items in the room and fridge are all on pressure sensitive pads. Move one for more than a few seconds and your charged. And of course there are no prices anywhere in the room to tell you what any of costs. When you go to the gift shop it‚Äôs the same. Not a single item has a price on it. You get the surprise when you go to buy it only. Just seems a bit deceiving and nickel/dime approach. Still... a beautiful place to stay. Just bring your wallet.
50,Best hotel on the strip so very safe. Lots of ambience so many fun machines to play and great venues for eating. It is my favorite go to destination. I always get a quick bite at the pizza place in the food court area it is delicious. One slice can actually feed two but on those days when your extra hungry get a slice all to yourself.
50,We had a fantastic stay at Caesars. We go to Vegas every year for a week and Caesers is by far the nicest. The rooms are big with great views and the bed and pillows are extremely comfortable. Caesers offers many restaurants shopping spa pools hot tubs night clubs bars. Very clean and best location at center of the strip.
50,Always fun playing at Caesars. The front table area under the Rotunda brings back great memories  of the Rat Pack days and the importance of Caesars on the Strip. Most of the dealers are super friendly but some of the pit bosses need some personality. Overall great time.
50,Room was fabulous in the Octavian tower though it was a hike to get there. Valet parking was chaotic and very frustrating. Casino was to crowded to enjoy which forced us to gamble elsewhere. The nice room wasnt worth the trouble.
50,Love the bathroom size and all employees are kind. They are very fast to respond my needs. swimming pool water was kind of cold I guess it‚Äôs a Vegas desert üåµ. It‚Äôs a quite nice place to stay for your journey. I would come back and stay here next my vacation.
50,We stayed in a suite in the Augustus Tower room was very nice and clean. The spa is top notch and the staff are all above par! There is a lot of walking because it is quite large if you don't want to walk much stay downtown. We love this place so much we named our dog Caesar!
40,Rooms were perfect overlooking pool! Great resturant selection. Drink service on casino floor could be better. Overall experience was good went with two other couples to concert venue which was great.
50,The best las vegas has to offer is at the ceasers palace. From the best shows food store ect. I highly recommend you visit this location once during your travels. Me and the fellas find this to be the best spot for sports gambling they have a nice lounge with sports to watch for days. I highly recommend this beauty.
50,Love Vegas and staying at Caesars traveled with my grown adult sons and their friends and my husband. Stayed in Octavius Tower newly renovated and beds were super comfy. The pools are quieter which we liked and actually won money on the slots. Great restaurants you really don't have to leave casino but you should.
50,I love Caesars I can't wait until i get to stay there only been in the casino and had good luck both times.We love the NUMB bar it has great Cocktails and Gordon Ramsey's The Pub is one of the best places to eat.We stop there everytime we come to vegas
50,Excellent service!! The property was beautiful and great. I will be visiting this property again real soon. The casino tables were nice. The dealers was very courteous and knowledgeable about the tables games.
50,Clean rooms great sport place to watch football games and great food on premises the staff was helpful when needed come to Vegas about 4 times a year and always enjoy visit and there is always a lot of activities to enjoy .
40,great place to stay in the middle of Vegas and everything is within walking distance(nightlifegreat shows shopping and fabulous restaurants) also very good customer service from all staff members to help you.
20,A colleague that was with me apologized to me about the service he witnessed me receive. It made for an incredibly awkward encounter. I hope it was a one off incident and not a regular occurrence I used to have fond memories of staying at Caesars.
50,Caesars Palace spare no cost when it comes to their hotel rooms. Love it and recommend it to anyone.  Staff were great. Love restaurants shops and atmosphere. Have stayed here several times and brought my family. We all loved Caesars
50,It was a great stay friendly staff beautiful clean room and a great location on the strip. They have plenty of food options from high end to a more casual food court area and a great buffet. They also have a nice sportsbook and plenty of slots and table games with friendly dealers.
20,We stayed at Caesars at the beginning of September. At checkout there was a $60 valet parking charge. We had no car at the hotel and this charge was taken off the bill by the front desk before leaving. One week after leaving the $60 charge was put back on our credit card. The charge is from Caesars. They will take no responsibility and want us to dispute the charge with the valet or credit card company. This was an unauthorized charge on our credit card by Caesars. The manager Cynthia H. is unwilling to do any investigation and claims they have no responsibility for this charge.
50,The room was very spacious and had everything you could want (walk in closet jetted tub etc). We had everything you could possibly want in our hotel and didn‚Äôt need to leave if we didn‚Äôt want to. You will not be disappointed if you booked a stay here!
50,Caesars Palace is our go to resort when visiting Las Vegas. The rooms and bathrooms are pristine (ask for extra towels when you arrive). The restaurants on location are delicious and Caesars is central to all the action on the strip. We are always pleased with the hospitality and responsiveness of the staff. Qua Spa is one of our favorites. Shout out to Jay in Diamond Registration for making our party feel welcomed and accommodated. When you feel welcomed during registration it makes the beginning of your trip that much more enjoyable with all the hustle and bustle of the city going from airport to resort.
40,Huge and beatiful casino although did not think to visit this casino iy was because a show that was there is like a mini city you will need time to enjoy all the facilities also would be great to stay in yhe resort to really enjoy all the amenities everything was  Great.
50,"We had a family reunion in September and end up staying for 4 nights at the Hotel. We had the opportunity to have a good breakfast at the ""Cafe Americano"" Great Service. and food We also had dinner at Homestead Steak house where food was Delicious and the service was excellent. Nice clean rooms."
50,Caesars is a great place to stay. They have clean rooms and the property have a lot of amenities including shows great dining options and of course great gambling options. I would highly recommend this property to anyone going to Vegas
50,Love my Experience at the Caesars Palace ..... Food  Shops Gambling and the Pools ! Rooms are up to date and Spotless. The Beds have the most comfortable and pillows to die for!  Great location and ease of axcess to the strip.
30,I was so excited to be staying at Caesars Palace. However excitement quickly faded when I learned that the entire place (and all other properties managed by Caesars) did not carry my brand of beer (Michelob Ultra) nor Diet Cokes (Pepsi products only). These were not available in the gift shops bars casino or restaurants. I was hoping there would be no need to go to other casinos to play if we didn't want to. However we went offsite to eat and gamble. Take advantage of checking in and out at their kiosks or online lines were very long and slow.
50,We really enjoyed our stay at Caesar‚Äôs. Our room was quiet and roomy.The location is convenient to shopping and restaurants. The employees were attentive and friendly the food was excellent everywhere that we ate the gym was awesome and the pool and poolside service was amazing! Would definitely recommend this hotel.
50,Maid service was exceptional. Front desk was also very helpful. Not very lucky with gambling. The steak house was very good a little pricey but the food was delicious. Sports bar was entraining but the price of beer takes away from the experience. I betting on ponies games and playing video blackjack and I didn't get 1 free beer. I guess I am leaving in the past when alcohol was comp.
50,Room was great! The food and service was excellent. Everything and everyone very nice. Really enjoy everything at Caesar‚Äôs and always stay there when we visit Las Vegas. Caesars is the best venue on the strip.
50,I stay for four Nights at the Caesar Palace initially I had a bad experience with my check in. Omar was the staff that complete my check in around midnight and his service was horrible. Jose Ramirez was the manager that night and he was ok but he didn‚Äôt do nothing to solve my situation that night. In the other had next day I talk to the concierge Ivy and she was ready nice. She recommended me go to the front desk and talk to a manager. When I get to front desk this time was Kristen and she was very open to listen my complain and move diligently to try to bring a solution. She put me in contact with Ray the manager and he also listen to me and apologize for the inconvenience plus was able to give me options to make my stay feels better. After this situation everything run smoothly in my stay. We use the spa one day and it was amazing the beds are super comfortable and the restroom is beautiful nice water pressure also. The hotel have fantastic pool area. I try food at Mesa restaurant that was really good for lunch. I will definitely stay again at Caesar Palace. I want said special thanks to Ivy Kristen and Ray you are an excellent example of Top Quality of Customer Service. To Omar and Jose Ramirez keep working in your customer service skills you have a lot to improve. Until my next stay was in Vegas! This was a happy ending staying overall after all.
40,Great location for a conference The setup of the conference area is very easy to get. The rooms are well kept and service is great. Overall a great experience. I would come back not just for business but personal vacation also.
50,The people are what make Ceasars Palace the best place to stay in Vegas. Richard and Rick in the Diamond Lounge make the trip fun. Plus there are to many other people to name. If you need a great host I highly recommend Joan Chase.
40,Great hotel. Location is awesome. Easy to access the whole strip. Rooms are a very good size. Best brunch Buffett in Vegas. Tables are friendly. Lots to do within the property. The habitat retreat is very nice.
30,Since this is such a large hotel it would have been more welcoming if the person that checked us in would have offered a map of the hotel and other information regarding the surrounding area or at least directed us to that information.
50,"Did not stay at Caesars Palace but stayed at Harrahs. Did see a show at  Caesars ""Jeff Foxworthy"" which was great. It was in the Palace Ballroom. all the seats there are great.  Also went to the Diamond Lounge and had a drink. There always seemed to be a line waiting to get in."
50,All awesome I don't think I would stay anywhere else. The service is great the staff is the best I've seen around the strip. I always felt welcome wherever I went in the hotel or the casino. Keep up the great work.
50,Excellent service from start to finish. Everyone in the Diamond lounge check in was great and very accommodating. Restaurants are phenomenal and the rooms are spacious and clean. We will always stay here first when we visit Vegas.
50,Caesars Palace is an excellent choice in Las Vegas. The beautiful rooms shops and pools are amazing. Mehret assisted us when checking in. She is the best. She is helpful and gave us grand accommodations.
50,The service is great. The Bed in the room was the best. Very clean from top to bottom. Always a great stay. From gaming to food to cocktails. And some of the best shows. A little bit more money but worth it.
40,Caesar's Palace is a beautiful today as it was years ago. The cost of pancakes and a cup of coffee is over $35.00 with a tip - the cost fir bottled water on average is $7.00 for a bottle that costs you about 8 cents in Costco. Prices are ridiculous and highly unnecessary. Just when you think its over and go to check out the daily resort fee will cost you about $47.00 per day. What is a resort fee? Didn't they charge enough just for the room itself. By the way the buffets that Vegas is famous for is a good one at Caesars but will cost you an average of $50.00 PP for lunch and more for dinner.    Don't put anything in toe hotel minibars - on tip of everything else Caesars will charge you $75.00 per day for the use of it.    With prices like this its no wonder that Rome fell!!!
50,Hale Caesar I loved everything about staying at caesars palace everything you can want and have is at this one hotel and action packed casino we‚Äôre the slots I played won! The pool breath taking the shopping amazing
50,Excellent choice of gaming! Quick with drinks. Tons of amenities. One of the best places to stay in Vegas. Forum shops are to die for. Everything you could imagine under one roof! Superb location. Friendly staff!
50,We had a good time at Caesars! The fact that they matched my Platinum status that I have with Wyndham was a BONUS!! FREE PARKING AT EVERY CAESARS LOCATION! Truly a great experience! We can't wait to go back to have some fun! Oh yeah the Buffet and Spa are the best on the strip!! A MUST! TIP: Check Groupon for Buffet deals!
50,I loved my room my location Octavius 58th floor beautiful goddess pools view perfect furniture beautiful art on walls mini bar perfect air I loved it the casino is huge met lots of friendly people from all over the states and out it states.
30,Nice amenities but expensive. Great food options and the suites are well appointed and clean Gaming was tough this trip. Machines tight. My host was excellent as always. Montecristo cigar bar is a place to check out.
50,Our stay was awesome!!! We were in a suite which was very roomy clean and very well decorated. We chose to take the go green option so we did not have daily room service and were given extra towels to meet our needs
50,Great service and overall stay. Fabian at the check in desk did a phenomenal job and ensured we were happy with the stay. He managed to waive our early check in fee and upgraded us from the Octavius to the Palace which made it very convenient to pool access. Resort is in the middle of the strip.
10,"I just cancelled my upcoming reservation to this hotel because I was told the ADA Compliant wheelchair accessible rooms have a 30"" high bed. I asked if anything could be done to lower it and have spent almost 3 weeks going back and forth with the hotel trying to see if they could accomodate me. Most wheelchair users would expect to be able to transfer into a bed averaging anywhere from 20-24"" I really don't feel 30"" is acceptable and it was not advertised. Imagine my horror upon arrival if I had not asked in advance. I would not have been able to get on the bed. The lack of communication at all levels was disheartening. The reservation person who was helping me emailed several managers more than once only to be ignored. I called the Palazzo who also has high beds in their accessible rooms (28"") they immediately sprung into action and have secured me a room with the promise of removing the bed frame to drop the bed back down to an acceptable transfer height. It was like day and night between hotels. I thought I would post this to help others trying to find a wheelchair accessible hotel room in Vegas that isn't going to shock you when you wheel in the door."
50,Did not stay at the hotel...just visited. The pool area looks awesome had a cigar and drink at the cigar bar which was fantastic and the live music at Cleopatra's Barge was great! Would consider staying here on our next trip for sure!!!
40,Caesar‚Äôs is huge. The casino is bright and loud compared to some other casinos. The slots are tight. The room was very comfortable and quiet. Charged for everything: parking resort fee coffee maker but charged for coffee refrigerator but charged for personal use. Restaurants and food court well located. Searsucker is a great place for Happy Hour. Check in was smooth and check out was done on the TV. Parking entrance isn‚Äôt as smooth or calm as say Harrah‚Äôs; here is crowded and just doesn‚Äôt seem as smooth.
50,Check in was a breeze with Elpidio. He works hard to make sure you get a nice room and is a super nice guy too. We got the standby upgrade to the Augustus Tower. Room was beautiful and had a jacuzzi tub that was awesome after a long day on the strip. Room was very quiet and the beds are super comfortable. Parking was free with our player's card so that was nice. Casino has a really nice sports book with large screens with the best picture I saw our whole trip. Caesar's is our go to Vegas hotel and I can't wait to go back!
50,Love the double bathrooms. Huge shower and tub. Very clean and spacious room. Pool was fun. Great views. Lots of shopping.  Fun place to stay. Wonderful food. Helpful and friendly employees. Hope to go again soon.
30,We did the kiosk check it. It said we would receive an email when our room was ready two hours later we decided to go back to the check in counter as we hadn‚Äôt heard anything and found out there was a room available so don‚Äôt understand why we didn‚Äôt get the email. since we had left our bags with the Bell Hop while waiting for the email to check in and return to retrieve our bags. This turned out to be very confusing for the staff because we wanted to take the bags ourselves to our room as we had tickets to an early show and didn‚Äôt have a lot of time. We still had to wait 15 minutes for them.    The room is nice we were in the ‚Äúnewly renovated‚Äù Augustus Tower but the paint is peeling and bubbling on the ceiling in the bathroom. There‚Äôs a Keurig in the room but if you want coffee you have to pay extra as it‚Äôs part of the mini bar. If you want to put something of your own in the fridge you will be charged a $75 fee to use the fridge.    On our next visit we will definitely be looking at alternative accommodations.
40,Good fun and friendly the atmosphere was envigerati go and play slots and celebrate at ceasars good fun and great restaurants and lounges the sports area is alive and very fun and the table games are as well
10,"I recently booked a one night stay for the Julius Royal Duplex Suite ($1600/night) with a connector 1 Bedroom suite ($190/night). Thing is Caesars insists on charging an additional resort fee of $44.22 on a CONNECTOR ROOM that their website advertises as an optional extension to the Julius Royal Duplex Suite. I just contacted the hotel and spoke with a manager by the name of Hector who insist that they will not waive the BS resort fee on the CONNECTOR ROOM even after explaining that I'm already paying about $1800/night after taxes with them plus the 10 Group Rooms that I'm working with the group dept on he still insists on NOT WAIVING that BS resort fee on an ADD-ON room that ALREADY connects to the Duplex Suite.    He BS explanation ""Well you turned a One Bedroom Penthouse Suite into a Two Bedroom Penthouse you have to pay the resort fee on the additional room..."" how greedy!!!    You may be thinking ""wELL eVeRyOnE pAys A rEsOrT fEe..."" true and I try my best to avoid them but please consider what other fees Caesars Palace is trying to cash out on:    - Parking $24/day  - Housekeeping Fees $15/day (This giant Penthouse doesn't even include housekeeping)  - Keurig Coffee Station in Room (It's already in the room yet $13/cup!)  - Store your birthday cake and sandwich platter in our fridge fee - $9.95 each item    Yet this BS place can't waive a $39 + TAX ($44.22) resort fee for an extra bedroom add-on for my Penthouse suite that appears to be billed for basic services a la carte style.    Seriously considering cancelling my reservations and pulling my group from this nickel and dime hotel."
40,We stopped a few nights in September when we got there checkin was hard work the que was about half an hour long and the rooms weren‚Äôt ready until 6pm we were not told of this and made us late for a meal we had booked    The hotel has everything at any hour and is very clean perfect location on the strip and can walk to a lot of places from it  We got sun loungers round the pool both time we visited  They do need to look into access to the rooms as we were followed to our room one night by a man asking for money
10,Really expensive the main pool was freezing and I couldn‚Äôt even go in it. Starbucks was extremely more expensive than even Beverly Hills for the exact same order. The pool bathroom was out of order and the other one has sinks out of order. No free water bottles provided in the rooms. Coffee in the room wasn‚Äôt free despite machines there.
50,Very good size and clean room the Octavian Tower is a bit farther away from the main area but it's a great walk especially after eating. The check in desk was very nice to change our room because the originally assigned room was very smoky. It was obvious someone smoke inside but the room was supposed to be NO smoking room. The Cafe Americano was convenient for breakfast with coffee at just $2.25. Meal prices are reasonable for being in the hotel. Very happy with hotel location and there's enough to do nearby for our short stay of three nights. Best part was the Rod Stewart concert is in the same hotel and need not fight the strip traffic afterwards.
50,fabulous hotel and casino. shops are great as well. Luxury at every corner. Not overly crowded. Felt very safe and secure. Employees are friendly & knowledgable. The casino is a lot of fun. Has a variety of games to play.
50,Loved it! My first time at Caesars and I can‚Äôt rave enough about it. We got an upgrade to the newest tower the view from our windows was incredible and I have never seen a more stocked mini bar! Oh and the room had a jacuzzi tub!!
50,Friendly staff and good room service . Everything was clean and easy to get to  shops were very clean and the staff were very friendly . Room was very clean and did a non smoking room and it didn‚Äôt smell like smoke
50,I was visiting for my birthday and the man I checked in with made my time in vegas incredible! He gave me an amazing room in which I was over the moon about and had amazing customer service skills! Thank you Ralph for making the vegas experience one to remember! Thank you!
50,I‚Äôve had the best experience here!  Wilfred and Sofia made our stay even better they helped us out tremendously when we were just trying to get a room because we were staying down at the strip all day living in Henderson and we thought that it‚Äôs more convenient and safer to stay at the strip and so we went in to check the rates and these people were amazingly helpful we ended up staying for a while just talking and they literally made our day! LOVE everything about this place!
50,Caesars is generous with mail offers for free hotel and show tickets so Caesars is our go to hotel when we go to Vegas. We end up gambling away more than we would have paid but that is part of the fun. Caesars rooms are outstanding the hotel and casino staff are professional and helpful. Sometimes its a little crowed during peak times but that makes for good people watching so all is good. Overall love Caesars palace.
10,Usually with a resort and the extra fee you can count on a good bed mattress was soft and lumpy. I wanted to check in one hour early I understand if the room was not ready but it was and they wanted an extra 45 bucks! In addition to get the Keurig coffee pods in the morning plus a small tiny bottle of water are you going to pay additional $20 and that‚Äôs not room service! If u want to use the fridge in the room for your own drinks or food that will cost you $75. Room was very dated. Small issue but no que tips or cotton balls. When paying over 300 for a room plus a 42. Resort fee. I have a higher expectation. Finally they changed me for items in the room I did not use when I told them they promptly took care of it so check your bill!!
50,The rooms are clean roomy and tastefully decorated. The place is huge so it takes a while to get your bearings. They have a few pools so there is no line to wait in. There‚Äôs a food court as well as many restaurants. My only suggestion is to maybe put a map of the property in the rooms so people can navigate their stay.
50,A stunning building beautiful architecture paintings and statues. Clean gambling area. An absolute treat to visit. Right in the heart of the strip. Will certainly be returning when we go back to Las Vegas.
40,We had a great time. If it wasn't for the missinformation that we got when checking in with environmental friendly cleaning that was supposed to be each second day for a discount of 10 dollars that ended up with 3 days without any cleaning the hotel would have got a clean 5 in the review. Very cool place overall.
50,Caesars Palace is a Wonderful hotel to stay in. They explained all their programs immediately to us when we checked in and made our stay stress free for my son his new bride and our family! We will Definitely book Caesar's Palace for our next stay in Vegas!
40,Wish Caesars Las Vegas would have taken my comp offers from the Harris in New Orleans. I thought when I got there they would hook me up. Instead they offered me a free drink which you can get anyway while you are gambling.
40,Located direct in Las Vegas Strip where many shows and concerts are located. Rooms very spacious and had a good view of the Strip. WiFi is free but limited to 2 devices per room. Access to the pool they were already closed at 6 pm and is very crowded. In the room there was no info about the facilities of the hotel or any dining suggestions no info at all.
50,Thought it would be out of my price range - but it wasn‚Äôt! Awesome room and the best Casino in Vegas. Vintage Vegas. You have to stay here....It is in the center of the strip so it is the perfect place to stay.
50,stayed at augustus towers very friendly and helpful we are diamond members and love the shows and buffet very convienent to all other properties and fun and excitement to bad have to have extra points to go to diamond lounge should be able to get in with the diamond card and not have to have almost double points to go to the lounge
50,Very efficient checkin in and the girls at the desk were friendly and explained answers to questions we had thoroughly. Room was very clean and quite large and smoke free which was nice. Would definitely stay here again.
50,I've stayed and played at several locations in Vegas over the years however the Caesars properties continue to offer incredible diversity of choice in pools gaming facilities entertainment and affordability from The Flamingo to Caesars and the best shopping at the Forum Shoppes Caesars still delivers fun comfort and glamor!
50,We had a wonderful visit to Caesars. Our accommodations were great. As always the hotel was not a disappointment. The service was wonderful. The restaurants we ate at on the Total Rewards properties were fantastic. And finally our host Jennifer took extremely good care of us while at the properties. Looking forward to returning.
50,The building is very beautiful and extremely clean it was a wonderful and fun trip. I made last-minute reservations to come to Vegas alone to do some gambling and Caesars was very accommodating. Overall it was a great trip
50,The Augustus Tower was close to the front and was easily gotten to without a lot of walking. The room was large and the view was great. Room service was quick and good and Housekeeping did a great job for my comfort.
50,The hotel is centrally located on the strip. Easy access to lots of attractions. The swimming pool is amazing. The quality and variety of items on the buffet is a definite on my list when I return. New stores and restaurants in the Forum Shops area.
50,"Fantastic stay at Caesar's. Specifically the ""personal concierge"" is the absolute BEST thing ever. Thank you Ivy - my personal concierge - so easy to text and she is there immediately to help you out and answer any questions. Game changer - it will make me want to stay there all the time. Thank You!"
50,I recommend anyone to visit this resort. I couldn‚Äôt of been treated any better by the entire staff. They were all very welcoming. And want to mention that the slots actually played pretty good. I myself won a $4500.00 handpay. Food was fantastic. Little pricey but remember where you are. Overall a beautiful resort wonderful staff and will be returning next year!!
40,We always stay at Harrah's; this time we were a little disappointed with our 7 day stay. Hot water was always an issue. Maintenance was efficient in repairing what they could quickly: the safe hair dryer door lock. What was never fixed: the smell of cigarette smoke from the moment we entered and never went away. They did spray daily but it did not help.
50,front desk person went out of her way to make me happy also the dealers are always calling us by name as well as the pit bosses its a class hotel and would recommend anyone that is looking to choose a Total Rewards Hotel
50,Great location wonderful rooms and super friendly staff.would recommend staying at this location. Loads of entertainment great shows and just an overall fun place to stay with friends and family. I would highly recommend if you want a quick get away.
50,It was a pleasant stay at Caesars rooms is pretty clean no complain check in and out with out any issue. The Restaurant & Food inside the hotel was awesome. The good parts we come out of the hotel as a WINNER. You know what i mean.
50,I needed to stay an additional day due to concert day confusion. Employees worked hard to  be sure it worked out for me. Everyone was very attentive and insured that I had a good time.There was a confusion as to the date of the concert I was to attend and everyone worked very hard to be  sure the matter was resolved and that I could stay an additional day to see the concert.
40,Very nice place. Only stopped in for the afternoon. Lots of nice machines and not to overly crowded. Will definitely stop back. We had a sub in the food court and again it was a good sub with good service
50,We had a great time with family and friends. We will staying at the harrah's when we visit. There is always something do or see while in Vegas. There is still so much to see. We what to see more shows .
50,We visit Caesar‚Äôs annually for our guys trip (all in our 50‚Äôs).  We thoroughly enjoy the wide variety of restaurants sports watching gambling pool activities it has to offer. It feels like home! Actually better than home. That‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt miss it 15 years running.
40,Caesars was a lot of fun the employees were polite but not quite reaching out to go above and beyond.  Our room was nice not a great view.  The pool was clean and quiet.    We went to a few other casinos but caesars was our home away from home.
50,Harrah‚Äôs is a great entertainment resort offering everything you could need.. easy check in and out.. The hotel offers nicely appointed restaurants to enjoy with good service ..I‚Äôve been staying here for over 20 years
50,Emma was very accommodating right when we walked into the palace and even gave us a great value upgrade .  I couldn‚Äôt be happier with her service and patience as me and my friends struggled to make our way into Vegas.  10/10 service!
40,i would tell everyone they should stay here. been here twice now and have had a great time. Pools are great service is awesome. A place that I will always try to stay at. Very clean. Great people to be around.
40,I booked a standard room for 3 nights in advance and at check-in was invited to upgrade to a top floor suite for $100 per night.  My family had already arrived a few days before and were treated shabbily during check-in.  The check-in staff member bullied/insisted that my wife pay the resort fees for two rooms with two different cards when there was nothing wrong with the only credit card she had.  A formal written complaint was made the next day (she was in no mood to complain at the time due to a long time travelling from the UK) but nothing was done.  During check-out the situation was resolved. The hotel made an apology after my wife sent a further complaint via email following our return home from the trip.
30,Stayed at Caesar‚Äôs Palace for a week on business. Very busy hotel takes along time to get around as very spread out from bedroom to conference rooms. Bars and restaurants lots of choice also watched Rod Stewart which was a highlight. Casinos choices everywhere. Good gym but only opens at 6am. Bedroom functional and clean
50,We enjoyed our meals at the Bacchanal buffet and Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill. Would like to stay at this hotel on one of our future visits since there are so many things do see and do here. The casino area is HUGE and you could spend the entire day there to see all the beautiful statues and shops.
30,Resort fee and hidden parking fee are really discouraging. I‚Äôve been a frequent visitor of this hotel and casino for years but hate that you are starting to get gouged with these hidden fees. Just wait it‚Äôs a matter of time til they take away the free drinks.
50,I had a wonderful experience during the 16th of september weekend and was even able to catch a show!! It was during the Hispanic heritage weekend! My friend was able to obtain tickets to a Luis Miguel concert!
50,In my opinion Caesars Palace is the best locale and centre of excitement in Las Vegas. It is very close to early morning and late evening eats. Our room was always clean and inviting. As you know we have many choices of where to stay in Vegas but Caesars Palace always seems to be one of our final choices.
50,A clean hotel  great staff  amazing pools ! and for gambling they have a lot options  they have a nice food court but for me the best it's the sport books  you can.watch your game in big screen !t
10,My FIRST room was in the Forum Tower. It had nice amenities such as a button by the bed to automatically open the curtains and a tv screen in the bathroom. Nice.    Then I tried to open the bottom drawer to unpack my clothes. It was stuck. I finally jarred it open to find it STUFFED with crumpled USED towels packed so tight that it wouldn‚Äôt open all the way. As I began pulling them out several used BLOODY tissues popped out from between the linens.    Then I noticed the blood stain. On the toilet. Just above the handle I had just used which I had inadvertently TOUCHED.    Forget washing my hands. I ran to the shower. Full body decon. Then something caught my eye in the water stream. Embedded in the shower head was a curly human hair. I pulled it out with a rag before it came loose and sprayed onto my face. How would a hair get so firmly caught in a shower head I wondered. It was as though someone‚Äôs head had been rammed into it.    This room was now in my eyes a BIOHAZARD - if not a crime scene. I called the front desk and they offered to bring in a cleaning crew... I instead asked if another room was available.    They put me in a suite in the Julius Tower. Finally thinking things were back to normal I settled in and went to bed.    At 12:25 AM my bedroom light turned on. I groggily awoke. I slid open the partition to the other half of the room garbed in nothing but my unmentionables to find a FULLY CLOTHED MAN STANDING BEFORE ME! He was another guest toting his luggage and looking as shocked as I was...probably MORESO for did I mention - I was clad only in my unmentionables?! He stammered and said the front desk had assigned him this room. Then after staring at me for an uncomfortably long moment he mumbled ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just go now.‚Äù    At no point during my stay did any staff at any level seem to consider just how awful things could have gotten had either guest been in a different frame of mind. What if either party had been drunk and aggressive? What if instead of a man a female had been awakened in the middle of the night wearing HER unmentionables?    Caesars Palace dodged so many potential lawsuits that night. What did I get? A phone call at 12:45 AM from the front desk clerk just after I‚Äôd gotten back to sleep telling me their system showed my room as vacant and demanding to know how I got in. Then after all was sorted out ‚ÄúHopefully you‚Äôll have smoother sailing from here on.‚Äù
50,I love this place. Typically draws a younger crowd but al good. It‚Äôs a very lively casino with pretty architecture and things to do. The night club Omnia is amazing so check this place out when in town.
50,Great place clean good service lots things to do  diversity  fun  love Mexican party there  best place to celebreate beautiful pool nice Buffett  love Mexican music  real Mexican party üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
20,Every hotel employee was mediocre at best. I'll start with the good.    Location : it's very Central to everything. But so is the linq so... lol    Restaurants: So many fantastic options. You could eat most meals in the hotel including the buffet. However the service literally sucked everywhere we ate except Gordon Ramseys Pub. Go there. Food was amazing service was amazing.    The bad    Check in. I unfortunately was very ill on our first two days. I called from downtown where we stayed for a night requesting early check-in. The gentleman on the phone said no problem made the arrangements I just had to pay a small fee. However he did suggest that I probably still don't arrive until around 12 or 1 because the hotel was at capacity and I needed to get some rooms clean. I showed up at 1. No room. To no room. I did not get a room until 4:30. And that was only after I waited in line again for 30 minutes. It finally changed my room to a different Hotel Tower. I got my early check-in fee back.    Our friends were traveling with us and they booked an ADA room in the Octavious Tower.  Her bed was so high it literally reached my friends armpit who is in a wheelchair. His butt is touching the lower box spring. And when they called to ask about getting the bed lower. Or a room with a lower bed because he cannot get into the bed. They told him he would take care of it. Well we got back at 4 a.m. and the bed was not fixed. They told us his only option was to call the paramedics and they would put him into bed. And that we would have to call them again to get him out of bed in the morning. Like what?! ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨    And the next day the fire alarm is going off in our room it went off for 20 minutes. Police were knocking on all of the doors looking for something. When we popped our head out and asked if everything was okay he said yes it's fine and just to go ahead and go back into our room. When I open the door 20 minutes later a huge smell of gas filled our room. When I called downstairs and let them know what was going on they told me there was fire (duh) and that they could bring me an air freshener. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è5 minutes later I'm throwing up. We leave the hotel because I'm getting extremely sick. I call once outside and after sitting on hold they again tell me that there is no gas leak that this time it's a water leak. Their only option to me was to come back pack up our stuff and go to new room. Mind you the hotel floor were on HAS A GAS LEAK. By this time we're across the street and walking to go check out the high roller.    I could go on and on complaining about little issues. But these were bad enough.
50,As we go to Vegas often we try to stay here when possible. The rooms are luxurious and clean. The bedding is of good quality and the beds are comfortable. The only issue is the non clarity of elevator locations with elevators only going to certain floors etc. The rooms and Caesars itself are bright and very well maintained considering the number of guests. It is a place to be enjoyed.
40,Caesars Palace is a nice place to gamble. Did not stay at the hotel but we would like to in the future. It had a lot of activities going on involving loud music the weekend we went so it was pretty loud.
50,One of my favorite places to stay for now on anytime I visit Las Vegas I‚Äôm going to recommend it to all my friends and family My wife had an excellent time no complaints from her staff is wonderful hotel is beautiful nice clean in and out
10,This hotel is located in a great location which is what prompted me to select it as a top choice for my stay. After my first night I noticed that a couple of things were not working properly but then it took multiple calls to the front desk to have them addressed. However they were not able to fix it and it was just a pain to deal with when I expect a room to be fully functional. This was especially surprising since I have stayed at other top hotels with no issues. Even after upgrading the room to suite proved that this hotel is just run down and not in working conditions. Also I find it astounding that they charge a service fee per day when one day they did not clean my room until 4pm. So that being said if you don't care where you stay and just want a place to sleep at night then this is your hotel.
50,It was amazing and huge!! Great customer service!! We did not stay at this location while at Vegas but we will be Next visit! The entrance had the wow factor I found out we didn't even see all of caesars. It does look to be several blocks from outside.
50,The room was great but there were some details that made you feel a little bit like in a motel 6 like the fact that they provide a Keurig machine but charge you $13 dollars to use it that made it feel less of a luxury hotel and more like in a cheap motel. Augustus tower was very nice and the decorations were very well accomplished. The room was very clean and their signature scent is very nice and relaxing. Bathrooms are great oversized with jet tubs which is a very welcome amenity.
40,Enjoyed our stay staff was very helpful and courteous. Our room was very clean and comfy we.also had an excellent view. We had a good meal and also enjoyed the small coffee and snack cafe. The lady that did our registration went above and beyond in assisting us.
40,Everything was nice but can improve in outdoor cleanness but overall inside is good but a little power washing can improve out appearance.  But service is good and would definitely be back to play some more
40,The room was large with a great view of the pool area. It has all types of restaurants in the hotel/casino. Tons of entertainment locations...they even had Mariachi (for a special event) in the lobby. Great times.
40,As expected the property is top notch. Even forum tower which is next in line for a face lift has excellent rooms with super comfortable beds and bathrooms.    The casinos are extensive but always run on a higher minimum. Nothing against that however it would be nice to mix is up a little by dropping some table minimums early in the day and then popping back up in the evenings.    The resaurants in the hotel are just downright amazing.
50,We did not plan on going to Vegas until we saw that Eric Clapton was there for one night on his three city USA tour. I am a member of Caesar's rewards and reserved a king suite at a very reasonable price. The room was clean and comfortable. The staff was very accommodating. Caesar's has aged well and looks as nice as the day it opened in 1960's.
40,Very nice place huge lots of walking. Hidden costs after we checked out of our room though. We had already spent a fortune on eating & gambling. Was not too happy about it after spending so much money there.
50,Room was great. The only item I would suggest they improve on is how they rate you at the tables.  Every restaurant is fantastic.  Give the host more flexibility to give comps its seems like they are following rules all the time
30,Very disappointed with service. I have stayed many times and the service for even directions to the restrooms was rude. Couldn‚Äôt get a drink and it was a weekday! Hope I have a better time next month.
30,"I upgraded to Octavia Suite and they tried to charge me $129 a night instead of the $90 per night upgrade that was in their original offer communication. Eventually this was straightened out by the very nice front desk woman.    The room and service were great except for two troubling things:    We were at the pool on 9/15 and tried to order a drink at about 4 pm at the pool bar (which said they are open until 5 pm) Instead an incredibly RUDE bartender sniped at us and said: ""we have a big event tonight and have to get ready to ""you cant have any drinks."" We pointed out that the sign said they were open until 5 and he told my boyfriend ""well not tonight buddy."" RUDE!    And when i tried to use the express check out kiosk i was redirected by an employee to go to a particular line to check out. Once I got to the employee at the desk he told me that ""You are in the wrong line this is for key drop off."". When I said that i was directed to go in the line he said ""well i can help you this time but next time you need to wait with everyone else trying to check out. And he was VERY unfriendly. That kind of ruined it for me and I will choose another resort in the future because of this mistreatment. Mr Chow was great however and I highly recommend the restaurant."
40,The overall experience at Caesars palace was wonderful but a little overpriced. The tables seemed a little expensive and there were no penny games on the floor. The overall view of the casino and the pool area is very aesthetic. The buffet was great but not quite worth the price of $65 a person.
50,Just back from yet another great stay. Caesars hasn‚Äôt disappointed me yet and we‚Äôve been going here exclusively for 3 years now. Staff always fresh. Rooms are always good. Great restaurants shopping night life.
50,Caesars Palace was amazing! The casino shops bars it had everything you could ask for! One of the pools I visited was beautiful. We are already planning a trip back i a few month to stay on Caesars property.
40,After 15 hours of driving we pulled into Vegas about 6:30. The three of us got cleaned up and hit the evening Buffet then off to the slot machines and tables for about 45 minutes and then off to bed.? Buffett was an 8 and the beds and bedroom were a 8.5 and we got a good nights sleep and headed out in the early am.
50,The rooms looked like new the staff is always very courteous and friendly and as such Caesars is the only hotel my wife and I now consider after staying at many locations along the Las Vegas strip. All the amentities are top notch. All in all it is the best compared to the mulltiple other Hotels along the strip we have stayed at
50,Nice clean place. Great restaurants! Lots of variety! We always look forward to visiting! My only criticism is that no one ever came by to offer beverages. Not once! Still I would definitely visit again.
50,We stayed 2 nights and 3 days and we were very satisfied with amenities. Room service was excellent. Towels and bed sheets are clean. Shower is good. The room is well arrange. Air conditioning is very good.
50,Had a great weekend getaway at Bally‚Äôs and Caesars Palace for Mexican Independence!!! It was an awesome experience Vista Lounge is the place to be! The Luis Miguel concert at the colosseum was outstanding! Great sound  beautiful place!
40,Best place in Vegas to watch a game is the sports book at Caesars Palace! Monitors are numerous and very bright capturing all the action. Plenty of seating and bar space I would recommend this to anyone wanting to catch a game in Vegas.
10,I was playing music at my room 3pm security come over tell me many many was complain about it I put music low the show up at 4 pm again they tell me if they come over again the will have to remove me from my room I don‚Äôt pay almost 2k to be Uncomfortable I found a cucaracha by the coffe machine running around coffe cups they try to fix everything with a 50 dollars credit lol
20,First time staying at this hotel and was not impressed. Hotel is outdated rooms were not nicely decorated furniture in rooms was very uncomfortable and the hotel did not offer a lot of amenities. Will not stay here again and would not recommend.
40,Right near everything so the location was perfect. Staff were great. Super easy check in and out with kiosks although you had to go get keys at Front desk.  And love Hash House a Go Go! Our friends and family will love it when we come back for our wedding.
10,Firstly upon arrival you are left to figure out where on earth to park your car when you do figure it out you then have to walk for around 20minutes with all your luggage through an extremely busy and smoky casino. When you finally find the reception area you then have to stand in a long queue waiting to check in.  This hotel has the potential to be lovely but is over run with people and staff with a I don‚Äôt care attitude. It will cost you $75 just to open your bar fridge so don‚Äôt even attempt to store your water in there and be prepared to be just a number here. When checking out my husband and I questioned a charge of $200 on our bill we didn‚Äôt get any room service and had nothing charged to our room simply to be told by the reception staff ‚Äò I don‚Äôt know what your talking about sorry‚Äô.. so probably we are $200 out of pocket for reasons unknown. We travel a lot and can say we will never ever return here there are much better places to stay for cheaper. Our room was dated with tv cables hanging from the wall which is fine if you are paying $100 a night but when paying $400 a night this is a joke!!! If there is any confusion or muck up on your bill be prepared to never see that money again it‚Äôs a completely impersonal price gouging hotel who only care about money and obviously pay their staff minimum wage because clearly they don‚Äôt even want to be there... be warned!!!
40,Had a great time in Vegas with friends....but if were to choose a season I would never visit again in Summer...it was scorching hot so we just decided to stay indoor during the day...we enjoyed window shopping inside (lots of high-end brands/stores) and had great dining experience as well...check-in process took a little while but everything went well ...receptionists were all smiling esp.the Filipino crews...really hospitable and professional!
50,Had the most wonderful time at your place. Everything was beautiful and very clean. The luggage took 25mins to come to our room which I thought it was too long for a Monday. Otherwise all was great!! We will most definitely stay there again.
50,Thanks to Nayeli and David a trip that started off very rocky due to issues with our accommodations at the Linq was quickly remedied. If you are in Las Vegas Caesar‚Äôs Palace is the way to go. The other hotels do not invest the time in maintenance and the quality of their accommodations like Caesar‚Äôs does. We stayed one night at the Linq in a room that was dirty and wreaked of overpowering bleach cleaner smell. The carpets were stained and the sheets word. We moved over to Caesar‚Äôs and Nayeli and David assisted us in getting accommodations that were much more in line with our expectations that we could immediately check into. Great customer service and highly recommended! They truly turned our trip around and made it a positive experience!
50,Caesars is all class. I took my mom & aunt to go see Luis Miguel. My mom is handicap in a wheelchair. Everyone at Caesars went out of there way to make sure all was just right for her. When we arrive at the airport the Caesars limo driver was great he help with my mom getting in & out of the car. When we arrived at Caesars they had her wheelchair waiting for her. The bed in the room was to high for her so they sent a staff member and removed the box spring for her and was done in in less than 30 min. My wife booked a massage at the Qua Bath & Spa for my mom aunt & friend. The ladies all told me it was the best ever massage in life. The concert was great. I want to give a special Thanks to Mr. Roberto Ahedo the Caesars host that help set this all up. Roberto & everyone at Caesars made my mom and aunt feel like queens. Thank all of you at Caesars. I will be back to Caesars
50,For my 25th wedding anniversary my husband surprised me to a trip to Vegas. We stayed at the Caesar's Palace knowing it was the best a luxury classified as paradise by the gods. What we never could have expected was the generosity of Patrick. After mentioning our anniversary he congratulated us and told us to wait a moment. When he returned Patrick told my husband and I he upgraded our room. Our new Augustus suite gave us a view of the Las Vegas strip we had never seen making us feel like VIPs to our own adventure. Thanks to Patrick it was a beautiful start to our perfect trip.
50,The Caesars Palace casino is just amazing. It has so many amenities under one roof (including restaurants bars upscale shopping food court etc). It is conveniently located on the Strip and is walking distance to the Bellagio as well.    This casino is just more appealing as it is sprawling in nature and you can enjoy visits to night clubs like Omnia which is attached. Overall I didn't feel it was necessary to leave Caesars (only to see the other casinos which don't stack up as well ...except for the Bellagio and Cosmopolitan).
50,Caesars Palace is the best. It is my first choice in Las Vegas. The rooms and amenities are top of the line. The staff is very knowledgeable. Great experience from check in to check out. There are many fabulous restaurants to enjoy and the pool is amazing.
50,When you are in Caesars Palace Casino and Resort you have the feeling  of actually being in Rome with the Gods watching you ! The Augustus Tower Room where we  were accommodated for a week was splendid and beautiful - a Roman Motff all over !!!
30,I chose to stay in caesars palace as it was the conference venue. Since I heard that some of the rooms could be run down I chose to pay extra and stay in the Augustus tower - strip view. It was supposed to be a room that was renovated yet you can still see the run down furnitures - (they did not even bother to give it a new paint). All the towels were old. It felt like that they had been washed for over 10000 times - it was just like a cloth with no fluffiness. The room service was at most ok. I asked for slippers from the house keeping and I was told that i could not get any as they did not stock anymore. It is understandable of not providing slippers by defat yet I believe any 4-5 stars hotels should stock some to give it to clients who requested it. They actually suggested that I go down to their shop to buy it - which means they actually make them just not providing them. This is unreasonable as they are already charging over $250 per night. It is not too much to provide slippers to clients who requested them. In general the cafe and restaurants were expensive and yet the food was not exception. It will be recommended to go to guy savoy in Paris to have a meal than to eat it in las vegas.    This stay was a disappointment. The extra- pay is not worth it. Tor those who wants a better experience by paying a bit more i would recommend them to choose other newer hotels.
50,The place to stay in Vegas !! Excellent service and food. You have everything u ser one roof  do t need to go anywhere else  pool is awesome and nobu restaurant just out of this world  great great food 
50,Great Place with Endless Fun and Great Service. They go above and beyond to make your stay Great. This is the only hotel worth staying at with it having everything you need and much more right at the same location.
40,Room and amenities were great. Can‚Äôt complain. Restaurants were great as well. Atmosphere good as well. Choices for slot machines could be better and was evident by not too many people playing. Caesars I think is banking on the concert venue
50,We were invited to a blackjack tournament at Caesars and it a bit confusing. We were having trouble figuring out a situation with the room reservation (long story short we cancelled our room since we were local but found out we had to have one for the tournament). At any rate after being bounced around we ended up at guest checkin and Elpidio was able to call around and get everything straightened out for us and we were SO grateful. When I asked where I should leave a review this was where he asked.    Caesars should be thrilled to have such a proactive and friendly person working for them. Thank you Elpidio!!!!
40,Fun casino lots to see and do there. BUT DONT EAT AT CAFE AMERICANO. The food is way overpriced in the lobby restaurant/diner at Caesars. I like all the shops and the tables are fun but overpriced. Never even saw a $10 table. Pretty sure they were all never lower than $15 min bets which I know makes me sound like a cheapskate but come on for the average traveler that budget goes really fast. The bars are fun and the sportsbook is pretty great. But for the love of god do not eat in the restaurant/diner that is right in the hotel lobby. It was literally the worst value in all of vegas. I had breakfast: eggs sausage and hashbrowns (and the portions were all pretty small/standard) - and the price was $24. Twenty four damn dollars for the most basic breakfast. What a joke!!!
50,Mother-Daughter trip was a success. Caesars Palace is truly a palace. Great service from check in to check out. So much to do in this hotel. You don't even have to go out of this hotel during your stay. My daughter and I loved the Enrique Iglesias concert at the Coliseum - not a bad seat in the house. Enjoyed the wonderful buffet here. Food was amazing. Spa and pool experience was a much needed relaxing experience. We loved our stay at Caesars. We would give the hotel ten stars if we could.
30,Spent a week out there last year for my husbands 60th Birthday. Lovely hotel but looking a bit tired inside we were given a free upgrade in one of their exclusive towers and the room was huge but decor let it down. Really expected more from this hotel. We were here 30 years ago and I feel that the hotel trades on its name .
50,It‚Äôs not hard to see why this hotel is so famous throughout the world it is absolutely extravagant. It is a must see both externally and internally the architecture and attention to detail is unbelievable. Within the hotel there is masses to do from the 2 large casinos to the multiple restaurant and shopping outlets to the iconic swimming pools. Caesars is fantastic and a must see.
50,the room was excellent always clean  the location of the hotel is great  right in the middle of the strip  entertainment is always great security is always present  the ponly thing i did'nt like was not enough movies the local tv
50,Everything was exceptional except the pool was tooooo cold. I couldn't enjoy it with the Perfect weather of 100 f.they offers $10 credit for you stay if you decline to do the room daily but is not worth it because you have to call and waste you time just to request new towels.
50,Definitely visit Las Vegas Strip. Lots of shopsrestaurantsbarshotel and entertainment. Caesars Palace blew my mind what a beautiful hotel and the shops and restaurants are amazing. If you ever come to Vegas must stop at Caesars Palace.
40,Check-in was pleasant as Daniel Z did his best and more to make sure I was taken care of. He even upgraded me when he sensed that I needed something better than what I had booked. The room he gave me features a Jacuzzi and a view of the pools.    The pool area which is situated between the towers has 7 beautiful pools to choose from (actually 6. you can't choose the VIP pool unless you are a celebrity or very rich). Amazing food available and cute latin sayings etched onto the surrounding buildings with all the Romanesque architecture. The vibe is friendly as well. The only thing about the pools is that they are all only 4 ft deep. only two of them are heated. it surprised me that the water was that cold in the summer. But I guess that's what its like in the desert.
30,Rooms were clean and comfortable - but don't touch any of the snack items$$$$ Including the coffee  No refrigerator or microwave in room so you are forced to eat out. Don't bother bring any of the left overs back to your room unless you plan on eating them right away  Staff were helpful  Watch out for cost at restaurants
50,After a great stay 15 years ago our stay was even better this time around at Caesars Las Vegas. It felt completely new and our room in the Augustus tower was fantastic with a view of the fountains. The room was large and spotless and the beds were extremely comfortable. The location could not be better with many casinos and shopping within distance. The pool area was wonderful with the fountains and wonderful breeze blowing it felt so relaxing like a tropical Island feel. The mall attached to Caesars was beautiful just to walk through or grab a bite to eat at reasonable prices. Employees were all very friendly and accommodating and we would not hesitate to return.
50,2nd time staying at Caesars and booked the Augustus tower again with a view of the Bellagio Fountains. Rooms are spacious and beds are comfortable.    I arrived a few hours earlier than the scheduled check in time and the room I requested was not ready yet. The front desk agent was apologetic and offered alternatives but I insisted on waiting for the room type with a specific view. She then helped me have the housekeepers rush the room to be cleaned and called me as soon as the room was ready.    Augustus tower rooms are close to the lobby and the strip and you don‚Äôt have to walk thru the smokey casino to get to your room so I highly recommend to pick Augustus tower for the convenience.    Definitely will come again to this amazing hotel!!
50,Great experience.. from the checking valet to the check in for our room not ready customer service was very informative and advised on the next step with in less than an hour out was ready and our luggage was brought to our room with the kind as gentlemen who gave a lot of information about Cesar casino... would choose Cesar casino again
50,Caesars Palace is in a great location. It had a good selection of casino games and a lot of sight seeing and shops to choose from. There were a lot of ancient statues to see and take pictures of. I was really impressed by what I saw.
50,I had an awesome time on my birthday week. Thank you Cesar Palace for upgrading me to Diamond status. I recommend coming here for the hotel staff guest service and the hotel amenities. By far the best trip ever!!
30,Nice large room. Very comfortable. Bring your own coffee K-cups. Large bathroom with shower and bathtub. Bring an ice chest for your drinks and food as the refrigerator is not available for use except for mini bar items.
40,Rooms spacious clean updated and trendy. Pool side service was understaffed. Bar outside sports book lacked knowledge and service. Caesar‚Äôs is still one of the best because of location comps and beautiful rooms
50,We went to Caesars Palace while we were in Las Vegas and we had a blast. We were actually supposed to go to a Sports Bar but we ended up at a little bar on the corner at the casino and we had so much fun watching the football game. Caesar's Palace this absolutely gorgeous inside and outside. We didn't get a chance to eat at the Gordon Ramsay restaurant but maybe next time we will.
40,The Buffet was excellent and pretty much worth the money. They have a wide variety of food for all nationalities. One thing I would like them to provide is Alaskan King Crab legs. The casino area has mutiple gaming for every individual so big that if you don't pay attention to where your at you can easily gets lost in the place
50,I stayed in the Julius tower with an amazing view of the Bellagio fountain show. Also wanted to mention that Alex An from the host team and Wilfred from guest services were so helpful getting me acquainted to the property.
50,Very nice room with lots of room and good view. We always stay at Caesars and are never disappointed. Lots of choices on where to eat. Buffet is great with lots of selections. Nice quiet room with Jacuzzi.
50,The check in with Allurie was informative. She gave me all suite upgrade options and really sold me on a beautiful option with a premium view. The staff overall seemed happy and helpful. This was a one-night stay for my birthday and I was treated like a queen. Bacchanal was over-the-top delicious and I needed a nap after. The view from the room made it difficult to leave it. The pillows and couches were so comfy also. Cannot wait to return in December.
40,Rooms are beautiful. I stayed in the Augustus tower. The food court is great. It would be nice if there was a regular cafe. The one in the front is good but very pricey (also not owned by Caesars) staff in the Hotel is awesome
10,I had a bad experience overall. I tried checking in early and was unavailable to check in until 5pm.  The employees were very rude did not make me feel welcomed. My suite was not what I expected. Even check out was difficult.
40,Be very careful with your telephones in Vegas as my daughter had her phone hacked and the hotel stated there was nothing they could do to prevent that from happening. Checked with hotel management and hotel security and they both said nothing could be done. Have to report it to Vegas police. Took several hours out of our vacation to get it resolved but no help.
50,First time at Caesar's Palace and it was my best experience at a hotel casino. Everything was first rate. The room was spacious with a sectional and ottoman. Great view of the pool down below. Restaurants and shops were the best. Great service and value. Worth every penny. Highly recommended and I will return to Caesar's Place again.
50,Linq location is excellent. Rooms have been updated. Housekeeping staff was very friendly at all times. Sales people by the guest elevators are a little annoying. Room price is good for the location. Hash hash a go go restaurant onsite is good and staff in the restaurant is friendlu
50,Didn‚Äôt stay that long cuz we were staying with husband cousin house he has a beautiful house and a pool with slide And plus Jaccuzzi.and three bedrooms two bath and beautiful kitchen and living room plus another family room.
50,I've been a loyal Caesars guest for the past ten years and here's why. The hotel is conveniently located in the middle of The Strip breakfast at the Cafe Americano is a great way to start the day Caesars has the best shows and entertainers the rooms in the Augustus Tower are superb and Caesars employees provide exceptional service. It just doesn't get any better anywhere in Vegas.
30,"This will be my 3rd trip for a professional event in a year. Staff is always very attentive and courteous & the conference facilities are very well set up.    A few items to improve: The marble trim in my bathroom was falling off in multiple spots one I slipped on walking into the bathroom. Another is the ""aroma"" of sewage in the hallways below the Palace Tower and pool entrance into the shops that been consistent for every visit. Last is the billing for snack and bar items in the room that always show up in my bill despite not touching any even the overpriced coffee supplies preventing an electronic check-out and having to deal with the lines at the desk."
50,This place is clean friendly staff and I won a bunch of money there! The buffet is delicious too. I enjoyed the sports betting area to watch games and lots of tables games. There is a huge conference halls lots of shopping and restaurants.
50,We stayed 7 days at Caesar‚Äôs in the Octavius tower and it was a fabulous experience! The room was beautiful and service was great! The restaurants were incredible. My favorite was Beijing Noodle No. 9 for its authentic Chinese food and casual atmosphere. The virtual concierge was extremely helpful and successfully helped me several times with various requests. All hail the king of hotels in Vegas!
40,Good hotel for us to stay for my cousins wedding. It‚Äôs in the center of everything. Restaurants in the casino are good. Spa and fitness area are not too bad. Not too expensive to stay and still get to all the actions in Las Vegas
50,Great location on the strip. There are plenty of restaurant options The Caesars shopping area is Hugh. So many options. Very friendly staff. I would definitely plan to stay there in the future. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to family and friends.
30,Love the property but was disappointed with the lack of action from the quick text response of my request. Stayed three nights and requested housekeeping clean the room only once for the last day and the room did not get cleaned.
50,Had a great time.  Caesars Palace was clean and accommodating.  Plenty to do. Tables were friendly and pit bosses were jovial as well.  We stayed 5-6 days. Plan to go back next year 31st anniversary.  Check-in and out was fast.
50,Great hotel! Loved the Caesar casinos and buffets and the hotel locations. Customer service was great. Loved the check in/out online feature. Loved the selection of restaurants and stores. Had a great time and will definitely be back!
50,First time at Caesars Palace and it definitely won‚Äôt be the last. Everyone from the moment I checked in was friendly and professional. Always willing to help and answer any questions. Impeccable service and amazing experience.
50,Overall cleanliness excellent. Only downside was having only one craps table open in the mid-morning. Not a deal breaker but consideration should be made to staff table game. Sign in to Players Club was easy peasy.
50,We really enjoy Ceasar. It's a beautiful experience and excellent service. From the hotel to the Forum Shops. We love the decor as well. You will not be disappointed. We definitively planning on staying here again.
40,Water at the swimming pools was unbearably cold. Although the property was nice the inability to take advantage of the swimming pools put a damper on the trip. As a result I do not think we would visit this property again and would research which properties have pools that are kept at a swim-able temperature.
50,We had a great time at Caesars for my 50th birthday celebration! We saw Def Leppard and Keith Urban in concert ate at Hell's Kitchen and had a blast in the casino all night long. The rooms have been re-done and are a great place to relax or catch a few winks between activities!
50,For the most part very good. There were a few ups and downs which one experiences on any trip. Nothing to really complain about.  Suite was excellent and Room Service and Housekeeping were excellent.  Special shout out to Princess the server at the slots for amazing service.
50,Everything was great staff and casino. Everyone was so nice and friendly as they always are at the properties I have visited. I will definitely return and would recommend to everyone. I also ate at the buffet at caesars. Great food.
50,If you like Football or Sports in general the best Pool Keith Urban Excellent Steak House with Luxurious Accomadtions this is the place for you  Easy acces as it is centrally located. Great shows and shopping if you are into that This place has it all Just look at the property and you will see all of the small details on the architecture of the building. Love it feels like you are in a far away land
50,Was a 2 day trip they have the best spa in Vegas! Definitely stay here for the pool and spa. Also visited the new restaurant vanderpump was very pretty food was not memorable though. Nobu and mr chow would have been better
50,The place is just mesmerising. The place is huge and every detail is though through. Restaurants and shops in abundance...  Didn‚Äôt stay at the hotel but next time I definitely will.  A must see/visit....
50,I was here for a work conference followed by a little free time - stayed for 6 nights in total.    When I first arrived I was so overwhelmed by how big and busy it was! Once I found my way round I started to appreciate how awesome this hotel was!    Room - was great. Clean comfortable and great facilities. Yes the mini bar is ridiculously expensive but there are shops everywhere to buy drinks etc. I do think they should put free bottled water in the rooms though.    Conference facilities were excellent and good quality food.    So many nice restaurants and bars (see other reviews) excellent service all round    Pools are magnificent    Didn‚Äôt use the casino but it looked very popular! And large!    Great location in the best part of the strip.    Going to come back for a holiday for sure!
50,Caesers really has it all!    Great casino great rooms good service and a big diversity of restaurants. Hoping to come back asap ! If possible get the upgraded rooms (you should get an email a few days before your arrival)
40,This place is massive and always seems busy! I have stayed here twice. The rooms at the Octavius Tower were larger. Give yourself plenty of time to walk anywhere in the hotel. Many restaurants to explore. Buffet always busy as well. Morning coffee and food is generally quite expensive. Rooms are very clean and good. Caesar's decor is hilarious. Big convention area. The gym is next to the spa and is always very busy. It's a great gym; very big but there are virtually no signs to help you find the gym.  Being Caesar's it is common to hear noisy people in the hallway... at all times of the night.
50,Everything about Ceasars Palace from the staff to all the shopping dining and night life would definitely recommend going there with friends or family this was the best experience I've had in vegas yet thank you
50,I always stay at Caesars because I feel safe and the customer service is awesome. The room service is great and the spa is the best in my opinion when compared to others in Vegas. For the most part the total rewards systems is great and I highly recommend that you join the rewards system.
50,"This was a first trip to Vegas for the majority of our group but overall our stay at Caesars was a wonderful experience. People that harped to bring/wear comfortable shoes were not exaggerating. My FitBit confirmed more than 27 miles of walking from Sunday afternoon through Wednesday morning. Borrowing a phrase objects in your view are NOT as close as they appear. LOL    You'll note from my other reviews that I am generally not one to single or ""shout out"" by name any particular staff member(s) but Delano who checked us in at the front desk and quite coincidentally checked us out is the quintessential customer service representative and absolutely deserves to be acknowledged. He greeted our party with a smile worked diligently to bring our party together. (Our reservations were initially scattered in different ""towers"".) He worked with us so efficiently as to make the process on both ends painless and in doing so he has guaranteed that Caesars will get our (individual and group) business in the future.    The cleaning staff the restaurant and counter staff were likewise efficient and accommodating and always with an open welcoming smile.    Our room was in the Augustus Tower with a direct view of the Bellagio fountains next door. The tower itself is bright airy and appears newly renovated. Our room was spacious. The bathroom (double vanity large shower AND spa soaking tub) was more than ample. Yes it was an upgrade but money that everyone in our party agreed was well spent.    With the exception of the casino night club we never felt crowded or compressed and as we made it a point to visit at least a half dozen other casinos along the strip our unanimous vote was that Caesars' is the best casino and it most definitely (by far) had the most diverse buffet."
40,Caesar‚Äôs Palace is a beautiful hotel with gorgeous clean rooms and many with a view of the Bellagio fountains.. love staying at Caesar‚Äôs!  There are 7 pools plenty Resturants and plenty to do for non gamblers too.
50,We received a great price for a great room and I don't consider ourselves high rollers. The Augustus tower room we had viewed a wonderful show of belagios water fountains. The room had been recently remodeled which was also a plus. All the employees through out the whole casino were very accomadating and friendly. There is something for everyone there. Food was very good. Only complaint I have all of Las Vegas on the strip the food has become astronomical
30,My was excellent clean and pleasant. The wall window provided an awesome view of the property and and an awesome sun rise. Staff members were friendly and very helpful. There lines but they handle people with ease efficiency and professionalism.
50,"The hotel is very nice and well maintained. The rooms are very clean and quiet. The hotel and casino are easy to get around and the staff is very friendly. I wish I would have gotten the name of the elderly security officer because he would always say ""Good morning enjoy your stay I hope you are having great day"""
50,We love Caesars Palace Las Vegas. It offers something for everyone. The rooms are luxurious and comfortable. Great selection of gaming. Entertainment is always good. Shopping is plentiful. Qua Spa is a royal treat.
50,This was our 1st time staying at Caesars and Anthony greeted us with such friendliness and made us feel like we were family. He is so professional and kudos to hiring such an amazing employee! As we were leaving Tangela and I had a great conversation as well! She has a way of making you feel like she has known you forever!! I absolutely love these two and l hope that I see them next time!! Thanks again for being so friendly!!
50,Excellent room and service as always. Great food and accommodations. Definitely would come back and highly recommended to everyone. Have good times on table games. store salesladies are very friendly and helpful. Wife bought lots of shoes dresses and jackets.
30,Hotel is very nice. However the water in the swimming pools was very cold making it unusable to swim in comfortably. I suspect that is done intentionally to keep quests in the casino rather than pool side. The inability to enjoy the swimming pools put a definate damper on our trip as we never went back to the pools after the first day even though the weather was ideal for sitting at the pool.
50,"We've been to Vegas several times and I honestly don't think I'll ever stay anywhere but Caesars again. The property itself has everything. A lot of the nice shows are located on site. The Hell's Kitchen Restaurant is on site. Plus there are the Forum Shops which is a huge mall. The truth is you don't have to leave this property -- it has everything.    LOCATION: It's perfectly located in what feels like the center of the strip. A short walk to see the fountains at the Bellagio...or the outside restaurants at the Paris. The Miracle Mile shops are walkable too.    ROOM: We stayed in the Octavius tower and it was wonderful. The room was huge it was in outstanding shape and had beautiful amenities. The only downside is that it's far away from the front desk so there's a long walk with your luggage after you check in. But that's just the slightest of inconveniences. I heard that some of the other towers might be older and the rooms might be run down but I've never stayed them. Our room in the Octavius Tower had a great view of the pools as well.    POOLS: Wow. They are awesome. You absolutely need to set aside one day just to sit by these pools. You can get drinks out there and eat and the food is pretty good. Just make sure that you go down there early so you could get a seat‚Äî they fill up quickly. If you want to people watch you need to get down there at about 10 am and get a seat at the center rectangle pool (I don‚Äôt remember the name). That‚Äôs where most people hang out. But we sat around the circular pool and it was a great day.    PRICE: Listen Vegas is a resort and if you go during the high demand times it‚Äôs going to be expensive. Even when you go in the lower demand times there are still going to be resort fees (which basically give you nothing) but you get that at every hotel in town. For us personally it all worked out. We went in September after the kids went back to school so the room rate (including resort fees) was about $170 per night. You can‚Äôt beat that. The time of week also makes a difference. We think that Tuesday - Friday is the best time to go. You avoid the madhouse that Vegas becomes on the weekends and the weekday prices are usually a little more affordable. We flew in Tuesday night had all day Wed & Thurs and then flew out Friday. If you‚Äôve never been to Vegas you‚Äôll want more time for your first visit but a return visitor will be ok with that time.    CHECKOUT: Use the checkout option on your phone or the TV in the room. That way you avoid the lines. The TV option worked perfectly for us.    UBER TIP: The only problem I had is that there are so many different places on this property where the Uber/Lyft can pick you up that our driver ended up going to the wrong place a few times. Do yourself a favor and select ""Main Entrance"" and just wait for them at the big circle in the front entrance. It's easier than the shops or the Colosseum pick up."
50,Elpidio checked us in to hotel and was so helpful. Caesar's palace continues to be one of the best hotels in Vegas. The only thing I wish there was more options for food court. It was my families first trip to Vegas and they loved Augustus Tower.
50,I had a great time at ceasers.I will definitely be back. I'll tell all my friend about my stay and how well I was treated.  All though I had a great time I dont believe I was rated correctly at the craps table.
50,The room was clean comfortable easy to get to . Staff was happy to help in any way possible and friendly. I have and will continue to recommend this resort to others. The other couple we were with had some travel issues do to a hurricane and the flight was cancelled and without hesitation gave quick and helpful assistance and turned a bad situation into a memorable trip. Thank you
50,great room good pillows and comfortable bed and clean room not noisy at al great location with a great view ordered some food to my room and got delivered on time and the food nice and warm also the pool was pretty convenient and the health room as well
40,Caesars had a nice room for us (4052). Nice view of the fountain and large quarters.  Gambling in the high limit was so-so.  Slots could be a bit looser but it‚Äôs a gamble right!  Had a good time will likely return.  My host Logan Mason is a pleasure to work with.
40,The rooms are well kept beds comfortable but maybe needing some upgrade.  Food choices range from food court to celebrity restaurants to sophisticated high end.  Beware parking is $18 per day but being located in the middle of the strip it is convenient to all the casinos.
50,Caesars always takes care of us. From the cabana out at the pool to the sports book and the great dealers. The absolute best dealer at Caesar‚Äôs was UL at the black jack tables. What a night!!!
30,The updated Palace rooms were very nice. Loved the location of Caesar‚Äôs to great restaurants shopping shows and other hotels. The casino was fun and had all sorts of gaming options. We didn‚Äôt get to use their amazing spa.    What could be better:  - checkin was quick but should have provided more info on the various areas of the hotel rewards card beverage.  - amenities. Where are the robes slippers and complimentary water? Go green instead of the little bottles of shampoo conditioner body wash have built in large re-fillable bottles.  -people who work at the hotel - mixed some were very nice some - not very friendly.    Would expected better overall service from this hotel
50,Caesars palaceIs the place my family and I always stay at when visiting Las Vegas the staff the rooms the amenities they‚Äôre all top- notch there‚Äôs lots of things to do I I always enjoy Visiting there this past weekend we got to see Keith urban show the staff in the Colosseum as usual great because we‚Äôve seen a number of shows there and they‚Äôre all just great the food at the different restaurants the cleanliness of the rooms and the size of most of the rooms especially when I‚Äôm not going to save the tower name because I don‚Äôt want to be unable to book a room
40,Caesar‚Äôs in Las Vegas  Very nice experience the shows are great people very friendly and helpful and easy to find someone many Restrauart‚Äôs to choice from and food was good lots of machine and tables to play
50,I will bring my family friends come to caeser at Las Vegas for gambling and dine out and enjoy the tables game slot restaurant drinks I will let people know what is look like in Vegas all the table are full of people have fun win or lose we still have fun!
50,Caesars is the best hotel and gaming property on the Las Vegas strip. The food service and hotel accommodations are unparalleled. Representatives are courteous well informed and willing to provide the best gaming experience
40,I had an amazing time at Cesar palace! The buffet was incredible. They had a huge selection of food from crab legs to stake. Cesar also have a ginormous swimming pool which is perfect to cool off from the heat.
40,Very nice room. Great location on the strip. Easy walking distance to many attractions. Lots of dining choices and very good food. The pool area was very nice except for the drinks at the outdoor bar were pricier than expected. Staff was cordial knowledgeable and helpful. Initial check-in was extremely busy and there weren't enough windows open.
50,We had a blast at this property last August. It‚Äôs an amazing place to stay at. We were placed at the Octavius Tower in a premium room and it was sincerely amazing our room had a super bathtub and a nice view.    Pros: Diamond and 7 stars members have a separate office to check in which is awesome and make the process way smoother the property is clean 24/7 the pools were to die for (The Garden of God‚Äôs pool was always super cold though).    Cons: You won‚Äôt be willing to come back home ü§£.
50,My room was excellent. very clean floor was very quiet the maids were very friendly but thats what i like about HARRAHS everyone is very friendly and willing to help you. If yoiu need anything that is not there  get it immediately. I needed a refridgeater for my insuline they got it immediately
50,Caesars Palace is my favorite hotel/casino in Las Vegas. The rooms are large and clean. The casino is very roomy with a great selection of slots and tables. There are all types of restaurants and the buffet is the best in town.
50,Went to CP for dinner dining at the Cheesecake factory. Everything between the parking lot and there was great. Friendly service brilliant spectacle and a clean and comfortable location. Would highly recommend a visit.
50,"As always Caesars did a great job with our room and the service at all venues was great! The ""Social Hour"" at Mr Chow's is our favorite: great drinks and food superior staff!! If you are a veteran look into their Salute card!!"
50,Beautiful room great view. American Cafe was delicious-huuggee portions! Rao's Italian Restaurant-A must! Food court has tasty real milkshakes at Smashburger. Bartenders were great Kim makes a mean Bloody Mary.
50,I visited this property for the first time with friends. We had so much fun. The rooms were clean and really nice. The property is huge and easy to get lost. there is just about every type of cuisine you can crave. We tried Vanderpumps restaurant and it was dumb delicious. We layed at the pool and drank and swam felt like i was out of the country. Im a fan!!!!
50,this is my go to hotel has every thing you need great service great food and lots of great people I feel safe and care free I am able to play and eat good and relax in the so very nice rooms great drinks they have a upscale food court and a great cigar bar
20,Express check in did not work for me and nothing would let me know it. It is only when I went to the front desk few hours later that I was told there was nothing about my check-in in the system. Always about the check-in you have to pay $40 to get your room before 4 PM although it is ready. If you don't pay this $40 you have to leave your luggages to the bell service who will not let you take them back : they force room delivery (and tip). Generally speaking Ceasar's people are arrogant and do not care about your problems worries and frustrations. On my last evening when I came out of the taxi back from the convention center with a heavy luggage I was not allowed to use a luggage trowlley. This place is overrated and anywhere else can't be a worst value overall.
50,I ck in today... staff at front ck in was very accommodating and professional as well as highly efficient. The gym is well equipped and the elevators are fast unlike some hotels. The room spacious and well decorated. Very happy customer
50,You gotta love this place beautiful gigantic piece of art with awesome customer service i loved the studio suite very neatly organized.  I can't stay away from the buffet and i just would like to try the Omnia club on my next visit in few days
50,The hotel is outstanding. You do not have to leave the property to purchase anything.Food was great. Slot machines were tight but fun. The employees were kind and helpful. Overall it was a great trip.
40,Good food nice room and very spacious.  Gaming was good and very friendly staff.  The shops and restaurants were nuce and scenery was fantastic. The entire property is very well organized and easy to find evertything.
50,Good location - right in the middle of the strip. The overall good customer services from the food court to the restaurants and the casino floor employees. The easy in and out valet parking to the forum shopping and the hotel front door. The beautiful forum shopping center.
50,Had really no interactions with anyone except the rewards counter which service was excellent  Great casino loved the improvements  Love the casino  The venue that I saw Keith Urban was fantastic I only came for an overnight
50,We stayed Tuesday - Sunday at Ceasars Palace in the Forum Classic Suite. One King Room and a Queen Double with a connector. Room was very spacious. Was a little shocked the make you pay for coffee and there was no refrigerator for a suite. The closet in the king was amazing. Was also dissappointed they didnt give any kind of free play. For the most part it was a amazing trip and enjoyed Ceasars and would return again.
40,Great location great amenities wonderful restaurants friendly service and overall great deals for what you get. We go back almost every three months for great concerts. Unbelievable performances. This time Keith Urban. absolutely amazing!!
40,One of the best casinos in vegas but definitely the priciest. On weekends some minimum payments are 25 dollars. This is a bit high to me when I could go to Harrah's down the street for 5 dollar minimums.
50,I recently came here with a friend to see the Keith Urban concert. It was a great experience. We had the very last row of the Colosseum but it was still a great venue. Afterwards we played slots and I actually walked away with a little money. All in all it was a great experience!
50,"Caesar's never fails to come through for us -- beautiful clean well-serviced rooms great food in great restaurants and a level of play in the casino that is more than satisfactory. We five siblings try to come every year on a ""getaway"" and are always welcomed and completely satisfied."
50,Great stay. a HUGE complex.... Reminds me of Disneyland for ADULTS!  It easy to get lost trying to find your room- pay attention the first time around aha.  I don't gamble but found this hotel is located conveniently to all sort of activities.  If you can get an upgrade the rooms are swanky with nice marble well appointment bathrooms.  Check-in is via a kiosk which did not work well so a lovely lady named Soo helped me.  There is a resort fee to be aware of that increases the room price substantially. If you are traveling for business and cannot enjoy the perks it is an unnecessary hit to the wallet.  There is a HUGE enclosed mall attached- The Forum Shops. You could easily spend 2 days there and not miss the sun! Although your wallet may be a lot lighter.  Nice restaurants and great shopping choices plenty of mid cost to high end for both.  - I loved Joe's Seafood way at the far end of the mall.  Caesar's has a pleasant valet and bell staff and at least 2 Starbucks inside when you need to caffeinate up!  I wish I could have stayed longer to hang out and enjoy the pool scene as well. Watch the Bellagio water show when you walk around outside always a pleasure!
40,We didn‚Äôt have a room at Caesars we went to a concert and the venue was very good we had great seats they got us in and out of the concert expeditiously the gaming floor was awesome they had a lot of different areas to gamble and the cocktail waitresses were were there but it took a while to get the drink
50,Went for a weekend to see Keith Urban. My family and I had a blast. Everything was better than expected. Rooms were gigantic with great views. Pool was a blast and had plenty of room for everyone. Great restaurants everywhere.
50,Staff was great property was amazing we had a wonderful time definitely would recommend Caesars Palace. Also the food at noble was amazing the adult pool we had a great time in the blackjack tables in the pool were awesome
50,Caesars is a must go to when you are in Las Vegas. The restaurantsand sports bars are great. They have a cigar and a great mix of shops to fit everyone's desires. The casino is a showplace in itself. TH e whole place is clean and all of the staff are very friendly
50,I haven't stayed ate the hotel but go to the casino. First - the food. The buffet is by far the best I have ever had bar none. I have found that the casino payouts on the slots are good - I usually stick to a machine and have had a lot of luck. And if you can go to a show - go to there Colisseum! I saw Keith Urban and not only was his show terrific but the venue is perfect for viewing. One complaint? Smoke. I know all of the casinos more or less let you smoke anywhere which I don't like (would rather see a designated area) but for some reason the smoke at Caesar's seems worse than other casinos. But it's the best!
40,Good resort but the table games are getting to be too expensive. The rooms are nice and the staff is friendly. The food court has a good selection but the prices are getting to be to high. Good selection of slot machines but payouts are low.
30,The check-in process is horrible. Because my legal name didn't match the name on my credit card (so I was told) my room wasn't available for nearly 6 hours after I checked in. No one seemed to care as I was simply another number in the hundreds that check-in on a daily basis. Be wary of this and if you can I would recommend just about any place else as everything here is just about the same with a twist on themes.
10,Not sure what has happened to Caesars but we booked a Forum Tower Suite with adjoining room. We were not able to get into our adjoining room until 8:30 pm. I think normal hotels guarantee entry into your room by 4 pm. When I showed up at 5:30 pm and complained I was told they only guarantee rooms by 6 pm. I tried my room key that they provided. It didn‚Äôt work. I was told to use the phone in the hallway to call down they told me it was an issue with the battery in the room key reader on the door. We waiting for over 2 more hours with nothing. I finally had to go back down at 8 pm and ask why I still didn‚Äôt have access. I asked that since I did not have access and it was 8 pm now that I get a refund on my room for the night. I was offered a discount only. I asked at that point whether it was true or not that they guaranteed rooms by 6 pm. At that point they brought the big manager out and she proceeded to lie to me telling me that the engineer had gone up to the room twice already and had fixed the problem. This was quite impossible considering I had been up there and checking on the room every 10 minutes for over 2 hours. To enhance the lie she told me that the engineer had spoken to me or someone pretending to be me and that the room was already open. I asked that if she didn‚Äôt believe that my key didn‚Äôt work that she go with me upstairs and or send someone with me up so I could show them that my key didn‚Äôt work. Her response was that she wasn‚Äôt allowed to work the desk. At this point I realized that her story that she told me was to buy them time to send an engineer up while I was at the desk. So at that point I called my buddies who were in the adjoining suite and sure enough during my call my buddy tells me that an engineer had just showed up. I could hear the engineer complaining about the front desk and how they didn‚Äôt understand how to issue keys despite him telling them what to do and what not to do constantly. It ended up being a quick fix. I marched back to the desk and told her that the engineer despite her story had just come up at 8:30 pm for the first time and fixed the problem. She smiled and said she would give me a discount. In addition the adjoining suite had a terrible TV that was very dim. We called twice and the first engineer said he couldn‚Äôt do anything about it while 2 hours later a second engineer came and said the TV had no brightness setting that he could fix (seriously  what TV doesn‚Äôt have that?)
10,Unfortunately although I did initially enjoy my stay here which was saved up for and looked forward to for a long time for my 30th birthday I am forced to give this low rating as I have returned home without my most treasured possession.  I brought my childhood toy sheep with me on the trip and left it it in plain view on the pillow before going out for the day. When I came back it was gone. Clearly no-one else had access to the room except household staff.  I instantly reported this to reception staff but while sympathetic they explained that all laundry is sent to a 'third party' and would not let me speak to this external company to describe the toy to them.  While I fully appreciate that this was an accident I do not see it as acceptable that they can apparently do nothing else except report the missing item to the third party laundry company. Ultimately something of mine is gone due to the actions of their staff yet I have received no apology or offer of compensation.  Unsurprisingly I have heard nothing back despite filling out several missing item reports. I will never know how this missing item was reported to the laundry company but suspect my emotional distress could not have been conveyed as I could have done if I had been permitted to speak to them myself. They probably would prioritise an expensive gadget but this item was irreplaceable and meant the world to me.  Ultimately I will have to live with the regret of taking it with me on this trip all my life however I have stayed in hostels across the world - including backpacking across Australia - and had no problems at all.  Maybe Caesers Palace is putting too much pressure on household staff to clean rooms quickly which is how a clearly visible item could apparently be swept into the laundry. Or maybe they just don't care.
20,Bad: Venus/Cove Beach Pool-no service on either day music too loud chairs side by side with no privacy from other couples no table for drinks drink prices too high ($10 for Diet Pepsi). Still waiting for credit from April trip because pool wasn't open. Housekeeping act as if they don't speak English. Rooms need renovated. No food or free play comps-even being 2 Diamond Members. Other casinos offering better stays. Low standards for a Caesar's property.
50,Check in was quick and got a room upgrade overlooking the pool. Room was big and close to the elevator. Hotel is located at the middle of the strip giving walking access to most of the other hotels and shops. Had a great time. Great place to stay tour and relax in the pools.
40,Huge hotel complex - 5+ sleeping room towers 10+ restaurants 5+ entertainment options and something called a casino. Midway on the Strip so pretty easy walk to anything on the Strip. Good service throughout. Nobu sushi is excellent. Room rates can be very cheap but food is not. Cheap eats across the street.
50,Highly recommend staying at hotel! Clean great service and conveniently located near everything. Restaurants are good and priced well. Rooms are spacious and hotel staff keeps things clean. Pool and workout area are great! Spa is fantastic
50,I have stayed at Caesar‚Äôs Las Vegas many times and every time is great but this trip was extra special. The suites in a palace Tower were amazing! Hands down the nicest rooms and always classy staff. Their housekeeping is 2nd to none! A shout out to the staff in the spa as well.... you guys always make my experience wonderful. Sports book excitement was at a all time high with their state of the art TVs! This trip was the best one yet. Can‚Äôt imaginr how they can top this trip
20,We recently stayed at Caesars Palace in Vegas! We upgraded to a large suite with two master bedrooms and baths. What we were paying for the room I thought it would be really nice.........man was I wrong! The room looked like you stepped back into the 1970's and the furniture was horrible! There were cigarette burns on the couch very worn the colors were horrible and the carpet was disgusting!!! I went back down to change the room. They no longer had any rooms. They did take my upgrade charge off but it was not worth what we were paying a night! I will not be going back!
30,Appreciated early check in but was charged $34.00 without being informed. Room is okay good bathroom but closet was very funky with doors sticking into my room and off-center to access hanging garmets hallway door to room was loose on top hinge so it had to be slammed to close (asked attendant to fix and they did not) sink drain cap left on counter What saves this place is the Gordon Ramsay and Bobby Flay dining options. Sports Book seems small and packed.
20,Unable to check in at kiosk first two times and was never notified that room was ready. Was charged $37. for cashewsm&m's and water set out on table that we believed were complimentary. Food was very expensive $29. each for a sausage and egg with coffee breakfast. Unable to get out of the parking lot without calling an attendant because room key did not work. You can find a wonderful room at the Silverton for a lot less $ and better customer service. Very disappointed in the Caesars Place experience.
50,Great atmosphere cocktail service on point great location good selection on slots machines  Shopping is amazing~ great selection on all the stores ~ definately recommend a place to visit  Good selection on shows and concerts too.
50,Caesars was great as usual. Everything was perfect the buffet Omnia was insane everyone was friendly. Also checked out Vanderpump which was a cool little place. Only complaint is the changes at Venus.
20,It is incredible that a hotel that handles multiple international clientele cannot accept a credit card authorization coming from overseas. Bad excuse bad judgement and totally inadequate for a hotel that it is being sold internationally.  Sorry is not a solution for a client that has given all the necessary documentation in the form of a credit card authorization signed by the credit card holder. Lack of resources to satisfy a normal client. Totally unacceptable
40,Overall great place to stay at. There‚Äôs an ample amount of restaurants/eateries and a large shopping center. Slot machines galore. Heads up not too many $15 and less tables. Dealers are super friendly and which is always a plus!
10,Poorly treated and was charged a 350 dollar depositNo free anythingMy friends got better deals and they do not gamble at allI play big all the time.Kc Caesars is wayyy better and the staff just entered my room without permission talking about room checkLucky I was there..
40,Rooms are nicely appointed. We had an upgraded room that was a reasonable size and had a large bathroom. The casino is well ventilated so not as smokey as most. Check in can be a bear but the express checkin features are a plus. Pools looked amazing. Beds were comfortable but sheets are in the scratchy side. You get a text from a concierge that is provided as a contact if you need anything.    You would think the rooms would be quiet but we were woken by the gentleman in the next room 2 mornings. I guess he had the stomach flu. I‚Äôm surprised how much we could hear.    If you plan a trip decide what you will be doing before choosing a room. The place is huge and not always well marked. There are various towers. Parking is only on one side of the casino totally opposite from check in. It is quite a walk. Plan accordingly if not using valet parking.    It is pricey. I can do with the room charge but there can be lots of add ons. There is a $39 per night resort fee. I‚Äôm not sure what it covers as we were not provided information about hotel amenities at check in. Was there a fitness room? Use the mini fridge for personal use-$75. They provide a coffee pot in your room but you pay for the provided pods. They don‚Äôt tell you about free WiFi unless you ask. 2 devices per day. More than that added on.    They want to encourage you to be ‚Äúgreen‚Äù and waive housekeeping services. When I pay over $200 for a room a $10 food credit to an overpriced restaurant doesn‚Äôt make sense. I would rather contribute part of the room cost to someone‚Äôs employment.    Housekeeping did stop by each day at a reasonable time to make beds empty trash and change towels.    We used self check out but then it tells you to go to the front desk for a receipt. We never received an email receipt.    Overall a nice hotel. I do feel they charge for too many add ons. By visiting some of the other casinos it does appear to be one of the nicer ones.
50,We love to stay in the strip for the excitement in the air but staying at Caesar‚Äôs Palace takes the Vegas experience to another level. The staff are always willing to go above and beyond our expectations.
30,I guess I thought this would be a adventure like no other but very disappointed with check in time and mini bar and the cost of everything. Its a tourist town for sure and if its gambling you want I know of other places that's much better bang for your buck. but it Vegas so there you go...
50,Keep a long story short we originally booked with TI thinking it was family friendly like in the good old days. To my disappointment the place is frat house and a DUMP. The service and cleanlyness was just the worst. The food was terrible and overpriced. So me and my 4 rooms that I booked went over to Caesars Palace. What a change. They really do set the bar and dealing with them right off the bad is so refreshing. We had a billing issue and Anthony at the front desk was very patient and walked us thru the process along with his manager Sarah. They really bent over backwards. The restaurants are very nice but VERY EXPENSIVE! But all in all we have had a very pleasant experience.
50,Ceasars is a very nice place to stay. Decor is beautiful! There was various restaurants plus a food court to choose from. Right in the heart of the strip so it was easy to get around.  Our hotel clerk Julia P was extremely friendly nice and helpful. She greeted us with a big smile!
30,It was a mixed bag. The casino is beautiful. The rooms were great and there is tons of dining. Check in was awesome as well.What I didn't enjoy was our room was never cleaned on a 3 day stay. Even though we called each night when we got back to the room to advise it was not done. Also the loyalty program is not that great in terms of getting additional charges comped. Overall it is beautiful place but really expensive. I only stayed there because of a concert I wanted to see. next time I will most likely stay at another casino and just come there for the concert.
10,Street person allowed to enter hotel elevator unchecked and pick pocket registered guest. Hotel needs to post a security individual at the elevator entrances to keep unauthorized person's from gaining access to room elevators.
50,"We had a most excellent check in experience. My friend and I had separate room reservations. And while I'm a ""Diamond"" rewards member my friend is not. But Jay was able to find us adjoining rooms and get us both checked in very quickly. Employees like Jay are one of the reasons I stay with Caesars."
50,First time to Vegas! Loved it and can‚Äôt wait to come back. My wife and I came for our seventh year anniversary. Love Caesars Palace in the experience. Everyone was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay
50,We stayed here for 4 nights at the end of our 17 day road trip along the west coast. We had our 3 boys with us aged 17 12 & 9. I can honestly say we didn‚Äôt know what to expect at first but we were blown away with our stay at Caesar‚Äôs. From it‚Äôs location on the strip facilities room sizes and overall customer service we cannot fault it. Check in was so smooth we had 2 rooms in the Augustus tower which overlooked the strip and both our rooms had the wonderful view of the Bellagio fountain. Rooms are very spacious.  We paid for the valet service as it saves so much time.  The casino bars and restaurants are all great as are the shops at Forum.  We saw the pool area one evening which is a beautiful area but unfortunately didn‚Äôt have time during our stay to use it.    We highly recommend this resort when staying in Vegas!
50,This casino is still the leader after all these years. Enter this place and the difference is obvious. There are none more classy and stately than Caesar's.
50,Top notch casino and restaurants but skip the tent show ‚ÄúAbsinthe ‚Äú! A waste of money! The jokes were boring and senseless! The sport lounge is first class! Wide screens throughout and big comfortable chairs. A great place to bet and enjoy your favorite sport. There‚Äôs plenty of tables to bet your favorite game.
10,The prices on everything at Ceasar eesorts is outragouou. The Eldorado group ought to be ashamed of what has happened at these resorts. $20 hamburger/drink is just Highway robber when it's the size of a MacDonald's dollar menu item.
50,Just awesome rooms views lots of slots to play great restaurants fun pool atmospheres great Bars just a one stop shop to get your Vegas fix also outstanding sports book also hotel staff is just awesome.
50,I recently stayed for the first time in the Octavius Tower at Caesars and it was awesome. Although a little further to walk it was like an upgrade from the Augustus Tower that I usually stay in. It just felt newer also got an adjoining room with a friend which was also awesome.
40,"Our stay at the Paris in Las Vegas was met with a clean and comfortable room. The bed while not plush was comfortable. The room came with 50"" class HD TV. This hotel was operated by a very professional and very attentive staff. They met all of our requests and needs in a very timely manner."
40,Location is always nice resort fees suck think you're getting a complimentary room but you're not. Also the rooms have refrigerators but no microwaves please add these to the room how can I heat up my cold food from the fridge
50,Great ornate roman style casino hotel with variety of restaurants great performers and a fun place to visit. They have the Forum shopping area attached to the casino. You must try the Palm Restaurant inside the Forum!
50,Good service and location i felt like ceaser is one of the best hotels i have been to in las vegas and i would definitely come back only complaint i stayed at the palace tower and right next to your bath soap store there was a smell of sewage in the area but other then that everything was perfect.
50,My wife had a very good experience dealing with the players club over a match status to another casino. I played craps and crew was very nice and helpful as well. My wife played poker was good but tables were a little crowed together.
20,The rooms were not cleaned daily and when they were it was the bare minimum. We asked for our room to be cleaned on one of the days and when we returned we found a few small items missing from our belongings. We reported it and they couldn‚Äôt care less. Use the safes and don‚Äôt leave anything of value out or better yet stay elsewhere where they care when your belongings are stolen from your room.  It also smelled like the sewers on the hallway leading to palace tower our entire stay!
50,walked into the casino played a few hands of blackjack and dealer was friendly and welcoming. nearby bathrooms were cleaned and spotless. parking was easy to get into and out of. no issues with loyalty card upon parking exit.
40,Great Restaurants A1 Customer service Fun and Beautifully Class Ambiance.  Needs a little work with their Tier Point System and E-mail Responses. I have nothing more to say...  This has been the first time that I haven't received any e-mail Explanations on valid complaint about my tier credits totals be super SHORT... Sill a Great Resort !
20,"We chose Caesars Palace to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary upgraded our room and on 3 occasions we had amenity issues. What really disturbed us is during our check out at the reservation desk the gentleman said after we told him of the issues we experienced was ""AW that's too bad!'"
50,They always meet and exceed our expectations. There is truly no better hotel & casino on the Strip. The service is also the best. This place is very popular with many people for good reasons. Make sure to try the restaurants here.
10,Forum tower in Caesars Palace.    Rooms smell bad. Did not vacuum the floors in a while. Dirt on bath room tiles.    Did not get the right room and the staff did not accommodate it help to change the room next day either.
50,Without going into deep detail I have to say the staff in all areas of Caesar's Palace and Cromwell were way friendlier and helpful than MGM properties. Unfortunately I stayed at Vdara an MLife property and had a horrible experience. Lesson learned. After speaking with two different hosts I soon realized the difference in attitude and understanding they have for average players. I am not a huge slot player but I do play tables pretty often and spend a ton in the shops and on rooms pool area etc. Informed how CET properties view this differently than MGM and knowing this now my upcoming visits will be religiously booked at CET.
30,Rooms were clean and very modern. Be prepared to pay $40.00 extra if you arrive before 4:00 or to stand in long Bell man line to check luggage in. If your hungry don‚Äôt hang around to eat daily brunch unless your ok paying $90.00 for 2 people. Get complementary water from waitress on floor as it cost you 4.00 in your room!
50,Always one of the best hotels on the strip. Service is impeccable. Upgrades are scarce but hotel makes trip smooth.  Pool is Vegas style club. Dragon fruit mojito pitcher is a must.  Food options are great in surrounding area.
50,rooms were clean amenities were excellent. front staff very cordial. all staff answered all my questions and concerns. also restaurants within the hotel served delicious food and their wait staff were customer oriented.
50,The check-in and out process was painless. I find their food court and restaurant selections as catering to the most elegant to the most affordable and casual dining. Their rewards system is also great!
50,This is a great place to visit. I strongly recommend it to everyone. The food-court offers a variety of options for people with different tastes. Inside casino entertainment is very appealing and eye-catching. We loved it.
50,Had dinner at Old Homestead Steakhouse and in was Excellent.. Had fun playing a lot of new machines there.. Didn‚Äôt stay there but at Harrahs‚Äôs Hotel.. They have Updated All there rooms.. There Spa is an Excellent place too Visit..
50,architecture design of interior was spectacular  exterior was expansive  grounds well maintained  would like to return and see a show  missed my chance this trip  my next trip Caesars Palace will be my first stop
50,I took my dad for a few nights and our room was very nice in August us tower they even locked the mini fridge so I wouldn't get charged if my dad forgot haha! We enjoyed pool each day ate at several restaurants onsite and really enjoyed the diamond lounge! I read alot of negative comments before going and not a single bad thing happened to us everything and everyone was great!!
50,Love the rooms with the Bellagio Fountain view at Augustus Tower The Bacchanal Buffet The Omnia Bar The swimming pools The Qua baths spa to name a few. Impeccable service from staff. The best hotel on the strip!
50,Caesar's is one of my favorite properties to visit. It has nice rooms good restaurants and top headliners for entertainment. The gaming floor is massive and has all of the new games to play. I would reccomend this property to anyone who wants to have a good time.
30,"The Room was great nice size clean. Service was great pool attendants and servers in the restaurants. The show was great very funny and enterataining. Restaurant was great. Pool area not so much collection of gargage under the $125 a day ""daybeds"". They do move and you can pass a broom...."
40,Good clean rooms but way too long of a line at check In..Even so room was not even ready. Table games are not centralized tables a spread around the hotel..long walks from one end to the other.    Everything else was good good room service etc...
50,Room hotel service/staff and amenities were excellent.  Highly rated buffet left a lot to be desired in food quality and service. Server never came back to our table after being seated. Tables are too close together and we couldn't get away from one person dispersing food in the air next to us. We left without finishing our meal and informed the supervisor on our way out.
50,Excellent hotel rooms and service. The resort is located at the center of the Las Vegas Strip with excellent view from our room over the Bilagio's Fountain show. The Resort has everything you need from food to entertainment to the Spa and shops as well as the best Buffet we have been to in years. I strongly recommend staying here!
50,I had an awesome stay. I never realized it was so big. Nice clean and full of smiley faces .I rented a go cart and it helped tremendously. It would have nice to stay a lot longer. there was so much to see and do.
50,Great stay as usual. Been at Caesar Las Vegas many times. Always great. Service was great. Room was ready when I arrived. Room was clean. My contact with front desk staff They were very knowledgeable And professional.
50,Suite was great clean and cool. Beverage service at the slots was much better. Day beds at the pools were great and the service at the pools top notch. Maid service was timely and well done. All in all a great experience.
50,This resort has the best location on the strip. Luxorious rooms  great restaurants and a fantastic pool. Caesars employees are the best. The attached Forum Mall is ike I have never seen. If you have a c
50,Caesar‚Äôs Palace is amazing! The room was excellent. My wife was disappointed that the jets did not work in the large tub. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Everything was very clean and neat. Other than the faulty tub jets our stay was very enjoyable. I would definitely consider staying at Caesars again!
50,Three couples looking for relaxation fun terrific meals and gambling. We had a most wonderful experience! Everything was excellent. The restaurants in Caesar‚Äôs were tremendous especially their famous buffet. The pool was relaxing and refreshing. The service was impeccable. The casino dealers were great and helpful.
40,Another great trip to Ceasars in Las Vegas. Upgraded room when we arrived with no problems. Staff at the cabana (pool side) were great!! Did not win at the slots or blackjack.........this time. Looking forward to returning again!!!
50,the location was great the room was great had a view for the first time. We had great service our fridge was broken they came replace it love coming to Las Vegas. I come once a year. would love in they put me Caesars Palace but Baileys is good too.
50,Didn't stay there stop in to take in the beauty of it and play your slots. Nice clean friendly. Also I made a visit to Ceaser in Canada a coupler years ago...there no more to tell you I was in the Palace for no more than an hpur.
50,We love The Caesars Palace Every time we step foot into The Casino and Hotel it's always a nice experience and there's so many things to do besides gamble. From the moment you step foot off the elevator and touch the elegant Floor you feel The Energy and Excitement coming from Everyone.
50,"We had 20 college fraternity brothers (in our 50s) meet for a long weekend based out of Caesars. Yes it is huge and yes it can be smokey and yes it can be loud and yes it can be hot. Our group found different things to do other than occupy the gaming floor. Some played golf some hiked at Red Rock Canyon. Others used the pools and fitness center. Have some patience and treat the staff with courtesy and respect and it's amazing how much fun you can have without gambling constantly. My host upgraded me ahead of showing up the auto check in at the kiosks is wonderful. Ask for directions. The staff is more than happy to help. My ""phone hostess"" constantly checked in with me asking to help. She sent firm pillows ice advice help with check out..in general what ever you need the hostess can help all with a text. Housekeeping was prompt polite and thorough.  I was in the Palace Tower. Garden of the Gods pool was perfect. Friendly low key vibe. Great poolside beverage service. Water ice cold & the BEST cure for any aches and pains from the night before. (Wish the water in my room would have run that cold:). Easy to catch Uber/Lyft from the front circle fountain area.  Thanks to the Caesars staff for a great stay!    Kudos to Adam Miller and his staff. We had a great time!"
50,Always top notch service and choice of restaurants. Nobu and Old Homestead continue to be favorite stops for us. Good choices of table games and the latest spot machines. My choice of hotel/casino when visiting Las Vegas.
50,Exceptional services and a place to enjoy the experiences of Vegas. The food was excellent and always a treat. The shops had so many wonderful selections loved watch shopping in the forum. It is truly fantastic.
50,it was amazing food was 5 star stayed in 5088 awesome and the staff was great I will be back to stay and recommend this hotel. I watched a band that was incredibly at the barge. I will plan a trip next year the pools are great with 110 temp the pool was invigerating
50,Room upgrade midweek was awesome. Would highly recommend doing so. Enjoyed our stay. Location on the strip is great. No complaints. Stayed here multiples times and nothing bad to say. Love staying here
50,Room 642 at The Cromwell .  1. Over-sized bed frame causes customers to bump feet and shins every time. It hurts.  2. Door to bathroom did not close all the way leaving no privacy.  3. Room temp set to 66 when we walked in.  4. Phone had multiple messages on it and just flashed the whole time we stayed there.  5. Mini fridge unusable due to overpriced product being in there and a massive charge if used for anything else. I find this to be unbelievably sleazy - please change and allow customers to use the fridge (and microwave if possible). It would set you guys apart and people would be happy.
50,We had a great time and Michelle who checked us in got us upgraded to a jr suite with a pool view free of charge and it was awesome...everyone one of the casino dealers were always polite and helped explain each table game
50,I still think that Caesars Palace is the absolute best place to stay and be in Las Vegas. There is a reason that it is the lone survivor of the old guard casinos and there is a reason that it is still the standard that all of the new places try to replicate in terms of amenities quality and experience. I've stayed a few other places just to try them but always find myself wishing that I was back at Caesars by the end of my stay. I think I'll just keep it Caesars Palace from now on.
50,We had an excellent stay here at the hotel. Staff was amazing and very attentive. From the moment we were checking in to the moment we checked out. The room was super clean and the bed was very comfortable. We will definitely stay here again!
40,Caesars is a unique experience. The hotel is HUGE with lots of restaurants shops & entertainment. Rooms are clean and large.    Like most Vegas hotels plan to pay for EVERYTHING...even the WiFi was not included in the ‚Äúresort fee‚Äù that is added on to your total cost for your room.    Staff members are consistently friendly & helpful. Express check-in has a lot of glitches so be prepared to wait a bit for check-in.
20,Expensive and vast. You can walk in circles for hours - there is nowhere to sit unless it involves spending money - at bar restaurant or to gamble. It is an amazing place and you lose all perception of time of day. Shops are top end. There is a huge resort charge daily plus if you use the fridge for food bought outside the hotel you get charged more.  If you want to stay in a single hotel and lose all track of time feeling like someone who is privileged and spending money like water then this is the place for you - it is designed to make you feel good but to pay highly for that
50,Rae at the Diamond check in desk was excellent and wished us a happy anniversary. Super sweet! Stayed in the Augustus Tower. Love the luxury and quietness. Also same tower as Qua Spa so super easy to grab spa time.
50,When you come here ask for Delano he was exceptional at his customer service skills. He got us checked in very quickly and answered every question that me and my girlfriend had. Will definitely book this hotel everytime we come to Vegas.
50,We stayed at the palace tower and it was great very clean and well maintained. The restroom was very clean and the halls very neat. My experience staying at the palace tower was exceptional. Customer service was superb.
20,Ceasars was once a more key hotel on the strip. Well the Augustus tower in the palace tower have all been redone and I slammed the rest of the hotel needs to be cleaned up. Need to put the table games back near coliseum and not have all 50 and 25 tables. Encore Wynn Venetian and Palazzo all offer better deals. I will most likely focus my play there for the future. I‚Äôm a long Time ceasars rewards player just not the same.
50, for sure you can win 100dlls. Plus free drinks when you Are playing all Cesar palace casino. the cocktail ladies are very friendly.  Swimming pool and amazing Spa.  This is the best casino in LAS VEGAS. Enjoy Cesar palace casino with friends. cuples and family.  100 % I recommend.  Thank you to everyone of the team and staff of Cesar palace Casino.
50,My girlfriend and I were helped by Anselmo at the check-in desk. He is in the right line of work. Incredibly hospitable and kind. Our reservation was fouled up and he corrected and  then some. Will call Caesar‚Äôs home every time while in Vegas. A+++
50,Staff is always professional and responsive. Our room was clean and organized. We always enjoy the Augustus Tower because of its location to the strip and the casino. Housekeeping was good and detailed.
10,Right wer do I begin ther was so much wrong.Been to Vegas this past feb so I know the checkin lines are long so no problem with that. When u get to the end of the massive q you would kind of expect the reception staff to be pleasantwarm and inviting ohhh no we got a guy who couldn‚Äôt wait to off load us he was so rude because he was talking so fast to tell us wer r room was but this hotel is massive and I had to ask him 3 times to slow done and could he explain which direction we should go. We walked around for 20 mins and after stopping 3 security men we finally found our way. I believe the guy then after we left put a stop to house keeping on are room. Apparently they offer you 10 dollars üíµ token to be used in the hotel if u don‚Äôt use any hose keeping this was NEVER mentioned to us and I believe he done it because I kept having to asked him to slow done wen talking and he became so defensive with me. So for 3 days and paying $300 dollars a nite we hadn‚Äôt got a fresh towel brought to the room. We just kept thinking they wer forgetting about us. Then on the 3rd evening we returned to the room and still no fresh anything. Then I go to the front desk and was greeted by another guy who kept saying the system says u said no house keeping I kept saying no we didn‚Äôt he wouldn‚Äôt apologise he just kept repeating the same thing over and over I walked away disgusted. It‚Äôs simpleit‚Äôs a cattle market and if ur not prime beef they don‚Äôt give a hoot just roll on the next one.
40,Form Standard King room wasn‚Äôt anything special. Spend the extra few dollars and get the upgraded room. Pool was great. Could always get a beach chair and could find sun or shade at any time of the day. Get a Caesars Rewards card it‚Äôs free and worth it! Location on the strip was great! Right in the middle and nothing was too far to walk to.
50,This is a great hotel  the best location  the best entertainment  the best food the easiest and best check in and out process the best employees. Rooms were spacious  very clean and quiet. We stayed in the PALACE TOWER. Close to the pools which we did not visit due to the extreme heat outside . My first choice always even though a bit pricier. No car or taxi needed due to location  great walking .
50,The Diamond Lounge is a great place to hang out. Amazing bar tenders especially Rick. It is the number one reason I stay and play at Caesars. If you are Diamond go check out the lounge. The atmosphere is fun and Rick is friendly and funny. It is a can't miss experience. I will be back soon.
30,The property is amazing. The location is perfect. The food and shopping options are excellent.  My room was very nice but showed aging. Furniture all sctached up cheap shower fixture.  I still think its one of the best choices on the strip if its in your budget.
50,Caesars Palace is a fun place to walk through to stop and play some of the popular casino slots before heading to the Forum shops to browse and shop and then to find a restaurant to eat at We chose Hell's Kitchen to eat at. Didn't have reservations but was able to sit at the bar. This was a last minute decision. Definitely need to make reservations days in advance. The Beef Wellington was delicious and it was everything I expected it to be and the bartender who served us was awesome.
10,I arrived at 8:30 pm on Tuesday and was told that my room was not ready.waited for 59 mins and then room was ready on Thursday i was in meetings from 8:00 am to 10:00 pm no maid service room never serviced .departed on Saturday flight was delayed requested a 2 hour later checkout was told that it eas absolutely mot possible because Saturday is a vet busy day for the hotel.  Can‚Äôt understand why when checking in on a Tuesday no room availability at 8:30 pm while impossible to give a 1 hour extension on a Tuesday.now I understand why Caesars is headed for bankruptcy customer service matters!
50,First trip to Las Vegas and stayed at Cesar Palace . Great room great location great value. If you want to experience the Vegas strip and be in the middle of all the action.....this is your spot. Short trip from the airport.
50,Caesars has the best overall experience. From the rooms to the floor and then to their amazing sports book you can‚Äôt go wrong. Only place I want to gamble and watch my favorite sports teams. The buffet is amazing and me being a diamond member it‚Äôs even more beneficial!
50,We enjoyed our stay at caesar palace. Originally we were booked for julius tower room but when we checked in and told them that we came to vegas to celebrate my aunt's 70th bday and asked if we can get a complimentary upgrade or just better room view....we were offered both. We were upgraded to palace tower with a great view of the pool. We had an amazing stay and will definitely go back.
10,I have been very loyal to Caesars Entertainment for many years but that loyalty is coming to an end this trip. I visit Las Vegas and a Caesars property's on average once a month I like to go out there and blow off some steam keep in mind I live in Florida so I am a 4 hour flight each way on average I would say I spend about $4000 per trip on gambling food entertainment tips etc. Upon checkout I was told that they would not comp me my room charges for approx. $125 for overpriced food at there property. I spend thousands of dollars at your casinos each month and your not even willing to comp me for a few cheap eats over the course of being there for 5 days The excuse they gave me was I play at multiple Caesars property's upon my visit and they are not able to comp be because of it regardless why I come to Vegas for the variety and there all owned by the same place so it should not matter which property I play at. I told the hotel check out attendant that they will loose me as a customer over this and they act like they could care less also if you stay there avoid the Forum Tower the room #5921 or at least is out dated and shabby paint chipping off the doors shows heavy signs of wear no usb ports in the room to charge a device and the elevator to the room had broken glass panel with duck tape over it and the ceiling was pealing not a good look Caesars. As far as striving for a Diamond status just pay the resort fees and play the lower limit tables you get very little for your money. I think I have spent around $25000 this year and have received very little in return never even offered a host I think I am going to try MGM and see if they have more to offer.
10,Bad service gave us the wrong room and wouldn‚Äôt change it. Charge us for upgrade for a better view. When it wasn‚Äôt even a nice view. Gave us an accessible room. Made us felt so uncomfortable in the room. Very disappointing for our first time family trip.
50,My first stay in the Forum Tower. The view was wonderful and the location was perfect for the pools shops and restaurants. With two comfortable queen beds the spacious room had all the amenities. This tower is comparable to the Augustus Tower where we previously stayed.
50,We stayed as a family of four for 3 nights on arrival we were upgraded to a room overlooking the pool with two bathrooms and great views üòäLovely clean room friendly staff great pools and perfect location.  Can definitely recommend the Cheesecake Factory it has great food.
50,Our stay was great but moe made it even better. He want out of his way to make us feel like family. Even when he was super busy waiting on other tables. Thanks Moe! You made our stay even though you were so busy!
30,"Our room was just adequate...nothing special. The employees were not anxious to be helpful and they were really only interested in the VIP's. When we went to the buffet our waiter was never at our table. Two tables over were some VIP's and he was constantly hovering over them. I was really surprised to see that....the ""little "" people make up the bulk of the business and this ""little person "" will not stay with Caesars again. I just finished a trip to Vegas a week ago and I stayed at New York New York. I loved it and plan to stay there again. ALL THE EMPLOYEES treat each guest like a VIP!."
30,Booked an Octavius room. The bed was very saggy the alarm clock radio didn't work and the TV was wonky. While it was nice to have good size table in the room one side of the table leg had a piece of wood chipped off. The bathroom fixtures were not affixed properly. Bathroom amenities were minimal.
50,When I come to Vegas. We always stay at saesars palace . It is my favorite place to stay. We always invite family or friends to come stay there. We like the buffet and restaurants there. Also most employees there very helpful. We would love to have food in baccarat vip room. It‚Äôs nice to serve after 1 am .
50,Ceasar's Palace is a beautiful friendly hotel and casino. The staff are very friendly and courteous. The one thing we needed is a refrigerator. No refrigerator available for my husband's insulin. No coffee available (complimentary in the room); and the water in the swimming pool was way too cold. It should have some kind of heating.
40,Room was nice location was great. Enjoyed riding the monorail and the bus. Had a good time all through the strip plus old downtown. Freemont experience is a place that nobody should miss out when going to Vegas.
20,"I will give this place credit for its location and the size of the rooms in the Palace Tower. Other than that it has the smell of sewage around the property especially near the Palace Tower pool entrance.    They have gotten very money hungry; nearly everything you touch will cost money. We got charged for internet access even though the first two devices were supposed to be included. They would not correct the charge. Both self and valet parking costs money. You pay a ""resort fee"" which does not give you access to the gym.    The bubbling bath tub is great except it turns itself on randomly and will not turn off. You have to wait for 15 minutes and it will shut itself off.    There is a pool party that requires another fee but it was dead."
30,Room was great. Very nice location. Sink kept clogging up. Told house keeper about situation but nothing was done. Very disappointed with the failure to display notice that the snacks and water were not complimentary but had to be paid for.
40,Stayed at Caesar‚Äôs palace on Labor Day public holiday with family of 4 . Kids loved the spectacular pools and check in was very easy considering it was Labor Day. Rooms were spacious and you couldn‚Äôt hear outside noise at all and beds were comfy . Overall it was a good stay
40,It was a good experience and enjoyed my meal at Hell‚Äôs Kitchen. The building was beautiful and the room had a great view of the Bellagio fountains. The fountains does an evening show which is spectacular. We had a sky view.
50,Caesars is a great hotel and casino. Love the food restaurants shops and entertainment it offers. Would recommend anyone going to Vegas to stay there or if not at least visit it. All kinds of venues for whatever you like!
50,Beds were extremely comfortable the shower pressure was terrific the cabana we rented (J6) at the Jupiter pool was a little shabby. The Augustus Tower is very convienient to the pool and the buffet and there is a Starbucks right by the elevator banks. There is also an exit right around the corner so you can walk down the block and accross the street to get to Bellagio.
50,Our experience was great. The disability room was the best I have been in during a trip to Vegas. We had two very good dining experiences with Gordon Ramsay‚Äôs Pub and Grill and Mr. Chow. My granddaughter especially loved the pool she chose (there is more than one).
40,We were comped a four night stay (we paid for one extra night) between Aug 31 - Sept 5 2019 which was our first time staying at Caesars on our 15th trip to Las Vegas. With such a great central location on the strip we have wanted to stay at Caesars for quite a while and finally got our chance. We have been slowly migrating from MGM properties over to CET. Firstly the check-in was a little slow but painless and the Front Desk person was friendly. We asked about an upgrade or a move to a better tower but were told due to the holiday weekend nothing was available but it was suggested if we wanted to come back after Monday they could probably find something. We decided we would stay put. We were given a room on the 9th floor in the Julius tower. The room was small even by Vegas standards but it was clean and fairly modern. I was told that they were remodeled a couple of years ago. The single king room we got comes with a single sink and shower only. The room has a single cup Keurig machine but the pods supplied by the hotel cost a small fortune so bring your own pods Splenda and creamer! No fridge and a small closet and 3 drawers for your clothes. The view was‚Ä¶ well you can see the picture below meh.  The property itself is pretty large with many places to eat drink gamble and see shows and musical acts and it has a top flight night club as well. We tried several locations to eat during our stay but the best by far was Hell‚Äôs Kitchen of Gordon Ramsey fame expensive but the food was spectacular!  We enjoyed seeing ‚ÄúMr. Las Vegas‚Äù Wayne Newton doing his show at Cleopatra‚Äôs Barge a perfect intimate venue to see the aging star. He made us laugh took us down memory lane of Las Vegas in it‚Äôs heyday of Elvis Sinatra and the Rat Pack and sang many of his hits. My wife was very glad we got to see the show.  Overall we enjoyed our stay could it have been better? Sure but there is nothing that we could truly complain about nothing that went awry or sideways so would we stay again? The simple answer is yes.
10,Property is huge and beautiful but the staff wasn't. Acted as if they were doing us a favor for being there during a holiday weekend. Spend your money elsewhere. There are better places to stay in Vegas.
40,Nice hotel with lots of amenities and friendly people. Our first room was a smoking room and we booked non-smoking but they handled it immediately. Buffet was nice after having to wait a long time in line (the platinum line) but worth the wait. I would stay there a.
50,Everything was great no problems visited casino food places and the pools were great. Drinks at the pool are a little pricey ( but didn't slow us down ) but then it was vaca. ! Would highly recommend to everyone Caesars is a great place.
50,Very clean casino. Very friendly staff. The pools are beautiful. The snack shop has very good food. Good restaurants. Lots of slot machine choices. Great entertainment. Great drink servers. Lots of shops.
40,First time staying at Caesars Palace. Here for business so i could only enjoy a few restaurants and a little black jack. Dealers are all fun and nice fun side bets and they even had some $10 tables. The Homestead steak house was very good and we also ate at Nobu. The Nobu experience wasn't as good as Nobu @ Hard Rock.
50,Everything was great with the exception of the service in the Monte Cristo Private Dining Room.Room was great. Check in at he Diamond Lounge was fast and efficient. Food was excellent at both the Steakhouse and Mesa.
50,Room was clean & employees were friendly and helpful.  The property overall was in great shape.  Rooms for a diamond were ok but halls to get to the room was trashed.  I would recommend staying at the property just don't wonder the halls...hehehe
50,How beautiful. The environment and team make this place special. We enjoyed our trip from the shopping to the gambling. The building itself is just amazing and very well maintained. We would definitely come back and stay again.
20,not happy at all very poor customer service and treated like we were not good enough to be in there establishment I really enjoyed cesars years ago now i will probably not step foot in there again very sad
50,Pool was very relaxing cabanas are worth the price. Great location lots of nice restaurants and amazing shopping. Hotel rooms were upgraded recently been to Las Vegas many times Caesars is definitely one of the better resorts.
50,Caesars Palace has everything you could want for your Vegas Stay! Beautiful hotel fun casino great shopping delicious dining and variety of entertainment. We always have to eat at Bobby Flay‚Äôs Mesa Grill and it was a big hit with all of us again this visit. We went to Cleopatra‚Äôs Barge and saw America‚Äôs Got Talent Season 13 Top Ten finalist Daniel Emmet on his Opening Night August 25. Daniel‚Äôs show ‚ÄúAll that I am‚Äù features a variety of music from ballads showstoppers and rock with live band and some guest performers. He is a gifted powerhouse vocalist who puts on one of the best shows ever! Daniel has sang with a Marie Osmond a few times and she was in the audience enjoying the show too.  Daniel with rapper Faded Breezie performed their new song ‚ÄúThe People‚Äù which was amazing and the audience all got involved. It will be a big hit when it is released! Our group loved the show so much we went back the next night. Yes it is that fantastic and so much fun! It is a limited engagement only 3 shows left ((September 6 22 23) but I am guessing they will be scheduling more shows. Ticket prices are a real value ($59) for the high quality entertainment experience. Great intimate venue about 140 seats really not a bad seat in the whole place.
50,We had so much gambling at this casino. We may not have won much but my new husband and I walked around and played different slots and then he played Rolette. We loved the design and the feel of the whole place.
50,During my most recent visit to Las Vegas I stayed in a Caesar's Palace Palace Tower room and had a great experience. The room was comped which made it even better!  My Palace Tower room was newly remodeled and it was beautiful. The bathroom was a very large with marble floors. There was a nice jacuzzi tub and separate shower.  The room had a nice sitting area with a sectional couch and comfortable chair. My view was of the pool area and a glimpse of the Strip. This is obviously a very large hotel and so walking is involved. Also in the evening it can get a bit crowded in the public areas. I enjoyed video poker at the Lobby Bar Vista and the Sports Bar and was especially impressed with the friendly bartenders at the lobby bar and Vista.  Lots of things to do from gambling to great restaurants and shopping. The location is in the middle of the Strip with a bridge across the street to Cromwell and across to the Belagio. The Diamond registration was quick and easy and the entire experience was first class. I had a great time and hope to stay again soon.
40,I stayed at Caesar's for Labor Day weekend and greatly enjoyed my time there and the service was wonderful throughout my stay. I enjoyed all of the restaurants I visited and would recommend anyone who hasn't been to Vegas to stay here at least once.
50,My wife and I go to vegas often enough to know where to go this is a must. We stay at the Bellagio but since they closed petrossians Caesars has become our go to hotel. great rooms atmosphere and of course food and entertainment choices. Shopping is easy at the Forum Shoppes and the casino floor is large. Plenty of things to do in the area.
50,Pleasant experience at Ceasars. Room was very nice and clean. Upon arriving our smoke dector was malfunctioning. Fixed it immediately. Great people on staff. The battery on outer door went dead. Staff had a locksmith on sight in minutes. Fixed and we were on our way. Mgmt and staff couldn't have been more helpful.
20,We mentioned that we are coming for a babymoon no congratulations at the desk.. we were greeted by a very tired girl that tried to upgrade us .. we got the worst room in forum tower with horrible moldy smell since I‚Äôm pregnant i just cant understand why they send us to this old  smelly room since the beginning.. felt like a punishment coz we didn‚Äôt want the upgrade. We were back at the front desk asking to switch the room and got the answer that is possible only if we pay extra. After couple hours and throwing up i came back to the front desk and thank god for the 3ed person that was there he immediately gave us other room in Julius tower that was closer to front desk and to the elevator same sized room just without the smell. After two nights we checked in to other hotel . We are very disappointed at the service that was rude also at check out by some older guy that was very unpleasant by the people at the casino when we asked where are the rooms at the Forum tower they send us to Forum shops. this was our second stay at the Ceasar‚Äôs and definitely the last. Although the pool and the Forum shops were great we are not going to except rudeness and unpleasant service . Such a shame !! And advise for the hotel  renovation much needed in the Forum tower!! Don‚Äôt put people in those horrible rooms not healthy at all.
50,Excelent service clean and frienly employees nice pool view form our room one of the best sports books Victor the bartender at the Palms Restaurant he is the best great service and frienly conversation real nice casino!!
50,The Customer Service at Ceasars Palace is STELLAR! The staff at check-in to the restaurants to the casino are very pleasant attentive and helpful. I loved my stay here. I would definitely recommend Ceasars. The rooms were lovely and well stocked. This is a place that you cannot pass up if your visiting Vegas.
50,Don‚Äôt stay in Palace Towers if you can help it!    Dined nightly at Diamond Lounge. Food mediocre at best and sparse. You need to up your game here. Caesars properties back East have fabulous spreads in the Diamond Lounges. Shame on you.    Also NO COFFEE in Diamond Registration? Really how cheap can you get? Again shame on you. Makes you look like chiselers.
50,Room was nice but found clothing and old towels in the room. Room service cleaned and took care of it right away. Had a kids pool area which was nice and clean. Customer service was excellent and took care of any problems right away. Will stay here again.
50,Great experience friendly courteous employees nice restaurants great pools. Loose slots big casino with various games. Rooms very comfortable shower strong and hot. Overall a great experience all employees very helpful.
50,Room was excellent and spacious awesome marble floors many selections of games to gamble from. Shopping centers are near by. Be ready to spend money as most places near by are more expensive than you‚Äôre usual hotels/resorts. Nonetheless  great experience
20,Decided to tag along to Vegas with my husband for his business trip with my two kids in tow. After a 5 hour flight from across the country we landed in Vegas at 11pm all we wanted to do was get to bed. Upon reserving our room we specifically requested non smoking and when we got to our room it was a smoking room. We called down to the front desk and was told they didn‚Äôt have any rooms available. It wasn‚Äôt until we told them we were going to check out that they then decided to accommodate us. What is the deal with that? Also the room they then put us in had a used bar of soap in the shower!    Pool side service at the bar was horrible. Three bartenders not paying attention to who came first and I waited 20 minutes for a drink after being overlooked 10 times I then had to raise my voice to tell the bartender that I‚Äôve been standing there waiting. (I was standing right in front of him the whole time). I‚Äôm starting to think that they get so much business here that they don‚Äôt seem to really care about anything anymore. I will not be coming back.
50,We spent a day in the pool and I don't know how they do it but the water is COLD! But with the Las Vegas heat it really works out. The Jupiter pool is the only that doesn't seem to be refrigerated although the main Neptune pool was well toleratable for our elementary school aged kids. It's a great place to just laze the day away.
50,We always stay at Caesar‚Äôs Palace and it‚Äôs always a great experience! From the beautiful outdoor pools to the fine dining they do it well.    I would recommend staying in the Forum Tower with a view of the pool.
50,Every time we stay here we are welcomed warmly at the front desk. We‚Äôve stayed at other big hotels but Caesars is the only one that asks what we are celebrating. They always impress us with the rooms they select for us and make sure we have everything we need to ensure a pleasant stay. This morning we were assisted by Tangela and she helped get our Vegas vacation started in the right direction. We made a new friend today and we hope to see her on our future visits.    We continue to return because they are hands down the best hotel and casino on the strip.    Steven & Michelle Likens
50,my room is the best and all games is very nice hotel and people is the best y like and come again about the location & amenities is okthe service and experienced in las vegas and caesar palace my family and friends is very happy
50,Very clean Hotel and clean room. Except you need to bring your own robe. If you are looking for clean & fresh Hotel w/good location. Caesars Palace also has good restaurants with variety of selections.
50,Beautiful resort fun casino great restaurants. Just a wonderful experience. The Augustus Tower guest rooms are lovely and comfortable. Also Caesar's has an excellent location on the Strip. The shopping areas are so beautiful even if you're just browsing it will be a fun experience. My favorite place to stay in Vegas.
50,Love Vandergarden Love the slot games Club Omnia was very exciting. I would live to work here. The employees were always smiling I like that. I will come back and visit soon very soon.    Love The Queen
50,Very grandiose in stature. Beautiful grounds and indoor shopping! Looks like being in an Italian market. Large rooms and the location is centrally located to get to a lot of other attractions We enjoyed a meal at the Chef Ramsey's Pub. It was soo good! We enjoyed going out at night to see the Bellagio fountains Paris and Harrah's Cant wait to come back..
50,The room service reception parking casino floor games everything is the best of the best in a gaming and resort experience. Very highly recommend Caesar's over other casinos in Vegas I have stayed at most however only Caesars or Caesars properties for the last 14 years due to the exceptional experience!
40,overall good experience def not exceptional. For the prices of this property id of liked to of been catered to a lil better. But overall its a clean and good property. Location on the strip is ideal. Many food options although very pricey.
10,As you check out check your bill they added an additional 300 dollars in hidden fees they said for internet gym etc . Never going back to Caesars Palace again . The place is a scam  9 dollar coffee!
50,Great place to stay and gamble lovely hotel. Machines were hitting quite often. The staff was extremely curtious and polite. Loved how clean everything was. Only thing I would change is free coffee in the room for morning time after long evening especially when spending the amount of money you leave on the floor.
40,This hotel is a great option to stay at the strip. Everything is near from this hotel. The service is great ant it is a very convinient ubication in the whole strip. The room was clean comfortable and just for a very reasonable price.
50,Love this place great games great pool great bars great restaurants great shows great service great rooms fun time with friends and lots of options easy to get to from the airport great bar selection and
50,Hey if your looking and expect the best then I highly recommend Caesars Palace. You appreciate Caesars Palace more when experiencing the lack of professional and customer service so many others will bestow
50,Love the rooms and service. You can never go wrong with Caesars Palace. Will definitely stay again! Amazing experience from check in all the way to check out. Which checking out is a breeze. Love the decor of the rooms Omnia night club was nice too.
50,This property is awesome!!!! The staff is very attentive to your needs and very friendly and courtious!!! This property is one of the superb properties that offers everything that you need and want and if you need to get anywhere from this property it is very easy.
40,Room is lean. Very good service. It is very a nice place. Pool looks so fantastic. The food is so good and yummy. The buffet has so many kind of food. The seafoods are so fresh. All the deserts are so yummy.
50,In the middle of the strip you can't go wrong staying here. The hotel has many restaurants and the spa huge bonus. The pool is very clean and big enough you have your own room to relax. We have stayed here several times and it never disappoints.
50,Going through the front entrance was great you get that really magnificent feel to it. Then the front desk receptionist was great even upgraded us to a great room for a small fee. Also the room was very clean and up to date!
50,Comfortable room great resort experience awaits guests  S at Caesars palace.  Every thing I expect is available and more at Caesars palace. I will visit again and again to get a few days here and there to unwind and enjoy the moment.
40,Had a spectacular view of the Bellagio fountains. Employees were friendly and so efficient. Restaurants are kind of high even for Cafe food. Did enjoy the Hells Kitchen even got to me one of the winners from the Hells Kitchen competition.
50,Room was off in secluded Augustus Tower. Loved it. Once you go around the corner from the lobby and lobby caf√© it seems like a different hotel. The room was great. Views outstanding. Caesars location center strip can't be beat.
50,everyone who you came in contact with be it the hotel staff people in the restaurants dealers/servers all made you feel like a high roller and were happy that you were staying at caesar's palace.....
50,The location of the hotel is perfect for getting around on foot or by taxi. Close to walk to most places.The restaurant selection in the hotel is amazing and all very good. Prettiest casino in Vegas in my opinion! The pool area is beautiful with lounge chairs food and drink service and a large sized pool. The beds are very comfortable. The feature that I loved is the built in TV in the bathroom mirror very cool! The service is impecable. Will continue going back to Caesar's on future visits.
50,Las Vegas is a place that must be seen at least once in your lifetime and I would recommend that you give the Caesars properties a try. They have excellent entertainment and dining. all the employees care about your stay and they put in an effort to make you happy. A truly great organization unmatched anywhere in the world.
50,check in was fast - room was excellent - all employees knew Caesars products and were nice!  slot machines were varied and in excellent condition. ate at Rao's and buffet breakfast at Giata's - both outstanding in particular buffet.
40,Beautiful and convenient location. My only complaint is the cigaret smoke is everywhere. If you are sensitive to smoke this might not be the place for you. The entire casino smells of cigaret as soon as you walk in.
50,My favorite thing was the Absinthe show!! I will see it the next time I go too! The main pool is cold but refreshing with the 110 degree weather! The food was good but extremely pricey! I feel like we could have found some better stuff to eat for the money we spent. 65 dollars for breakfast for 2 and 125 for lunch buffet for 2. That‚Äôs a bit more than I was expecting but it was good!
50,We had a great experience at the bar and on the caribou floor. Our bartender and cocktail waitress were both excellent. The property is very high class and I would recommend it to anyone that plans on visiting Las Vegas.
50,One of the best properties I been too  Decent Room sizes for party of 4 with two queen beds and sitting area  Well decorated room and no need to mention about whole experience of hotel and shopping complex in it  One must visit
40,Caesers has everything in one place. Dining gambling & shopping. Barely walked on strip because there was so much to do. Go to Hells Kitchen which is in front of Caesars. Great food & wonderful service.
50,Extremely satisfied with our stay and how we were taken care of. Moses out at the Neptune Pool took such great care of us and always checked on us to make sure we were being taken care of. Our cabana was such a relief for us to be able to get out of the sun for a bit. Can not wait to go back.
40,Arrived at Caesars after Yosemite to finish our road trip.  At check in we were upgraded to the Palace wing rooms were amazing and clean with views of the pool  we were advised that if we touched anything in the mini bar we would be charged as I asked about if we wanted to use the fridge our selves the check in lady said she would sort something. 10minutes after being in our room a mini fridge arrived which was perfect for storing our own drinks.    Pools were great and there were always sunbeds but sometimes just not in the sun but its that hot in the summer you want to cool off in the pool.    Food and drink - plenty of options we used the food court for lunch with various fast food places and then tried Mesa Grill which was very nice just a little pricey. Drinks were expensive but we expected that being Vegas and a main hotel on the strip.    Location was great right in the middle of the Strip    only Negative I can say is we were woken up on our last night by our neighbours banging so at least they had a good night
40,I enjoyed my stay at caesar but my shower drain need to have been cleaned. I do see how the maid could have cleaned the shower and not notice the standing water. If you had a cut on your feet that is not a safe condition to have to shower in standing water. The clock in the room did not work.
50,visited Ceasers Palace and stay at palace tower. I had beauriful pool and little bit of strip view also. spacious room with whirlpool and big closet and storage. Very comfortable sysy. Pool closed early enough to not bother my rest. Lots of good food and places to hang out.
50,July in Vegas is insanely hot and Caesars' Palace Hotel and Casino is the Jackpot of luxury and amenities. Do not be discouraged when you cast eyes on the lines for check-in the flow is seamless. The hotel has multiple shops a variety of restaurants shows with beautiful rooms and amenities. Booked a suite and upgraded to a better view and higher floor; nice and quiet-quite serene for a Casino stay. Excellent Staff!
50,I love Caesars Palace! I travel to Vegas about 5 times a year and this year I decided to take my sister for her 21st birthday. Patrick at check in was amazing! He made her first Vegas experience very special. He is also very funny. We stayed at the Julius tower which is the newly remodeled room. It was very clean and comfortable. I moved to the Palace tower the night after we got there because my boyfriend met us there a day later. That tower is even more nicer the room is bigger and has a double walk in shower with two bathrooms and a bidet in one restroom. The pool was very nice as well. Overall we had a great stay! Can't wait to go back
50,This was the first time we have stayed at Caesar's Palace and we loved everything!. We stayed in the newly renovated Palace Tower. The pool entrance is right across from the elevators so if the pool is your thing you want this tower. We stayed on the 26th floor with a beautiful pool view. So many restaurants to choose from inside the hotel. We ate at Rao's and Gordon Ramsay Pub. Both are excellent and the pub has very good happy hour prices. We highly recommend!
30,First time at Caesar‚Äôs but have spent many vacations in Vegas.  The property itself is beautiful. However I am unsure if I would return for the following reasons ‚Äì  The property is almost TOO large. To walk from the pool or to just get a cup of coffee is a long one!  The restaurants are nice and plentiful but there is NO place to get a reasonable priced cup of coffee (most were $7-8 for a small coffee!) I go to Vegas frequently and I go to vacation and spend money. I get it. But sometimes the pricing for things like that is just too much.  We were charged double one night at the buffet. We went to the front desk to try and get it removed but because we‚Äôd put it on our charge card (and not charged to the room) they would not help us without the paper receipt.  We did a lot of gambling (both slots and cards) but the rewards are not what they used to be at all.  Unsure ‚Äì but my thoughts are that we may skip Caesars on our next visit.
50,The room was fantastic and Gorgeous. Staff was friendly and kind. I arrived as a 29 year old and engaged; I left 30 years old and married! What a wild weekend and already not excited to be home.. but maybe my feet are! We also spent a day at a Caesars cabana and our friends took us to too absinthe (outside Caesars)! It was fantastic. Friday the 30th- woke up early it was my 30th birthday played buffalo and won $200 right off! Thank god because the drinks were expensive cabana the day earlier but it was worth the relaxation (Jupiter Pool)! We went saw both set of parents at their AirBNB and planning stuff but my guys ended up planning an amazing birthday/bachelor party at Caesars and even gifted me a bottle of Johnny Walker Blue with the wedding date! They didn‚Äôt let me spend a dime except gambling! No luck and was down $150 but still it was awesome playing at Caesars. To be honest I've never spent so much on a hotel room but hey I was getting married and I turned 30! #LikeACaesar
50,After having our flight delayed and then cancelled we needed to find a room fast. I booked online and when we arrived at check in Julia P. heard our struggles and gave us a complementary room upgrade to a king suite in the Octavius tower. The room was beautiful and we definitely appreciated the upgrade and comfortability of the new room after our stressful day of figuring out how to get home. Thank you again Julia!
20,They clearly don't actually wash the drinking glasses in the rooms there was multiple lip marks on the glass and they were rotten dirty. I expected more from a hotel that charges so much for their rooms.
50,Fantastic property that has it all!  Beautiful and updated guest room and suite different gorgeous pools for your mood access to the best shops in steps and outstanding restaurants and lounges on site
50,Julia of Front Desk was exceptional. She was very professional helpful and accommodating. Our room was very spacious and had a very relaxed atmosphere. The good view of the pool was a plus. The bed and pillows were very comfortable.
50,Julia of Front Desk at Caesar‚Äôs Palace who checked us in was exceptional. She was very helpful and attentive. The room was well planned and had a relaxing atmosphere. We had a good view. The bed and pillows were very comfortable.
30,Caesars Palace only has the name behind it. Rooms are outdated and the place is too busy/crowded to be able to give good customer service to everyone. Price wise is definitely not worth it especially with newer hotels where probably rooms are nicer. Dinged and scrapped furniture tv in bathroom mirror not working late housekeeping and bell staff too busy to answer in a nice/pleasant way. At the bar Americano? i waited for about 5 minutes for someone to help me. There was a young guy staring at me but no help. After 5 minutes he came and said to me have you been helped? Really?...Long story short I don't think he was a bartender because he went and ask someone else to do the drink. What else he did? he told the bartender to make it virgin so i got my drink with no alcohol!... needless to say i did not come back to that bar nor will I come back to the caesars palace. My money will be spend better somewhere else.
50,Cesars Palace - staff willing to help - registration staff very professional - pool area well kept very clean - great they provided towels - pool area staff very nice - great amount of lounger chairs provided at pool
50,When you celebrate your anniversary the only Augustus Spa Suite in Caesar's Palace is the best way to do it... August 17 2019 we checked in the hotel and for 2 people the 1500+ sq/ft room was a luxury... the living room area was relaxing the bedroom space was calming the jacuzzi room was sexy and the sauna (yes your own sauna room in the suite) was so inviting... the only time we left the room was to eat out... it's like a luxury home away from home...
40,"I was at Caesars Palace for a work conference. My room was a long walk from the center of activity but once there it was beautiful and very clean and the bed was sooooo comfortable. One day I had been in meeting for close to 12 hours and I was absolutely beat. I got back to my room and decided to order room service. My order was a grilled cheese sandwich tomato soup and a root beer. . . that's it! When it came to my room the total for the order before tip was over $65! While I loved my stay at Caesars this is my warning to anyone contemplating ordering ""in"". . . it will cost you!"
10,My name is Bright S we are platinum members for total rewards. i made my reservation on July 27 paid 630 approx for suite 2 kids myself and wife. when check in on Saturday 31st August 2019 Catherine said it was a studio suite and I bed i explained to her that was not that was told to us. Similar issues where also happening at the time i was at the counter. Their response we are completely sold out and we cannot do anything about. I asked for a roll away bed they wanted to charge me 30 per night for 2 night when asking for a manager they waived and they said they will send it I had to call and text a couple times before i received it 2 hours later. I understand it was a holiday weekend and they are overbooked. Being in service industry i would it is very important not be overbooked and take care of the clients with out which there will be no business.I am not sure if I will ever get a call back from the the manager but here is my number 562 287 9849. i think they can do better.
10,Horrible view of the hotel . Room was really far away from the car to get luggage . Had to drag luggage through the whole hotel and no body helped with the luggage. Other hotels offer the cart and this one did not . Plus it was a horrible view
30,"1 - we were in Octavius tower -- the room was very nice (but a bit of a walk from the front desk)  2 - the gym was also very nice  3 - i can't stand that the cashier and service desks have special lines so that they ""seven star""members (or whatever the name is for people who give way to much money to the casino) can cut in front of us -- i understand the resort wants to treat the high rollers well but don't do it by rubbing it in our face give them a special office where they can go and get kid glove care  4 - there should be attendants at the pool. we watched (from our room) people put towels on prime chairs and then not return for hours. The attendants should put a timer on an empty chair it the timer has not been re-set by the guest within thirty minutes (or so) the attendant should open up the chair for someone who is there and wants to use it. (until they start to do that i guess you will have to go down early to reserve a chair -- because there were none available either day we were there)  5 - the topless pool is gone (if you happen to care)  6 - the dance club opens late at night (I believe it is called omnia) -- if you want to save some money on an expensive vegas show grab a seat at a machine near omnia on a friday or saturday night to watch the crowd entering the club -- you willl see some amazing outfits  7 - believe it or not our ice bucket had an inch or so of water in it when we arrived -- kind of gross  8 - despite my concerns we will probably stay here again next time -- the location is great  9 - be careful to check your bill -- there were several mistakes on ours (although they corrected them all -- it wasn't an easy process)"
50,What a great property! And a wonderful surprise when we were upgraded to a 2000 square foot 2 story suite with 7 TVs a full kitchen and bar and a full size pool table. Staff here is wonderful. So much to do and we highly recommend Carmines in the Forum Shops for a family style dinner.
20,Emma at Caesars Palce is fantastic. We were at Caesars at the end of July and middle of August .She was cheerfull helpfull and full of help. BUT the rest of Caesars has gone to crap fast. We have stayed there 4 to 5 times a year since 1998 that place used to be fantastic but since being bought out the last 2 years has been going downhill fast. The place is dirty there is no beverage service on the casino floor  i put $600 in a slot and lost it all before one waitress came by on 2 straight nights the carpet on our floor was coming up charge for the maid the slot areas are filthy we had to clear bottles glasses dirty ashtrys away ourselfs there just doesnt seem to be any employees anywhere . The diamond lounge now takes 25.000 points instead of 15000 points to get in for free it just seems like its all about the bottom line there now. WE will come our usual 2 more time in 2019 and if its the same  we will be switching to the Palazzo.
50,We had a geat time in Vegas at Caesars Palace. We celebrated my birthday there for the second year in a row. This is definately the highlight of the year for me. Caesars has friendly staff with excellent amenities. Can't wait for the next trip!
50,Returned to Vegas for 20th wedding anniversary.Hotel is beautiful. Upgraded to a room in the Octavius  Tower. Worth the money but if you have difficulty walking this is not for you. Check in was unusually long. Many choices for eating including a food court when you dont want to spend an inordinate amount of money. Would recommend Bobby Flays also Gordon Ramseys Pub and Grill.
50,Went to Caesars for our annual Father and Son weekend in Vegas. Everything was great room was great food was great. Resort Fee is a little much but it is Caesars after all. Valentina is a waitress in the pool area if you get a chance to be served by her please tip her well. She is awesome and represents the highest of standards and service going above and beyond for everyone of the people she took care of.
50,Although we have stayed at this hotel before this trip was better than ever. The check-in process can be tricky with the kiosk system during peak hours. Patrick guided us through the process with such patience and kindness; he made it a breeze for us. The entire hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Great trip!
10,Rooms old. Garbage left in hallways three days. Incredibly high prices on meals no matter where you go. Stay away. We had to walk in excessive heat to the Mirage next door to find reasonably priced meals.
50,We went there on our anniversary seen one of the best shows I‚Äôve seen in my life playing in a poker tournament in both made it to the final table and one money food was excellent overall great experience
30,Almost 2 hours to check in at 1:30am then another 20 mins at the desk. Was upgraded but not because of the delay because I was mistakenly booked into an accessible room that I didn't require but someone was waiting for. No one apologized for the delay in the process nor did they thank me for my patience. The hotel is amazing the shops and casino are fantastic. They just need to improve staffing at the main desk.
40,Good experience overall. It would be nice if table minimums were lower. Parking should be free. A lot more people would be there if not for the parking fee. Comped rooms should not have a resort fee. There should be an easier way to walkbfrom one casino to another also.
40,Really had a relaxing enjoyable time while visiting Caesars palace what really impressed me was the overall cleanliness of the place and I was well taken care of by the staff the architecture of the building is stunningly beautiful had a great time
30,Awesome place catching an Uber is a pain service and staff not so great. The entrance to ceasars is a pain but it has everything you could want within the casino. Sports book is decent and poker room has good games and daily tournaments if you are into poker.
40,The room was excellent the pool was nice. The staff was very helpful and courteous.I did find that the dining experience was quite pricey. Eleven dollars for a bottle of beer seemed to be expensive to say the least!!
40,We found employees to be very indifferent to our needs and the valet was unorganized and slow when we went to the pool we couldn't find any shade or any umbrellas to rent aside from that the facility is georgous.
50,Love visiting Ceasars Palace. Very central to everything on the strip. Everything very clear and room service everyday. Nice ambience overall. Would recommend Ceasars Palace. Lots of good food lots or tables and slots...with lot of jackpot winners!
50,The rooms are clean and big amenities are very good there are plenty of restaurants to chosse from. Buffett is the best. Selection of food at buffet is the best. It is close to all other hotels. The spa and swimming pool are clean.
40,View overlooking pool was great.  Room was clean and beautiful...but would be better with a coffee pot not to include a charge for Keurig.  Nice to have an option for no cleaning services for length of stay.
20,6162. Octavian tower. We actually found a service man in our room even though we put out the occupied sign. What decent hotel does that? When I complained they said that they have to do maintenance. Why can't they change the a/c filters between guests or when they make up the room? We also had a stuffed up sink. NOT A VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE. Then they offered $50 worth of overpriced drinks. What a RIP off.
40,Property very nice but hospitality just satisfactory.. Rooms very big and spacious. Parking a hassle and elevators to rooms confusing. Property centrally located on the strip and convenient access to other casinos.
50,our 2nd stay at Ceasers love it pools are amazing and we rented a Cabana for the day which was amazing drinks in fridge( non alcoholic ) and our host came with a beautiful fruit tray in the afternoon.
50,Property was the best as far as the Caesars Entertainment properties go. Everything was well kept. Service was excellent. Very clean. Tables limits a little high but that‚Äôs to be expected there. I‚Äôd stay again. But I‚Äôll be at Planet Hollywood in November‚Äôs
40,Caesars is top notch. Not only is it beautifully designed but is in a.great location on the strip. I definitely recommend and the room was also satisfactory as well. Pools are amazing and the shops are a pleasure to stroll through.
10,Customer service!!!! From the time I checked in to the time I went to the Total Rewards desk horrible horrible customer service! This place use to mean something to me. I've been coming here since I was 21 I'm 45 now. It was my mother's 69th birthday and I mentioned it approximately at least 3 times not for an upgrade or any type of perk but a common courtesy for someone to say oh happy birthday miss while checking in at the desk. I even tipped this no personality person $20 like I always do when I check into a hotel. Such dry customer service. Then the lady working the Total Rewards desk was new (which was fine) and she had her manager 5 feet behind her sitting at a desk and wouldn't get up to come explain my rewards and the programs with all it's benefits and instead made this new employee walk back and forth at least 5-7 times to answer my questions consistently. What kind of customer service is all of this? I receive a concierge text and later find out I'm talking to a robot and not a real person who keeps answering my questions and complaints with sorry hope the day gets better??? Another casino host tells me after I explain things to him to definitely do the survey that will follow my stay their and that they really pay attention to those and read them. I asked him what's the logic in that when I'm already gone instead of taking care of me now? A blank expression on his face like uhhh? So sad that this place which meant a lot to me visiting Vegas each time has gone down in simple customer service and attention.... i will definitely be writing more negative reviews on Trip Adviser and every other website with reviews I can find. Maybe then someone smart will step up and restructure this fallen empire!
50,Finally got to bring my girlfriend to Vegas!< Short 24 hour stop over at Caesars and it was everything you'd want - Great food awesome show gambling and an all night party! We will definitely be back!
50,Clean rooms with fine linens. Excellent service from housekeeping. Great views from the Augusta tower. Wonderful selection of restaurants ....lots of shopping and fun atmosphere. Excellent Casino games with lots of variety.
50,Excellent experience on the 66th floor. Food was delicious gaming was fun and shows were great! Will be planning more visits to stay here in the future. Had a blast and already looking forward to our next visit.
50,Overall best place to stay on the strip. Good restaurants with many choices clean and good location. The rooms are very nice and hospitality service is excellent. Would highly recommend Caesars. We hope to come again soon. We appreciate the good service that was given to us.
50,Zandra at the check-in desk was so friendly. She gave us an upgraded room for our anniversary and set us up for a pool view. We had a concierge text service which was a nice add to the vacation. We had a great time! Stayed 3 nights in the Octavius Tower.
50,Great trip....Always thanking Caesar each time ...I always marvel at the scene no matter where I'm at on the property. It was birthday this time around and I felt special all week. Gambling was easy and I was a winner...Thanks again Caesar
50,"Caesars Palace is the #1 in gaming and R/R environment employees are friendly and courteous. The Buffet @ the""Baccanal"" has bountiful of scrumptious selections of items and no wonder it was voted @1 in Las Vegas. (5) star for my vote."
50,The staff was helpful and friendly and the facilities were clean. The room was updated and housekeeping kept the room fresh and turned over. The pool was great! The wait staff was prompt and friendly.
50,Had great spacious room. We had a great view of the strip. Eat at the Americanos Cafe. I had breakfast and lunch. The food was excellent. I am a member of Caesar's Rewards program which I highly recommend for anyone who wishes to gamble.
50,Most all staff I encountered was so pleasant and friendly. I felt they were genuinely wanting me to have an enjoyable stay.  The in house catering service was excellent! It was no hassle to host a large family gathering in my suite.
50,I have always had a great room and the service is great. Try Caesars once and you will always go back.Centrally located lots of table games more than enough slots etc. Cab lines go fast so their no waiting.
50,My fifth time staying there and everything from rooms to service to entertainment and restaurants are all excellent. The pool is especially magnificent. Cleanest hotel on strip. They get a great mix of customers diverse in age and ethnicity. Will be going back every year.
20,They charge for everything. You don‚Äôt even get free coffee in the room. They have a refrigerator that‚Äôs full of drinks and you will get charged $75.00 if you placed your personal drinks in it. Called for service they showed up 12 hours Later
50,Joselyn went above and beyond to provide excellent customer service at the front desk. The room was excellent. The view was nice. I made a request at check out and after checking with the manager Joselyn was able to make it happen for me.
50,First class hotel. Regulars three to four times a year. Food choices room and shows. Allows all in one.Homestead rates as one of the finest restaurants on the strip. Want quick bite Starbucks to all in food court. Shopping nothing matches forum shoppes.
30,I always liked caesars properties but the rewards program is terrible and not properly calculated especially when your a big gambler. Most staff is friendly and helpful but some especially the guy at diamond host was not. I am very upset with a promise of extra comp for room bill a measly 550 bucks compared to the 10k plus that is 4 customers spent in a short span of time. I expect nothing but a resolution.
50,Great experience awesome customer service and most of all a helpful and loving staff that will get you what you need when you need it ..........Also if you are a fan of Gordon Ramsey cooking they have 2 of his restaurants onsite.
50,Great place to forget that you are here for work- awesome place to remind you to have some fun! Enjoyed the spacious meeting rooms the casino and the Restaurant selections. Omnia night club is not to be missed!
50,Room was beautiful with a great view of the fountains! The location of the hotel is in a great spot and is maintained very well! No trash laying around or loud noises and parties on the floor we stayed on
40,Had a great time. Went to Caesars to play some table games and we did just that. Went to a couple bars and had a few drinks. I visit Caesars every time I go to Vegas. They took my money this time but I'll be back üòéüòã
40,Wife and I had nothing but positive comments about Caesar's Palace. From the staff down to the cleanliness of the property we had a wonderful time and would recommend Caesar's to all who travel to Las Vegas on business or vacation. My wife and I will definitely book our stay at this site. Top notch!
50,Great location nice big room. Can‚Äôt fault it at all. Not my first time here and will be returning. Every staff member we‚Äôve come across have been friendly and accommodating. Everything about this place is amazing!!
40,We do not stay at Caesars but always make sure that we come by and spend some time here. Always good dining and gambling here. Casino tends to be a little warm but the staff is nice. Shops and dining options are first rate. Looking forward to our next visit.
